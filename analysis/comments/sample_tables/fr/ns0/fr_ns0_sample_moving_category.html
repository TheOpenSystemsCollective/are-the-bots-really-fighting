The main query I have is over the changing of the location of Hebron, which is in one of the areas occupied by Israel in 1967, from the West Bank back to Israel. Clearly, that change is going to be objectionable to many people, particularly since there are UN resolutions in force calling from Israel to dismantle its settlements and withdraw its forces from the area. I'd also like to ask why you removed the reference to the fact that those killed by Baruch Goldstein were worshippers at a mosque (and according to some eyewitnesses, Goldstein did wait until they were bent in prayer before opening fire). I think that the fact that the attack was at the mosque at the Cave of the Patriarchs and that the attack is one of those referred to by the term 'Hebron massacre' are important details which help to distinguish which particular attack is being discussed. Also, those terms serve as links to other major articles. [[User:ZScarpia|ZScarpia]] 20:33, 2 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-:: Thanks for undoing the changes, Mark.

An optional high-output ''DBB'' engine with twin three-choke Webber carbs, special [[camshaft]]s, and the dual-exhaust system boasted 195&nbsp;hp (145&nbsp;kW), though this was rarer than a mid-level ''DBD'' option with triple SU carbs and 180&nbsp;hp (134&nbsp;kW).<br/> <br/>+A [[1959]] review by ''[[Road & Track]]'' magazine praised the car for everything but its $7,450 price.

The world press reports start to collect in greater numbers as Americans start to deal with the "Flying Saucer" age.<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-In 1951 AMPR change their structure and name to the ''Aeronautics & Phenomena Research Victoria'' (APRV).<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-In May, 1952 Mr. R.

Seymour, Superintendent of the ''Federal Civil Aviation Department'', Air Traffic Control Branch Melbourne, reported that Australian Intelligence officers had refused his Department permission to investigate flying saucer reports on the ground that UFO's were "security matters". (See Australian Flying Saucer Review, vol1, #2 April 1960, p1).<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-The sighting activity increases around the world and by July 1952 a ''Edger. R. Jarrold'' in the state of [[New South Wales]] starts his own one man group. He names his group the ''Australian Flying Saucer Bureau'' (AFSB).[http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/ShowImage.asp?B=1948052&S=169&T=P National Archives of Australia: A705/1, 114/1/197, digital image p169.] Jarrold group starts to get a state membership base, by May 1953, AFSB; published their first magazine called the ''Australian Flying Saucer Magazine''. <br/>-<br/>-<br/>-[[Image:AFSB1955.JPG|frame| This cover comes from the 6th edition of Australian Flying Saucer Bureau (AFSB) publication called the "Australian Flying Saucer Magazine".

Jarrold is seen by APRV as an independent secretive “''loose gun''”, however, both groups maintain an average working relationship.<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-Due to a greater public demand for research and information (1953 Flap) AMPR decided on Feb 6th, 1953, to form an auxiliary group called the ''Australian Flying Saucer Investigating Committee'' (AFSIC), in partnership with the ''Astronomical Society of Victoria''.<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-Such was the interest, on the 20th Nov 1953, a question was asked in the House of Representatives 'Question time' by Mr Downer (MP), about numerous sighting of UFO's over Australia.

Out of this 1954 flap, also known as the "''Victorian invasion''", come the seeds of future groups and the first hints of the stress associated with this subject. In July 1954, AFSIC released a study of 55 sightings from the flap. This 1954 event is documented in a 1987 publication called ''“The Victorian UFO report, 1954: a compilation of reports from the Victorian press”'' by Ray Fischer and Les Bristol, VUFORS [http://sincat.slv.vic.gov.au/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&PAGE=First Author; Bristol, Les - State Library of Victoria]<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-The subject came under attack by bureaucrats in an attempt to stifle the Australian public debate. Out of the broad sheet press coverage, come surprise supporters for continued investigation into the cause, for all these sightings.<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-[[Image:Ac.casey.jpg|frame| Baron Casey.]]<br/>-<br/>-Government Minister R G Casey (Later The Right Hon. [[Richard Gardiner Casey]], Baron Casey, KG, GCMG, CH, DSO, MC, PC, [[Governor-General of Australia]] - 7 May 1965 to 30 April 1969) wrote a ‘Letter to the Editor’ in an Australian newspaper dated 5 Feb 1954. The clipping included this:<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-''“I have lists of the dates over the last several years on which people have reported having seen ‘flying saucers’ in Australia and have compared them with the dates on which the earth passes through the principal (sic) meteoric showers. There appears to be a noticeable relationship between these two sets of dates.”''  [http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/ShowImage.asp?B=3201258&S=10&T=P National Archives of Australia: A9778, M1/F/31, digital image p10].<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-Baron Casey was a member of the Victorian research group; such was his interest in the phenomena. However, it was his time as Minister in charge of the [[CSIRO]] and as Minister for External Affairs that Baron Casey was able to act as a much needed conduit between official research, the public and public research groups. Casey’s curiosity on subject related to the phenomena remained with him until his death in June 1976. <br/>-<br/>-<br/>-Then on Mar 1954 Jarrold is contacted by a South Australian called ''Fred Stone''. Stone agrees to become a branch of Jarrold’s group and so the AFSB(SA) is formed. But this relationship is fragile and as Jarrold’s behavior changes due to stress the relationship deteriorates. The [[RAAF]] also note problems with Jarrold, Sq Leader A.H. Birch, AFC, Air Force Head-Quarters, Victoria Barracks, Victoria, make note of this in a letter dated the 5th Apr 1955 ''"... the discussion during the brief interview I had with Mr. Jarrold mainly concerned the possibility of his Society causing embarrassment to the Royal Australian Air Force.."''<br/>-[http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/ShowImage.asp?B=1948052&S=37&T=P National Archives of Australia: A705/1, 114/1/197, digital image p37]. <br/>-<br/>-<br/>-The [[RAAF]] then change their policy and shift their help to other organisations within Australia.

The most prominent and first to re-build was under the Directorship of ''Fred Stone''. Stone forms the ''Australian Flying Saucer Research Society'' (AFSRS) based in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]] on Feb 1955. [http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/ShowImage.asp?B=1948052&S=42&T=P National Archives of Australia: A705/1, 114/1/197, digital image p42]. Stone also sees a chance to become the governing body of all Australian Ufology. He asks APRV to come under his plan and they reject the concept. However, APRV agree to extend the same relationship they extended to Jarrold’s group with John. M. Anderson (Above NAA: p42 LHS Col) as their contact. This arrangement is agreed to and APRV supplies a list of contacts for Stone on possible branch organisers. Fred Stone's plan, is too form three new state groups (Victoria, NSW, Queensland) under his control. With a new list Stone sets his plan into motion. Although each new group develops due to individuals within these groups, in the end Fred Stone has little input into their structure. His concept works at first but soon runs into administration problems due to distance between states and lines of communication.<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-In April 1956 to deal with increase in reports the ''Aeronautics & Phenomena Research Victoria'' (APRV) changes their structure and name to ''Phenomena Research Victoria'' (PRV).<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-Then on Nov 1957 the world experiences one of the biggest set of sighting. See 1957 flaps [http://www.larryhatch.net/YDAY57.html]. Australia is not immune from the event and the public need for information reaches new heights. From this up swelling, new groups form around Australia.<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-Fred Stone’s plan is either not accepted or if accepted only last one year.<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-Queensland members call for an independent structure and go their own way. They form the ''Queensland Flying Saucer Research Bureau'' (QFSRB) - now known as UFO Research Queensland (UFORQld), formed under Charles Middleborough in 1956 and with Stan Seers from 1957. These new groups are infiltrated and members come under the watchful eye of the [[Australian Security Intelligence Organisation]] ([[ASIO]]), as seen in this report dated 4th Aug 1959. Dossiers and comments on Stan Seers and QFSRB members are produced for the ASIO Regional Director. [http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/ShowImage.asp?B=8194228&S=22&T=P National Archives of Australia: A6122, digital image p22].<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-However, in Victoria the ''Australian Flying Saucer Research Society (Victorian Branch)'' (AFSRS Vic) - now known as the ''Victorian UFO Research Society'' (VUFORS), under Peter E. Norris LL.B and John Pinkney is formed on the 17th of February 1957 at [[Melbourne University]]. The first few months of 1957 it was a branch of the ''Australian Flying Saucer Research Society'' (AFSRS) but later that year it also became independent and was re-organised as the "Victorian Flying Saucer Research Society" (VFSRS) [http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/ShowImage.asp?B=756666&S=86&T=P National Archives of Australia:A703/115, 580/1/1 PART 3, digital image p86].<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-Also too the north ''Australian Flying Saucer Research Society (NSW Branch)'' (AFSRS NSW) forms - Again this branch follows Victoria's lead and decides to become independent from Fred Stone South Australia Group AFSRS. They also change their structure and name and become the ''UFO Investigation Centre'' (UFOIC) under Dr. W.P.

Warren (B.Sc., Ph.D) of the Aeronautical Research Laboratories Melbourne, inventor of the [[Flight data recorder]], was the guest speaker (See Australian Flying Saucer Review, vol 1 #2 April 1960 p18). Warren states "This phenomenon may be too hard to crack using present technology, something is wrong with our view".<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-March 1st, 1960, VFSRS guest speaker at their special general meeting is the Reverend Norman Crutwell of New Guinea.<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-The Australian space industry is in full swing and slowly, research facilities that were based in Victoria move to [[South Australia]] and the [[Woomera]] Rocket Range. These departments changes start to effect administration and membership at PRV, so to keep up with the changing world, in 1961 the old AMPR again change their structure and name from ''Phenomena Research Victoria'' (PRV) to today's ''Phenomena Research Australia'' (PRA).<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-In 1963 researcher Paul Norman arrives in Australia from the United States of America and joins VFSRS. Norman’s arrival marks a new growth in group activity. Norman was born in Tennessee and served in the US Navy. He became interested in Australia after active service in the Pacific. Norman was a superintendent for a Hydro electric power station (and Thermal electric station) when he witnessed a UFO over his Hydro power station, because of this encounter Norman became interested in investigating the phenomena. Norman becomes a vital connection, to US investigators and facilitates their visits to Australia.<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-On February 27th, 1965, in the country town of [[Ballarat]], Victoria, Australia holds its first UFO group congregation. The conference had been arranged by W. Howard Sloane, of the ''Ballarat Astronomical Society''. So important is this event the [[RAAF]] is represented by a UFO enthusiast, no less than ''Air Marshal Sir George Jones ''[http://www.defence.gov.au/Raaf/images/for_site/former_caf/jones.jpg]. Several witnesses do keynote speeches, such as ''Rev. William Gill'' and ''Charles Brewabout'', give accounts on their very public UFO experience.<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-The conference is also important for other reasons, a new public group structure is discussion and developed and takes the name ''Commonwealth Aerial Phenomena Investigation Organisation'' (CAPIO). The assembly votes it into existence, out of proceedings lawyer Peter E. Norris LL.B(Melb) becomes CAPIO's first President, under the Patronage of Air Marshal Sir George Jones, K.B.E, C.B., D.F.C. <br/>-[http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/ShowImage.asp?B=3185253&S=50&T=P National Archives of Australia: A8520, HM1/30, digital image p50]. <br/>-<br/>-<br/>-On the 12 Oct 1966, The Department of Air writes to the [[CSIRO]] advising that ''“…Sighting of Unidentified Flying Objects have during recent months been receiving considerable publicity... it is important that the system of investigation should make the best use of resources available in Australia.”'' [http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/ShowImage.asp?B=3185253&S=49&T=P National Archives of Australia: A8520, HM1/30, digital image p49]. The DOA invited the CSIRO to comment on specific UFO cases to be sent to them by the RAAF. The minutes of the 92nd meeting of the CSIRO executive committee on 25 Oct 1966 (para 10) revealed that the CSIRO agreed to the DOA’s request. They responded on 7 Nov 1966 ''“The organisation is quite happy to assist in this way...and too provide you with comments...”'' [http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/ShowImage.asp?B=3185253&S=47&T=P National Archives of Australia: A8520, HM1/30, digital image p47].<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-----<br/>-<br/>-'''State Collaboration Fractures'''<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-For years there was a general underground friction or competitiveness between groups, focused primary on Victorian groups. The general causes are numerous, but the primary motivation was around power or leadership. Lawyer Peter Norris LL.B, was a very active and methodical spokesman. Norris and his group VFSRS pressed the need for Government research and created many of the opportunities with various Government bodies. Add the fact; all reports came to Victorian Government files and VFSRS proactive case research record, made those outside this power house feel isolated. One can see the friction in this document to ASIO in which AFSRS President Fred Stone describes the Victorian group and its President as '''''“Pink”'''''.[http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/ShowImage.asp?B=8194228&S=17&T=P National Archives of Australia: A6122, 2004/00053526, digital image p17].<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-By 1963 the South Australian group was finished, this lead to a push from Sydney, in which by taking control of the state groups magazine, UFOIC hoped that the authority would shift too their sphere. So on the 23rd Feb 1967, UFOIC V/Pres Mr. Harry O’Brian (See Letterhead - National Archives of Australia: A1336/1, 68837, digital image p12) made an application (National Archives of Australia: A1336/1, 68837, digital image p16) for copyright on the states groups magazine ''“Australian Flying Saucer Review”''. This application was made without the knowledge of the other groups, when discovered the manoeuvre ‘backfired’ totally damaged the previously semi harmonious state of collaboration. <br/>-<br/>-<br/>-Victoria and Queensland protested and the application failed, however, that was the end and VFSRS closed the door on Sydney, the fracture was complete. The relationship between southern groups and Queensland QFSRB remains strong too this day. UFOIC eventually disintegrated under Mr Fred Phillips and Bill Moser and UFOIC lapsed into silence. But the old power troubles remained right up and into the 90's. In 1991 a new breed of New South Wales group emerged under the name of ''UFO Research New South Wales'' (UFOR(NSW)). This caused problems when Mr Bill Chalker who claimed that the new group had ‘stolen’ the name from him, however, Chalker was unable to justify his rights to the name, to counter this action Chalker registered the defunct UFOIC name for his independent private use. Apart from these power struggles newer groups of the 1990’s, bridged this power divide that some well known individuals still hold to this day. <small>(Auchettl:1985)</small>.<br/>-<br/>-----<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-In 1968 the ''Victorian Flying Saucer Research Society'' (VFSRS) was re-organised  and its name was again altered - this time to the ''Victorian U.F.O. Research Society'' (VUFORS).<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-Then on the 26th June 1968, in a letter from the Australian Governments Department of External Affairs to the Secretary Prime Minister’s Department, the following policy observations are recorded; ''“…the history of this subject reveals that the more time and effort that is spent by experienced scientists in investigating the smaller becomes the residue of unexplained phenomena…in spite of these difficulties the Australian Government continue to keep records of all “sighting” and associated phenomena reported within Australian and associated territories.”'' [http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/ShowImage.asp?B=3185253&S=7&T=P National Archives of Australia: A8520, HM1/30, digital image p7].<br/>-<br/>-== 1970s ==<br/>-<br/>-On 30 Oct 1971, a symposium was held in [[Adelaide]]. The symposium, on UFOs, was organised by the SA Division of the '''Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science''' [http://www.anzaas.org.au (ANZAAS)].<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-In 1978, VUFORS changes direction following the resignation of Mr. Peter Norris, the current executive, Mrs. Judith Magee, Messrs. Paul Norman and Clive Yates, are placed in control, ensuring that continuing prosperity of VUFORS. At that time VUFORS has the largest membership of any U.F.O. organisation in the Southern Hemisphere.<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-----<br/>-'''Defence UFO Files Open'''<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-Although the UFO files had been available to Defence personnel and Civilians Defence personnel for years, these files remained closed to outside researchers. Then in Oct 1979, extensively through the efforts of VUFORS researchers and Fl/Lt Brett Biddington, (Later Group Captain - RAAF) , the RAAF invited Paul Norman and Judy Magee (Previously Royal Australian Navy – RAN) to visit the Intelligence Cell at RAAF Headquarters Support Command, [[Victoria Barracks]], Victoria, to view all the files, and copy what they wished. This was a significant ‘turn around’ by the Defence Force, but it was the start of a period of remarkable co-operation between Government Departments and Civilian groups. It was not until 1981 that the files were removed and sent to Defence HQ, Russell Office, Canberra that files became open to other civilians. (Also See Chalker:1995, p59). The strange twist to this event was the person who should have had the chance to see all the files, the past President of CAPIO & VUFORS, Mr Peter Norris, had departed ufology just under 17 months prior to the changes in policy. <small>(Auchettl:1985)</small>.<br/>-----<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-{| border="1" cellpadding="2"<br/>-|-<br/>-|'''CASE 2''' <br/>-| 1978 Oct 21st <br/>-|width=300px |Frederick [[Valentich Disappearance]]<br/>-|}<br/>-<br/>-== 1980s ==<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-== Government ==<br/>-----<br/>-<br/>-The structure of Australian Government is in three tiers. The lowest level is ''Local Council'', above that is the ''State Government'' and over these two levels sits the ''Federal Government''. Throughout the modern era of Australian Ufology, departments of the Federal government have played the major role of official inquisitor. The State Government does play a minor role, however, evidence shows us that when a State body gets involved their primary object is to pass the case up to the Federal sphere.<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-'''REPORTS:'''<br/>-<br/>-RAAF dealt with more than 400 between 1950<->1959 and over 1,300 reports between 1960<->1980.

Therefore, the RAAF was not going to investigate or collect any more reports from that date on.

The term was coined and popularized by [[Stephen Colbert]] after he used it during the first episode of his [[satire|satirical]] television program ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', as the subject of a segment called ''The Wørd''.<br/> <br/>-The Community of Sant'Egidio was founded in [[Rome]] in 1968 by a group of Roman high school students led by [[Andrea Riccardi]]. It is named after the Roman [[Church of Sant'Egidio]] (Italian for [[Saint Giles]]) in [[Trastevere]], its first permament meeting place.  Since 1968, the community has gathered each night to pray and read from the Bible, reflecting on the Gospel, eventually spreading throughout the world with a mission of helping those in need. Their activities include setting up refuges for the old, hospices for AIDS patients, and printing a handbook titled "Where to Eat, Sleep, and Wash in Rome" as gifts to the homeless.<br/>+By using the term as part of his satirical routine, Colbert seeks to critique the tendency to rely upon "truthiness", and its use as an [[appeal to emotion]] in contemporary socio-political discourse. <!--Suggest including more here on the context in which the tendency arises. ---> <br/> <br/>-The charitable efforts of Sant'Egidio also led it to be a well-regarded mediator of peace negotiations. In the late 1980s, the Community came to the realization that their humanitarian efforts in [[Mozambique]], then torn by the [[Mozambican Civil War]], could not succeed without peace.  In 1990, the Community was accepted by the ruling [[Front for Liberation of Mozambique]] and rebel [[Mozambican National Resistance]] as a mediator, playing a key role in the [[Rome General Peace Accords]] signed in 1992.  They continue peace initiatives in [[Algeria]], the [[Balkans]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], and other areas, in the belief that war is the "mother of every poverty”.<br/>+Although Colbert did not [[neologism|coin]] the term, based as it is on a variation of the archaic term "truthy" in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], he has certainly introduced it to a mainsteam audience. "Truthiness" was selected as the [[2005]] Word of the Year by the [[American Dialect Society]] as a unique reflection of the year's [[zeitgeist]]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' also referred to the term as one of nine words that captured the spirit of 2005, while an [[etymology]] professor has predicted that the term as defined by Colbert will enter the [[English language]] to the degree that it will soon be included in English dictionaries.<br/>+ <br/>+==Colbert's "truthiness"==<br/>+Colbert introduced the word "truthiness" on the premiere episode of ''The Colbert Report'', on [[October 17]], 2005. He came up with the idea of "truthiness" just moments before filming for the show began. [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11182033/site/newsweek/page/3/] He used "truthiness" in a monologue that emphasized its role as an [[irony|ironic]] political [[polemic]] compressed into a single word, as demonstrated in the following excerpts:<br/> <br/>-===Awards===<br/>-The Community of Sant'Egidio has received [http://www.santegidio.org/it/pace/premi.htm numerous honors and recognitions].

As such, Colbert seems to have unknowingly re-invented the word, though he also invented a new, ironic meaning for it, where the original meaning was a straightforward variant of "truthfulness". This distinction is consistent with the announcement by the American Dialect Society, in that it credits "truthiness" as "Recently popularized on the ''Colbert Report''" rather than "invented".<br/>+<br/>+Colbert gave a rare interview out of character with [[The Onion]]'s A.V. Club, in which he responded to the question, "What's your take on the 'truthiness' imbroglio that's tearing our country apart?" by elaborating on the critique he intended to convey with the word "truthiness":<br/>+<br/>+:"Truthiness is tearing apart our country, and I don't mean the argument over who came up with the word...<br/>+<br/>+:"It used to be, everyone was entitled to their own opinion, but not their own facts. But that's not the case anymore. Facts matter not at all. Perception is everything. It's certainty. People love the president because he's certain of his choices as a leader, even if the facts that back him up don't seem to exist. It's the fact that he's certain that is very appealing to a certain section of the country. I really feel a dichotomy in the American populace. What is important? What you want to be true, or what is true? ...<br/>+<br/>+:"Truthiness is 'What I say is right, and [nothing] anyone else says could possibly be true.' It's not only that I ''feel'' it to be true, but that ''I'' feel it to be true. There's not only an emotional quality, but there's a selfish quality."

[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30A16F83B5B0C768EDDA90994DD404482] The article specifically discussed the segment on "truthiness", although the ''Times'' misreported the Word as "trustiness". In its [[November 1]] issue, the ''Times'' ran a correction clarifying that the Word had been "truthiness", not "trustiness". On the next episode of the ''Report'', Colbert took the ''Times'' to task for the error, pointing out (with ironic relish) that "trustiness" is "not even a word".<br/>+<br/>+In its [[December 25]] issue, the ''Times'' again discussed "truthiness", this time as one of nine words that had captured the year's zeitgeist, in an article entitled "2005: IN A WORD; TRUTHINESS" by Jacques Steinberg. In crediting "truthiness", Steinberg said, "the pundit who probably drew the most attention in 2005 was only playing one on TV: Stephen Colbert..." [http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00617F93E540C768EDDAB0994DD404482]<br/>+<br/>+In the [[January 22]] issue, columnist [[Frank Rich]] used the term "truthiness" seven times, with credit to Colbert, in a column entitled "Truthiness 101: From Frey to Alito", to discuss [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] portrayals of several issues (including the [[Alito]] nomination, [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]] response, and [[Murtha]]'s wartime record). Rich emphasized the extent to which "truthiness" had quickly become a cultural fixture, saying, "The mock Comedy Central pundit Stephen Colbert's slinging of the word 'truthiness' caught on instantaneously last year precisely because we live in the age of truthiness." [[Editor & Publisher]] magazine reported on Rich's use of "truthiness" in his column, saying he "tackled the growing trend to 'truthiness,' as opposed to truth, in the U.S." [http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001882874]<br/>+<br/>+The January 30 issue of the ''Times'' included an article entitled "How Oprahness Trumped Truthiness" by David Carr, although the article itself did not refer to "truthiness". Because the editors write the headlines in all stories for the ''Times'', the "truthiness" reference was added by the editors to describe the theme of Carr's article.

The Society described their rationale as follows:<br/>+<br/>+:'In its 16th annual words of the year vote, the American Dialect Society voted truthiness as the word of the year. First heard on the Colbert Report, a satirical mock news show on the Comedy Channel [sic], truthiness refers to the quality of stating concepts or facts one wishes or believes to be true, rather than concepts or facts known to be true.

As Stephen Colbert put it, “I don’t trust books. They’re all fact, no heart.” Other meanings of the word date as far back as 1824.'<br/>+<br/>+This change was likely made to reflect the fact that word had existed prior to the October 17 show.<br/>+<br/>+=="Snub" by the Associated Press, and Colbert's response==<br/>+[[Image:Colbert on notice board.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Colbert putting Michael Adams on the "On Notice" board, for defining "truthiness" in a news story that did not mention Colbert.]]<br/>+<br/>+The [[Associated Press]] reported on the American Dialect Society's selection of truthiness as the Word of the Year [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002725801_words07.html], including the following comments by one of the voting linguists:<br/>+<br/>+:'Michael Adams, a professor at [[North Carolina State University]] who specializes in [[lexicology]], said "truthiness" means "truthy, not facty." "The national argument right now is, one, who's got the truth and, two, who's got the facts," he said. "Until we can manage to get the two of them back together again, we're not going make much progress."'<br/>+<br/>+On each of the first four episodes of the ''Report'' after the selection of truthiness as ''Word of the Year'', Colbert lamented that news reports neglected to acknowledge him as the source of the word. On the first of these episodes, he added Michael Adams to his "On Notice" board, and Associated Press reporter [[Heather Clark]], the author of the article, to his "Dead To Me" board [http://www.comedycentral.com/sitewide/media_player/play.jhtml?itemId=47378&ml_collection=&ml_context=show&allowMotherload=true&ml_comedian=none&poppedFrom=_shows_the_colbert_report_videos_notice_index.jhtml&].

On the following episode he called Michael Adams and asked for an apology. Though Michael Adams never apologized, Colbert twisted Adams' words and "accepted" his "apology", and took him "off notice". Adams also pointed out that "truthiness" is in the Oxford English Dictionary.<br/>+<br/>+==The Associated Press responds to Colbert==<br/>+In a strange case of life imitating art, on January 13, the first day after the four-day run of abuse of the AP on the ''Report'', the AP ran a story about ''The Colbert Report'' being upset about being snubbed by the AP, in an article entitled "Colbert: AP the biggest threat to America". [http://www.twincities.com/mld/twincities/entertainment/13612677.htm] As he has in the past, Colbert remained in character in an interview for the story, and used it to further the political satire of "truthiness"; excerpts of the story are as follows:<br/>+<br/>+:"... When an AP story about the designation sent coast to coast failed to mention Colbert, he began a [[tongue-in-cheek]] crusade, not unlike the kind his '[[muse]]', [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]], might lead in all seriousness.<br/>+<br/>+:"'It's a [[sin|sin of omission]]...' Colbert told The AP on Thursday. ... 'It's like [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] still being alive and not asking him what "[[Hamlet]]" is about,' he said.<br/>+<br/>+:"The Oxford English Dictionary has a definition for 'truthy' dating back to the 1800s. ... 'The fact that they looked it up in a book just shows that they don't get the idea of truthiness at all,' Colbert said Thursday. 'You don't look up truthiness in a book, you look it up in your gut.'<br/>+<br/>+:"Though slight, the difference of Colbert's definition and the OED's is essential. It's not your typical truth, but, as The New York Times wrote, 'a summation of what (Colbert) sees as the guiding ethos of the loudest commentators on [[Fox News]], [[MSNBC]] and [[CNN]].'<br/>+<br/>+:"Colbert, who referred on his program to the AP omission as a 'journalistic travesty,' said Thursday that it was similar to the much-criticized [[weapons of mass destruction]] reporting leading up to the [[Iraq War]]. 'Except,' he said, 'people got hurt this time.'"<br/>+<br/>+On January 14, Clark herself responded in an article entitled "EXCLUSIVE 'NEWS' -- I'm dead to Stephen Colbert". [http://www.reflector.com/featr/content/shared-gen/ap/asap/Dispatches/asap_Dispatches_The_Truthiness_Hurts.html] She furthered the rise of "truthiness" in published English in conceding, "Truthiness be told, I never had seen 'The Colbert Report' until my name graced its 'Dead To Me' board this week. ... But I will say that I watched Colbert's show for the first time... It was funny. And that's not just truthy. That's a fact." On a less conciliatory note, she also voiced the opinions that "It's not like Stephen Colbert is a [[David Letterman]] or [[Jay Leno]]", "there's no way The Associated Press is a [[The Colbert Report miscellania#Recurring segments|bigger threat to America than bears]]", and that the hundreds of Colbert fans concerned enough about "truthiness" to take the time to email her need to "get back to work... Who are you? Why are you wasting your time with this drivel?"<br/>+<br/>+==Truthiness and the James Frey controversy==<br/>+<br/>+The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' published an editorial in its January 16th issue entitled "The Truthiness Hurts", crediting the rise of "truthiness" as serendipitously providing an apt description of the [[Oprah Book Club]] controversy over  [[James Frey]]'s semi-fictional memoir ''[[A Million Little Pieces]]''. [http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/chi-0601160188jan16,1,4983997.story?ctrack=1&cset=true] In it, the ''Tribune'' said,<br/>+<br/>+:"Just as a media uproar erupts over fabrications in James Frey's best-selling memoir about his drug habit, along comes a new word that fits the situation perfectly.<br/>+<br/>+:"Truthiness is the invention of Stephen Colbert, host of the nightly Colbert Report (that's Col-bear Re-pore, for the unrefined) on Comedy Central.

And not just emotional truth or essential truth or even truthiness -- but actual, empirical, cut-the-crap truth." [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/arianna-huffington/will-americas-new-love-a_b_14809.html] Also in The Huffington Post on the same day, [[Marty Kaplan]], associate dean<br/>+of the [[USC]] [[Annenberg School for Communication]], also used "truthiness" in anticipation of the State of the Union, in a post entitled "The Ministry of Truthiness Vets the SOTU Text". [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marty-kaplan/the-ministry-of-truthines_b_14800.html] Kaplan credited Colbert in a post-script: "UPDATE: Truthiness is Registered TM (c) IP-protected non-shareware Owned Originated & Patent Pending by Stephen Colbert, Allison Silverman, and the rest of the awesome gang at The Colbert Report".<br/>+<br/>+The February 13, 2006 issue of ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine featured an article on ''The Colbert Report'' entitled, "The Truthiness Teller", which used the word "truthiness" twelve times (besides in the title). [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11182033/site/newsweek/] It recounted the career of the word "truthiness" since its popularization by Colbert, including its selection as Word of the Year by the American Dialect Society; the reportage by the AP on both the Word of the Year, and on Colbert's reaction to not being credited in its earlier reportage; the frequent use of the word "truthiness" to describe the James Frey controversy; and the heavy incorporation of the word "truthiness" by Frank Rich in the ''New York Times''.<br/>+<br/>+==Independent observations relevant to truthiness==<br/>+Colbert's definition of "truthiness" effectively encapsulates an observation by [[George Orwell]]: "We are all capable of believing things which we know to be untrue, and then, when we are finally proved wrong, impudently twisting the facts so as to show that we were right." <br/>+<br/>+The concept of truthiness also bears a considerable resemblance to [[Harry Frankfurt]]'s definition of [[bullshit]] from his essay, ''[[On Bullshit]]''.  He argues that bullshitters misrepresent themselves to their audience not as liars do, that is, by deliberately making false claims about what is true. In fact, bullshit need not be untrue at all. Rather, bullshitters seek to convey a certain impression of themselves without being concerned about whether anything at all is true.<br/>+<br/>+==Scientific basis of truthiness==<br/>+In January 2006, a group of scientists led by [[Drew Westen]] announced their results of a study in which [[fMRI]] brain imaging showed that thirty self-described committed Democrats or Republicans, fifteen of each, used emotional areas of their brains when responding to facts that contradicted their favored presidential candidate, while the reasoning centers of their brains did not show indications of use. Specifically, when the Republican test subjects were shown self-contradictory quotes by [[George W. Bush]], and when the Democratic test subjects were shown self-contradictory quotes by [[John Kerry]], and asked to respond to them, both groups tended to explain away the apparent contradictions. While they did so, the fMRI scanners showed peaks in brain activity in areas such as the orbital [[frontal cortex]], which regulates emotional processing, and the [[cingulate]], which regulates forgiveness. At the same time, the dorsolateral [[prefrontal cortex]], which is associated with rational thought, as well as conscious effort to ignore emotion, did not display activity.<br/>+<br/>+As Dr. Westen said, "None of the circuits involved in conscious reasoning were particularly engaged... Essentially, it appears as if partisans twirl the cognitive kaleidoscope until they get the conclusions they want... Everyone... may reason to emotionally biased judgments when they have a vested interest in how to interpret 'the facts.'"

[[User:Andries|Andries]] reports that the articles '''A guru accused''' and '''Sai Baba as Shiva-Shakti: a Created Myth? Or?''' shares both similarities with and differences from her 1994 article.  Among the differences, the 1994 article contains information specific to the Netherlands, not mentioned in the other articles, and 1994 article  treated only allegations of inappropriate sexual approaches to Tal Brooke and Keith Ord while here later articles also report upon other allegations of sexual misconduct.  <br/>+<br/>+<br/>+<br/>+<br/>+<br/>+Unfortunately, we must rely on Andries assessment of the situation, which I cannot accept. The published article ''"De Sai Paradox"'' is '''only''' written in Dutch and I don't read Dutch. How this one published article became two separate articles equal in length, if not more, is beyond me. The references for ''"De Sai Paradox"'' are hardly comparable, with the references used on ''"Sai Baba as Shiva-Shakti: a Created Myth? Or?"'' and ''"A Guru Accused"''. Also, one does not notice any references to Sam Young, Helena Klitsie and other names. It seems the main part that is copied is about Deborah Swallow.

Suppose you are writing a Wikipedia entry on a famous physicist's Theory X, which has been published in peer-reviewed journals and is therefore an appropriate subject for a Wikipedia article. However, in the course of writing the article, you contact the physicist and he tells you: "Actually, I now believe Theory X to be completely false." Even though you have this from the author himself, you cannot include the fact that he said it in your Wikipedia entry.<br/>+<br/>+In the current situation, it may be a fact that Nagel's English articles report many of the same facts  as her published article.  However, it seems to the mediator that statements by Nagel are analogous to  the famous physicists statements about his/her current (dis)belief in Theory X.  --[[User:BostonMA|BostonMA]] 03:24, 12 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+== Policy Issue (Verifiability of Non-English Language Source) ==<br/>+<br/>+The (name) article is written in Dutch.

Of course I have avoided answering some other questions, such as whether the edits you may make would be considered appropriate for the article, and whether the journal(?) in which the article was published is reliable.

[[User:Andries|Andries]] 04:01, 12 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::What is the actual name of the article, and what number or issue of the journal was the article published?<br/>+:::The name of the article is ''De Sai Paradox: Tegenstrijdigheden van en rondom Sathya Sai Baba''/''The Sai Paradox:contradictions of and surrounding Sathya Sai Baba'' from the series ''Religieuze bewegingen in Nederland''/''Religious movements in the Netherlands'' nr. 29 ''Sekten''/''Cults/Sects'', published by the Free University Amsterdam press, edited among others by [[Reender Kranenborg]] (1994) ISBN 9053833412 [[User:Andries|Andries]] 13:20, 12 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+Why Nagel's article was published by the Free University of Amsterdam is a mystery. In 1994, Nagel had '''no''' credentials and no college accreditations. Even Andries cannot say how she got her paper published in this University Journal. No one knows what criteria were used to accept her paper. It is my opinion that the paper in question was a college assignment (just as Nagel stated her other papers were).<br/>+<br/>+Nevertheless, the fact of the matter is that the article was published, in 1994, in a University Journal specific to sects. The Journal is called ''"Sekten"''. Nagel's article was called ''"De Sai Paradox"''. It is published on Anti-Sai Sites only in Dutch. It has '''not''' been translated into English. I believe the relevant information is as follows: Free University Amsterdam; 'Sekten', 1994, nr. 29; ISBN 9053833412 [[User:SSS108|SSS108]] 05:03, 12 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+::The information is correct, though I do no know whether it  is a Journal. The tone and the contents of the various articles in that magazine is not anti-cult. Yes, sometimes it is critical, and sometimes very critical, but in almost all cases the criticism is justified. (The series also got better over the years.) [[User:Andries|Andries]] 11:39, 12 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+::The editors select suitable authors and if there are no suitable authors are available then they publish nothing. I read that Kranenborg could not find suitable authors for Opus Dei or the catholic church (I do not remember which one) and no article was published. The reason for this selection procedure is obvious: these professors, like Kranenborg,  have no time to take years to study a single movement from nearby and using [[participant observation]]. Apart from that, Nagel wrote in her 1994 article that it was written in close collaboration with Richard Singelenberg and Dutch psychology professor Piet Vroon. The first wrote quite a lot of articles about cults (too lenient and too sympathetically for my taste) and the latter a lot about SSB in Dutch newspaper de Volkskrant. Vroon was first neutral and interested in SSB but later became completely anti after a visit to the ashram and he became sometimes unreasonably and excessively critical. [[User:Andries|Andries]] 12:21, 12 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+== Statements by Parties to Mediation ==<br/>+<br/>+I have given my opinions, on the some of the issues related to the usability of Alexandra Nagel's work.  Please express you own opinions here.  --[[User:BostonMA|BostonMA]] 03:24, 12 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+<br/>+:One major difference that she explicitly states is that she was shocked to learn that SSB not only molested young men, but also boys and also the amount of money involved. Another major difference, but not essential and understandable, is that in her updated articles, she does not treat the controversy about SSB in the Netherlands extensively. The fourth major difference is of course, that in the 1994 article she only treated the inappropriate sexual approaches to Tal Brooke and Keith Ord and now the list is longer. I cannot think of any other major difference of her updated articles. She now uses two articles for what she wrote in 1994 in one article. [[User:Andries|Andries]] 03:59, 12 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+I would argue for caution in accepting the inclusion of this magazine as being ''de facto'' reputable. On a previous dispute with Andries, he included an article published in the same magazine written also by a student. This magazine publishes many types of articles, and is not a publication that publishes peer reviewed articles. One thing would be of interest: has Nagel been published at all in any peer reviewed publication?. Googling her name seeems only brings back sites related to critics, or ''ahem'' the articles in Wikipedia and Wikipedia mirrors. Having said that, her article should be cited in the article but within proportion to her reputation. [[User:Jossi|&asymp; jossi  &asymp;]] <small>[[User_talk:Jossi|t]] &bull; [[Special:Emailuser/Jossi|@]]</small> 05:38, 12 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:To answer Jossi's question whether Nagel has been published in a peer reviewed Journal, Nagel published an article about [[Wolf Messing]] in relation to SSB in ''Tijdschrift voor Parapsychologie''/''Journal for parapsychology'' 368, vol. 72 nr 4, Dec. 2005, pp. 14-17. It's in Dutch. She also thanked Robert Prddy and Brian Steel in that article for the information they provided in the after word. An unpublished older English language version of that article is linked to in that Wikipedia article. A [[google test]] is fine to assess whether somebody is notable enough to have an article about, but it is not a good way to assess the reputability of sources. Also, it is my opinion that the quality of Nagel's article is better than the article by Haan that Jossi is referring to and that I have used a source in another article. It is my opinion that if you want to cite Nagel's article in proportion to the reputability of that article, relative to the reputability of other articles used as a source in the SSB article then Nagel's article deserves a prominent citation. Only the Daily Telegraph and India Today articles are as detailed and have equal or near-equal reputability, I think. [[User:Andries|Andries]] 12:21, 12 February 2006 (UTC) (amended for grammar)<br/>+:It is true that the magazine sometimes accepts articles by guest contributors, but the status of the article is explicitly stated by the editor. Everything indicates that the article by Nagel was a [[peer review]]ed official publication by the Free University of Amsterdam, like the majority of the articles in that magazine.

Or?"'' and ''"A Guru Accused"'' shows that they are not one and the same. The only part that seems to be duplicated is the article about Deborah Swallow. Since ''"Sai Baba as Shiva-Shakti: a Created Myth? Or?"'' and ''"A Guru Accused"'' were not published in '''any''' notable references, they constitute original research. Also, to date, Andries has '''never''' claimed that the other 2 articles were taken from ''"De Sai Paradox"''. This is a recent, newfound, revelation.<br/>+<br/>+Also, it is important to point out that Alexandra Nagel is a self-professed Anti-Sai Activist since 1990. All of her writings are written from a critics POV. Her articles are not neutral and I have pointed out numerous errors in her writings. These writings were college assignments and Nagel rehashed the same information over and over. [[User:SSS108|SSS108]] 05:35, 12 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+:Articles need not to be neutral to warrant inclusion. Wikipedia cares about verifiable sources, not neutral sources.

I am simply pointing out that Nagel is a critic. The way she is described by Andries, gives the impression that she is neutral. I just want to make it clear she isn't. [[User:SSS108|SSS108]] 05:51, 12 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+:No, I don't think so. Andries is arguing for her status as a reputable source. My take is that she is a source and should be cited, but not put her on a pedestal of reputability that may not be warranted.  [[User:Jossi|&asymp; jossi  &asymp;]] <small>[[User_talk:Jossi|t]] &bull; [[Special:Emailuser/Jossi|@]]</small> 05:55, 12 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+I agree. Her article, ''"De Sai Paradox"'' is published in a University Journal. Therefore, I have no problems if Andries cites that particular paper. I have problems when Andries tries to cite Nagel's other papers that were '''never''' published in any notable references. It appears that since Nagel had one article published in a notable reference, Andries is wrongfully elevating all of Nagel's papers to the same level. [[User:SSS108|SSS108]] 06:16, 12 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+:It is a practical matter of course. Do we want Wikipedia to use an outdated Dutch language article or do we want Wikipedia to use a reasonable up to date English article? I chose the latter for practical reasons.

Despite the formal separation between Church and State (and thus education), one University, the Free University of Amsterdam (VU) has an interesting history in relation to creationism. The university has always traditionally been a 'Christian' university. Abraham Kuyper, a cleric and politician founded it in 1880. His intention with the University was to give the religious youth the possibility to profess science on biblical principles. Being an Orthodox Protestant, Kuyper was also strongly opposed to Darwinism. Nowadays the University still requires employees to be (Orthodox) Protestant.<br/>+This might explain why the University puts out an Anti-Sect Journal. [[User:SSS108|SSS108]] 06:03, 12 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+From the VU's website:<br/>+:Vrije Universiteit's origins are rooted in the Christian faith. This is why we attach such great importance to our social role. We take the view that academic work cannot be divorced from the concerns of society, in terms of standards, values, philosophy and religion.<br/>+:Abraham Kuyper, Prime Minister of the Netherlands from 1901 to 1905, founded Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in 1880. At first the university was only open to Reformed Christians and was entirely financed by their fund-raising efforts and donations. Since the 1960s, however, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam has been open to everyone and funded in the same way as the other Dutch universities, although it still retains its tradition of Christian standards and values. This finds expression in the emphasis placed upon social involvement in the university’s teaching and research programmes.<br/>+<br/>+When citing material published from this University, we need to provide to readers the very relevant information that that this University represents a Christian POV. I intent to add this statement to the ''many'' references added by Andries to many articles in Wikipedia.

They are adapted for feeding on [[nectar]] and [[pollen]], the former primarily as an energy source, and the latter primarily for [[protein]] and other nutrients. Most pollen is used for food for the [[larva|brood]]. <br/>+<br/>+Bees have a long [[proboscis]] that enables them to obtain the nectar from [[flower]]s. Bees have [[antennae]] made up of thirteen segments in males and twelve in females. They have two pairs of wings, the back pair being the smaller of the two. <br/>+<br/>+Bees play an important role in [[pollination|pollinating]] [[flowering plant]]s, and are called [[pollinator]]s. Bees may focus on gathering nectar or on gathering pollen, depending on their greater need at the time. Bees gathering nectar may accomplish pollination, but bees that are deliberately gathering pollen are more efficient pollinators. It is estimated that one third of the human food supply depends on insect pollination, most of this accomplished by bees.<br/>+<br/>+Bees are fuzzy and carry an electrostatic charge, thus aiding in the adherence of pollen. Bees periodically stop foraging and groom themselves to pack the pollen into specialized [[pollen basket]]s which are on the legs of honeybees and some other [[species]], and on the ventral [[abdomen]] on other species.<br/>+<br/>+Bees are extremely important as pollinators in [[agriculture]], with [[pollination management|contract pollination]] having overtaken the role of [[honey]] production for beekeepers in many countries. [[Monoculture]] and [[pollinator decline]] have increasingly caused honeybee keepers to become [[Seasonal human migration|migratory]] so that bees can be concentrated in areas of pollination need at the appropriate season. Many other species of bees are increasingly cultured and used to meet agricultural pollination need. Bees also play a major, though not always understood, role in providing food for birds and wildlife. Many of these bees survive in refuge in wild areas away from agricultural spraying, only to be poisoned in massive spray programs for [[mosquito]]es, [[gypsy moth]]s, or other [[Pest (animal)|pest]] insects.<br/>+<br/>+There are over 16,000 described species, and possibly around 30,000 species in total. Many species are poorly known. The smallest bee is a dwarf bee (Trigona minima) and it is about 2.1 mm (5/64") long. The largest bee in the world is the [[Megachile pluto]], which can be as large as 39 mm (1.5").<br/>+<br/>+== Eusocial and quasisocial bees ==<br/>+Bees may be solitary, or may live in various sorts of communities. The most advanced of these are [[eusocial]] colonies, found among the [[honeybee]]s and [[stingless bee]]s. Sociality is believed to have evolved separately in different groups of bees.<br/>+<br/>+Eusocial bees live in colonies, each of which has a single [[Queen (bee)|queen]], together with [[worker bee|worker]]s and [[drone (bee)|drone]]s. When humans provide a home for a colony, the structure is called a [[Beehive (beekeeping)|hive]]. A hive can typically contain up to about 40,000 individual bees at their annual peak, which occurs in the spring, but usually have fewer.<br/>+<br/>+Visiting flowers is a dangerous occupation, with very high mortality rates. Many [[assassin bug]]s and [[crab spider]]s hide in flowers to capture unwary bees. Others are lost to birds in flight. [[Insecticide]]s used on blooming plants can kill large numbers of bees, both by direct poisoning and by contaminating their food supply. A honeybee queen may lay 2000 eggs per day during spring buildup, but she also must lay 1000 to 1500 eggs per day during the foraging season, simply to replace daily casualties.<br/>+<br/>+[[Bumblebee]]s (''Bombus terrestris'', ''B. pratorum'', et al.) are referred to as quasisocial because the queen bee is typically able to survive on her own for at least a short time (unlike queens in eusocial species who must be cared for at all times). Bumblebee colonies typically have from 50 to 200 individual bees at peak population, which occurs in mid to late summer.<br/>+<br/>+The population value of bees depends partly on the individual efficiency of the bees, but also on the population. Thus, while bumblebees have been found to be about ten times more efficient pollinators on cucurbits, the total efficiency of a colony of honeybees is much greater, due to greater numbers. Likewise, during early spring orchard blossoms, bumblebee populations are limited to only a few queens, thus they are not significant pollinators of early fruit.<br/>+<br/>+[[Image:Bumblebee_closeup.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bumblebee]]]]<br/>+<br/>+The life cycle of bumblebees begins in the spring when the queen bee rises from hibernation. At this time the queen bee is the one who does all the work as there are no worker bees to do the work yet. She searches for a place to build her nest and she builds the honeypots. She also does the foraging to collect nectar and pollen. Bumblebee colonies die off in the autumn, after raising a last generation of queens, which survive individually. Interestingly bumblebee queens sometimes seek winter safety in honeybee hives, where they are sometimes found dead in the spring by [[beekeeper]]s, presumably stung to death by the honeybees. It is not known whether any succeed in winter survival in such an environment.<br/>+<br/>+With [[honeybee|honeybees]], which survive winter as a colony, the queen begins egg laying in mid to late winter, to prepare for spring. This is most likely triggered by longer day length. She is the only fertile [[female]], and deposits all the [[Egg (biology)|egg]]s from which the other bees are produced. Except a brief mating period, when she may make several flights to mate with drones or if she leaves in later life with a [[Swarming (honeybee)|swarm]] to establish a new [[Colony (biology)|colony]], the queen rarely leaves the hive after the [[larva]]e have become full grown bees. The queen deposits each egg in a cell prepared by the worker bees. The egg hatches into a small larva which is fed by ''nurse'' bees (worker bees who maintain the interior of the colony). After about a week (depending on species), the larva is sealed up in its cell by the nurse bees and begins the pupal stage. After another week (again, depending on species), it will emerge an adult bee.<br/>+<br/>+The larvae and [[pupa]]e in a frame of honeycomb are referred to as frames of [[brood (honeybee)|brood]] and are often sold (with adhering bees) by beekeepers to other beekeepers to start new beehives.<br/>+<br/>+[[Image:Queencell_0017.JPG|thumb|left|Peanut-like queen brood cells are extended outward from the brood comb]]<br/>+<br/>+Both workers and queens are fed ''[[royal jelly]]'' during the first three days of the larval stage. Then workers are switched to a diet of pollen and nectar or diluted honey, while those intended for queens will continue to receive royal jelly. This causes the larva to develop to the pupa stage more quickly, while being also larger and fully developed sexually. Queen breeders consider good nutrition during the larval stage to be of critical importance to the quality of the queens raised, good genetics and sufficient number of [[mating]]s also being factors. During the larval and pupal stages, various parasites can attack the pupa/larva and destroy or damage it.<br/>+<br/>+Queens are not always raised in the typical horizontal brood cells of the [[honeycomb]]. The typical queen cell is specially constructed to be much larger, and have a vertical orientation. However, should the workers sense that the old queen is weakening, they will produce emergency cells known as supercedre cells. These cells are made from a cell with a egg or very young larva. These cells protrude from the comb. As the queen finishes her larval feeding, and pupates, she moves into a head downward position, from which she will later chew her way out of the cell. At pupation the workers cap or seal the cell. Just prior to emerging from their cells, young queens can often be heard "piping." This is considered likely to be a challenge to other queens for battle.<br/>+<br/>+[[Image:Bee swarm.jpg|thumb|right|Bee Swarm- bees are remarkably non aggressive in this state as they have no hive to protect, and can be captured with ease]]<br/>+<br/>+Worker bees are infertile females, however in some circumstances they may lay unfertile eggs. Worker bees secrete the [[Beeswax|wax]] used to build the hive, clean and maintain the hive, raise the young, guard the hive and forage for nectar and pollen.<br/>+In [[honeybees]], the worker bees have a modified [[ovipositor]] called a [[stinger (organ)|stinger]] with which they can sting to defend the hive. Contrary to popular belief, the bee will ''not'' always die soon after stinging: this is a misconception based on the fact that a bee will always die shortly after stinging a ''[[mammal]]''; however, the stinger evolved primarily for inter-bee combat.<br/>+<br/>+Drone bees are the [[male]] bees of the colony. Drone honeybees do not forage for nectar or pollen. The primary purpose of a drone bee is to [[fertilization|fertilize]] a new queen. Drones mate with the queen in flight. They die immediately after mating.<br/>+<br/>+In some species, drones are suspected of playing a contributing role in the temperature regulation of the hive. Drone bees have no stinger, since a stinger is actually a modified ovipositor.<br/>+<br/>+Queens live for up to three years, while workers have an average life of only three months (during the foraging season, but longer in places with extended winters).<br/>+<br/>+Honeybee queens release [[pheromone]]s to regulate hive activities, and worker bees also produce pheromones for various communications.<br/>+<br/>+[[Image:Bee1web.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Honeybee]] with tongue partly extended]]<br/>+<br/>+By collecting nectar from [[flower]]s, bees produce [[honey]], which is a clear liquid consisting of nearly 80% water with complex sugars.  The collecting bees store the nectar in a second [[stomach]] and return to the hive where worker bees remove the nectar. The worker bees digest the raw nectar for about 30 minutes using [[enzyme]]s to break up the complex sugars into simpler ones. Raw honey is then spread out in empty honeycomb cells to dry, which reduces the water content to less than 20%. When nectar is being processed, honeybees create a [[ventilation|draft]] through the hive by fanning with their [[wing]]s. Once dried, the cells of the honeycomb are sealed (capped) with wax to preserve the honey. <br/>+<br/>+Honey itself is so sweet that [[bacterium|bacteria]] cannot grow on it, and dry enough that it does not support [[yeast]]s.  [[Anaerobic bacteria]] may be present and survive in ''[[spore]]'' form in honey, however, as well as anywhere else in common environments. Honey (or any other sweetener) which is diluted by the non-acidic digestive fluids of [[infant]]s, can support the transition of [[botulism]] bacteria from the spore form to the actively growing form which produces a [[toxin]]. When infants are weaned to solid foods, their [[digestive system]] becomes [[acid]]ic enough to prevent such growth and [[poison]]ing. No sweeteners should be given to infants prior to [[weaning]].<br/>+<br/>+When a hive detects smoke, many bees become remarkably non aggressive. It is speculated that this is a defense mechanism; wild colonies generally live in hollow trees, and when bees detect smoke it is presumed that they prepare to evacuate from a forest fire, carrying as much food reserve as they can. In this state, defense from predation is relatively unimportant; saving as much as possible is the most important activity.<br/>+<br/>+=== Honeybee Queens===<br/>+Periodically, the colony determines that a new queen is needed.  There are three general triggers.<br/>+# The colony becomes space-constrained because the hive is filled with honey, leaving little room for new eggs.  This will trigger a swarm where the old queen will take about half the worker bees to found a new colony, leaving the new queen with the other half of worker bees to continue the old colony.<br/>+# The old queen begins to fail.  This is thought to be recognized by a decrease in queen pheremones throughout the hive.  This situation is called supercedure.  At the end of the supercedure, the old queen is generally killed.<br/>+# The old queen dies suddenly.  This is an emergency supercedure.  The worker bees will find several eggs or larvae in the right age-range and attempt to develop them into queens.  Emergency supercedure can generally be recognized because the queen cell is built out from a regular cell of the comb rather than hanging from the bottom of a frame.<br/>+Regardless of the trigger, the workers develop the larvae into queens by continuing to feed them royal jelly.  This triggers an extended development as a pupa.<br/>+<br/>+When the virgin queen emerges, she is commonly thought to seek out other queen cells and sting the infant queens within and that should two queens emerge simultaneously, they will fight to the death.  Recent studies, however, have indicated that colonies may maintain two queens in as many as 10% of hives.  The mechanism by which this occurs is not yet known.  Regardless, the queen asserts her control over the worker bees through the release of a complex suite of pheremons called queen scent.<br/>+<br/>+After several days of orientation within and around the hive, the young queen flies to a drone congregation point - a site near a clearing and generally about 30 feet above the ground where the drones from different hives tend to congregate.  Drones find the queen by site and mate with her in midair.  After mating, the drone dies.  A queen will mate multiple times and may return several days in a row, weather permitting, until her spermathrecea <!--spelling?--> is full.  <br/>+<br/>+The queen lays all the eggs in a healthy colony.  The number and pace of egg-laying is controlled by weather and availability of resources and by the characteristics of the specific race of honeybee.  Honeybees queens generally begin to slow egg-laying in the early-fall and may even stop during the winter.  Egg-laying will generally resume in late winter as soon as the days begin to get longer.  Egg-laying generally peaks in the spring.  At the height of the season, she may lay over 2500 eggs per day - more than her own body mass.  <br/>+<br/>+The queen fertilizes each egg as it is being laid using stored sperm from the spermathrecea.  The queen will occasionally not fertilize an egg.  These eggs, having only half as many genes as the queen or the workers, develop into drones.<br/>+<br/>+===Honeybee pheromones===<br/>+Honeybees use [[pheromone (honey bee)|special pheromones]], or chemical communication, for almost all behaviors of life.  Such uses include (but are not limited to): [[mating]], alarm, [[Self-defense|defense]], orientation, [[kin]] and [[colony]] recognition, food production, and integration of colony activities.  Pheromones are thus essential to honeybees for their survival.<br/>+<br/>+==Solitary and communal bees==<br/>+Other species of bee such as the [[carpenter bee]], Orchard [[Mason bee]] (''Osmia lignaria'') and the [[hornfaced bee]] (''Osmia cornifrons'') are solitary in the sense that every female is fertile. There are no ''worker'' bees for these species. Solitary bees typically produce neither honey nor [[beeswax]]. They are immune from [[acarine]] and [[varroa]] [[mite]]s, but have their own unique [[parasite]]s, [[Pest (animal)|pest]]s and [[disease]]s. (See [[diseases of the honeybee]].)<br/>+<br/>+Solitary bees are important pollinators, as pollen is gathered for provisioning the nests with food for their brood. Often it is mixed with nectar to form a paste-like consistancey. Many solitary bees have very advanced types of pollen carry structures on their bodies. Most solitary bees are wild, with a few species being increasingly cultured for pollination.<br/>+<br/>+Solitary bees are often specialists, in that they only visit one or more species of plant (unlike honeybees and bumblebees which are generalists). In some cases only one species of bee can pollinate a [[plant]] species, and some plants are [[endangered species|endangered]] because their pollinator is [[pollinator decline|dying off]].<br/>+<br/>+Solitary bees create nests in hollow [[reed]]s, bored holes in [[wood]], or in tunnels in the ground. The female typically creates a compartment with an egg and some provisions for the resulting larva, then seals it off. A nest may consist of numerous compartments, usually the last (the closest to the entrance) being eggs that will become males. The adult does not care for the brood, and usually dies after making one or more nests. The males emerge first and are ready for mating when the females emerge. Providing nest boxes for solitary bees is increasingly popular for [[gardener]]s. Solitary bees are usually stingless or very unlikely to sting.<br/>+<br/>+While solitary females each make individual nests, some species are gregarious, preferring to make nests near others of the same species, giving the appearance to the causual observer that they are social.<br/>+<br/>+==Kleptoparasitic bees==<br/>+''Cuckoo bees'' are bumblebee look-alikes that invade bumblebee nests and lay their eggs. The bumblebees raise the young as their own. [[Megachilid]] bees also have other megachilid ''Coelioxys'' bees whose young are placed into the already provisioned nests of these solitary bees. They destroy the host larvae and eat the food.<br/>+<br/>+''See also [[Kleptoparasitism]]<br/>+<br/>+==Communication==<br/>+:"The general story of the communication of the distance, the situation, and the direction of a food source by the dances of the returning (honeybee) worker bee on the vertical comb of the hive, has been known in general outline from the work of [[Karl von Frisch]] in the middle 1950s." <br/>+<br/>+''Main article: [[Bee learning and communication]]''<br/>+<br/>+==Miscellaneous==<br/>+Bees figure more prominently in myth than any other insect. See [[Bee (mythology)]].<br/>+<br/>+Bees are the favorite meal of ''[[Bee-eater|Merops apiaster]]'', a bird. Other common [[predator]]s are [[kingbird]]s, [[mockingbird]]s, and [[dragonfly|dragonflies]].<br/>+<br/>+Bee stings have also been reputed to help alleviate the associated symptoms of [[Multiple sclerosis]], [[arthritis]], and other [[autoimmune]] diseases.

The battle was fought on a rainy day, the [[feast day]] of [[Crispin|Saint Crispin]], between the [[Military history of Britain|English and Welsh army]] of [[Henry V of England|King Henry V]] and the [[Military history of France|French army]] of [[Charles VI of France|King Charles VI]]. The latter was not commanded by the incapacitated King himself, but by the [[Constable of France|Constable]], [[Charles d'Albret]], and various notable French noblemen of the [[Armagnac (party)|Armagnac]] party. <br/> <br/>-The battle is notable for the use of the [[English longbow]]. The battle was also immortalised (and somewhat fictionalised) by [[William Shakespeare]] in his [[Shakespearean histories|history play]] ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]''. Though according to tradition the English won a decisive victory despite being outnumbered, new research contests that claim. <br/>+'''Welcome!'''<br/> <br/>-==The campaign==<br/>-[[Henry V of England|Henry V]] had invaded France for several reasons. He hoped that by fighting a popular foreign war he would strengthen his position at home. He wanted to improve his financial position by gaining lands in France which would secure him revenue. He also wanted to take nobles prisoner who would either pay ransoms or extort money from the French King in exchange for returning home. The latter tactic is a version of "[[Danegeld]]", which English kings had successfully employed before. Evidence also suggests that several lords in the region of Normandy promised him their lands when they died, but the King of France confiscated their lands instead.<br/>-<br/>-Henry's army landed in northern France on [[13 August]] [[1415]], and besieged the port of [[Harfleur]]. The [[siege of Harfleur]] took longer than expected. The town surrendered on [[22 September]], and the English army did not leave until [[8 October]]. The campaign season was coming to an end, and the English Army had suffered many casualties through disease. Henry decided to move his army to the port of [[Calais]], the only English [[stronghold]] in northern France, where they could re-equip over winter for the campaign season of 1416.<br/>-<br/>-During the siege, the French had been able to call up a large [[feudal]] army which d'Albret deployed skilfully between Harfleur and Calais, mirroring the English manoeuvres along the river Somme, thus preventing them from reaching Calais without a major confrontation. The end result was that d'Albret managed to force Henry into fighting a battle that, given the state of his army, he would have preferred to avoid.<br/>-<br/>-The catastrophic defeat that the French suffered at the ''Battle of Agincourt'' allowed Henry to fulfill all his campaign objectives. He was recognised by the French in the [[treaty of Troyes|Treaty of]] [[Troyes]] ([[1420]]) as regent and heir to the French throne. This was cemented by his marriage to [[Catherine of Valois]], the daughter of King Charles VI.<br/>-<br/>-Henry V did not live to inherit the throne of France. In [[1422]], while securing his position against further French opposition, he died of [[dysentery]] at the age 34, two months before the death of Charles VI. He was succeeded by his young son, [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], during whose reign the English were expelled from all of France except Calais by French military successes, encouraged by [[Joan of Arc]], under the new French king, [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]].<br/>-<br/>-==The Battle==<br/>-The battle was fought in the [[defile]] formed by the wood of [[Azincourt|Agincourt]] and that of [[Tramecourt]], at the northern exit of which the army under d'Albret, Constable of France, had placed itself so as to bar the way to [[Calais]]. The night of [[24 October]] was spent by the two armies on the ground, and the English had but little shelter from the heavy rain which fell. Early on the 25th, Henry deployed his army (800 men-at-arms, 5,000 archers). It is probable that the usual three "battles" were drawn up in line, each with its archers on the flanks and the dismounted men-at-arms in the centre. The English knights were clad in sturdy iron helmets and short-sleeved chain-mail tunics beneath studded leather vests, and were placed shoulder to shoulder four deep. The English archers being thrown forward in wedge-shaped salients with spikes in the ground to cause a horse charge to veer off, almost exactly as at the [[Battle of Crécy]]. Many English archers were naked below the waist due to the continuing dysentery of the march, and the English last meal was four days previous (naked and half-starved was the English condition), and once in formation the archers were not allowed to leave and had to relieve themselves right where they stood.<br/>-<br/>-The French were arrayed in three great lines called "battles" with knights in each packed with 40 men deep. On each French flank were the mounted men-at-arms, including 12 princes of royal blood, while the center contained dismounted men-at-arms. Altogether, there were roughly 24,000 Frenchmen ready to destroy 5,800 Englishmen.<br/>-<br/>-An important factor in the battle was the terrain, which was very muddy from recent rains. This deep mud favored the English force because, once knocked to the ground, the heavily armored French knights could not stand back up, eliminating the French knights as an effective force of arms. The mud was deep enough that more than one knight suffocated after being knocked into it.  The deep mud also served to prevent the French artillery from taking part in the battle. The French crossbowmen were, as usual, relegated to the rear of the knights and men-at-arms. French accounts state that prior to the battle Henry V gave a speech reassuring his nobles that if the French prevailed the English nobles would be spared death &ndash; being captured and ransomed instead. However, the common soldier would have no such luck and therefore he told them they had better fight for their lives.<br/>-[[Image:AgincourtMap.jpg|right|map]]<br/>-<br/>-For three hours after sunrise there was no fighting; then Henry, finding that the French would not advance, moved his army further into the defile. The archers dug-in pointed wooden stakes called palings, at an angle, to ward off cavalry charges, and opened the engagement with flights of arrows. It should be noted that these palings were an innovation. At [[Battle of Crécy|Crécy]] and [[Battle of Poitiers|Poitiers]], two other similar battles between the French and the English, the archers had not had them.<br/>-<br/>-The French force was not an army but a group of knights who came together at the request of Charles VI. They were undisciplined and careless of the lessons of Crécy and Poitiers, and were quickly stung into action. The French mounted men [[Charge (warfare)|charged]], only to be driven back in confusion. The constable himself headed the leading line of dismounted men-at-arms, but weighed down by their [[armour]] and sinking deep into the mud with every step, they struggled to reach and engage the English men-at-arms. For a time the fighting was severe. The thin line of the defenders was pushed back and King Henry was almost beaten to the ground. But at this  moment the archers, using hatchets, swords and other weapons, penetrated the gaps in the now disordered French, who could not cope with their unarmoured assailants, and were slaughtered or taken prisoner. The second line of the French came on, only to be engulfed in the mêlée. Its leaders, like those of the first line, were killed or captured, and the commanders of the third line sought and found their death in the battle, while their men rode off to safety.<br/>-<br/>-The only success for the French was a sally from Agincourt castle behind the lines. Ysambart D'Agincourt seized the King's baggage. Thinking his rear was under attack, Henry ordered the slaughter of the captives, (who could easily have armed themselves with the weapons strewn about the field). The nobles and senior officers, wishing to maintain their ability to ransom the captives, refused the task and the job fell to the common soldiers. Henry's actions may have been savage, but if the captives were to arm themselves, his army would have been crushed between the French forces and the prisoners.<br/>-<br/>-In the morning Henry came back to the battlefield and killed any wounded French who had survived the night in the open. All the nobility had already been taken away and any commoners left on the field were too badly injured to survive without medical care. Total English losses were put at thirteen  men-at-arms (including [[Edward of Norwich, 2nd Duke of York]], a grandson of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]) and about 100 of the foot soldiers. The French lost 5,000 of noble birth killed, including the constable, three dukes, five counts and 90 barons (see below); 1000 more were taken prisoner, amongst them the [[Charles, duc d'Orléans|Duke of Orléans]] (the famous poet Charles d'Orléans) and [[Jean Le Maingre]], marshall of France.<br/>-<br/>-===Notable casualties===<br/>-karl likes cheese<br/>-*[[Antoine, Duke of Brabant|Antoine of Burgundy]], [[Duke of Brabant|Duke of Brabant and Limburg]] (b. 1384)<br/>-*[[Philip II, Count of Nevers|Philip of Burgundy]], [[Count of Nevers]] and [[Counts and dukes of Rethel|Rethel]] (b. 1389)<br/>-*[[Charles d'Albret|Charles I d'Albret]], [[Count of Dreux]], the [[Constable of France]]<br/>-*John II, Count of Bethune (b. 1359)<br/>-*[[John I of Alençon|John I, Duke of Alençon]] (b. 1385)<br/>-*[[Frederick of Lorraine|Frederick of Lorraine, Count of Vaudemont]] (b. 1371)<br/>-*Robert, Count of Marles and Soissons<br/>-*[[Edward III, Duke of Bar]] (the [[Duchy of Bar]] lost its independence as a consequence of his death)<br/>-*John VI, Count of Roucy<br/>-*[[Edward of Norwich, 2nd Duke of York]] (b. 1373)<br/>-Karl likes cheese<br/>-<br/>-==Modern re-assessment of Agincourt==<br/>-===Were archers as effective as traditionally thought?===<br/>-Recent experiments at Agincourt and elsewhere suggest that the English archers may have inflicted less damage than traditionally assumed on the heavily armoured French [[knight]]s and [[men-at-arms]], because of the recent adoption of steel (rather than iron) armour. <!-- And if someone could add specific citations for these experiments, it would be appreciated. --><br/>-<br/>-A series of tests carried out for a television programme<!-- Which programme? Please identify it. --> about Agincourt had limitations,<!-- This is saying the tests had limitations, right? Who is claiming this? Citations, please. --> such as:<br/>-* The draw weight of the [[English longbow]]s used may or may not have been correct. It is unlikely that in the tests they were using bows with the average draw weight of those found on the ship ''[[Mary Rose]]''.<br/>-* The bodkin arrow heads which were used in the tests was one of many possible designs.<br/>-* The tests assumed that the majority of armour was steel of consistent quality and that the arrow heads were of iron, when they too might have been steel.<br/>-* No test was carried out to examine what would happen at close range with arrows aimed at weak points in the armour.<br/>-* The tests also failed to account for the fact that the average English archer was the master of his trade, able to consistently hit targets in excess of two hundred yards.<br/>-<br/>-It is possible that most of the archery casualties were the less-armoured horses, causing the mounted fighters to be thrown down onto the muddy ground, where they had difficulty in rising. In addition, the French troops were exhausted by struggling through the quagmire and arrived piecemeal at the English line of battle.<br/>-<br/>-A second feature contributing to the French defeat was the funnel-shaped battlefield that caused the French forces to converge as they approached the English lines. As they moved forward, they jostled each other and tripped over the bodies of the fallen horses and men. It is possible that many actually suffocated as they were trampled into the mud by the following soldiers and knights. This suggestion has been supported by computer models and video footage used to study [[Crowd disasters|crowd disasters]] at football grounds and music concerts.<br/>-<br/>-Into this chaos, the lightly protected archers moved, more nimbly than the heavily armoured French, and were able to inflict severe damage on the enemy with their short swords, knives, mallets, and other weapons. This suggests that the archers were more effective as infantrymen than as archers.<br/>-<br/>-===Were the English as outnumbered as traditionally thought?===<br/>-Until recently, Agincourt has been feted as one of the greatest victories in British military history, but in ''Agincourt, A New History'' (2005), Anne Curry makes the claim that the scale of the English triumph at Agincourt was overstated for almost six centuries. However, it will be years before other historians will have been able to go over her data and decide whether her theory is correct.<br/>-<br/>-For a very long time, the official version was that Henry V's army was largely outnumbered by the French. From [[World War II]] until the early [[2000s]], historians believed the odds were at least four to one. However, Anne Curry theorizes that the figures had been exaggerated over the centuries for patriotic reasons{{ref|curry}}. After studying the original enrollment records at the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] in [[London]] and the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|National Library of France]] in [[Paris]], she determined that there were more English and Welsh troops than previously thought, and far fewer on the French side.<br/>-<br/>-According to her research, the French still outnumbered the English and Welsh, but only by a factor of three to two (12,000 Frenchmen pitted against 8,000 Englishmen and Welshmen). According to Curry, the Battle of Agincourt was a "myth constructed around Henry to build up his reputation as a king". The legend of the English as underdogs at Agincourt was definitely given credence in popular English culture with [[William Shakespeare]]'s [[Henry V (play)|''Henry V'']] in [[1599]]. In the speech before the battle, Shakespeare puts in the mouth of Henry V the famous line "We few, we happy few, we band of brothers".<br/>-<br/>-Some early reviewers of the book have been enthusiastic, but it remains to be seen whether her thesis will stand up to scrutiny after the book has been subjected to the critique of a wider scholarly audience.<br/>-<br/>-A later book by Juliet Barker ''Agincourt: The King, the Campaign, the Battle'' claims 6,000 English and Welsh fought against 36,000 French, that is, odds of six to one, from a French heraldic source. The same test of wider scholarly scrutiny is also yet to be withstood.<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-==Popular Myths==<br/>-It is said that the famous "[[two-fingers salute]]" derives from the gestures of [[Wales|Welsh]] [[archers]], fighting alongside the [[English people|English]] at [[Azincourt|Agincourt]]. The myth claims that the [[French people|French]] cut off two fingers on the right hand of captured [[archers]] and that the gesture was a sign of defiance by those who were not mutilated.<br/>-<br/>-However this is not true. [[Jean Froissart]] (circa 1337-circa 1404) was a historian as the author of the Chronicle, a document that is essential to an understanding of Europe in the fourteenth century and to the twists and turns taken by the Hundred Years' War.<br/>-<br/>-The Chronicle is a primary source of information. The story of the English waving their fingers at the French is told in the first person account by [[Jean Froissart]]. However, the description is not of an incident at the Battle of Agincourt, but rather at the siege of a castle in another incident during the Hundred Years War. Adding to the evidence is that by all accounts [[Jean Froissart]] died before the Battle of Agincourt, thus making it rather difficult for him to have written about it.<br/>-<br/>-==See also==<br/>-* [[Dafydd Gam]]: Welsh hero who saved Henry V's life at Agincourt<br/>-* [[William Shakespeare]]: [[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]<br/>-* [[Laurence Olivier]]: [[Henry V (1944 film)]]<br/>-* [[Kenneth Branagh]]: [[Henry V (1989 film)]]<br/>-<br/>-==Bibliography==<br/>-* ''[http://www.tempus-publishing.com/bookdetails.php?isbn=0752428284 Agincourt: A New History]'' by Anne Curry.

His parents, Martin Konigsberg and Nettea Cherrie, and his sister, Letty, lived in [[Flatbush]], [[Brooklyn]]. He attended [[Hebrew school]] for eight years, and then went to Public School 99 and then to [[Midwood High School|Midwood High]]. Nicknamed "Red" because of his red hair, he impressed students with his extraordinary talent at card and magic tricks. To raise money, he began writing [[joke|gags]] for the agent [[David O. Alber]], who sold them to newspaper columnists. Reportedly, Allen's first published joke was "I am two with Nature."  At sixteen, he started writing for show stars like [[Sid Caesar]] and began calling himself Woody Allen. He was a gifted comedian from an early age. He would later joke that when he was young he was often sent to inter-faith summer camps, in which he "was savagely beaten by children of all races and creeds."<br/>+== Jacob Adler ==<br/> <br/>-==College==<br/>-After high school, he went to [[New York University]] where he studied communication and film but, never much of a student, he soon dropped out due to poor grades. He later briefly attended [[City College of New York]].<br/>+Don't know if anyone wants to use it, but [[Jacob Adler]] had some very telling comments about the poverty of Whitechapel, when he arrived there in the winter of 1883-1884: "The further we penetrated into this Whitechapel, the more our hearts sank. Was this London? Never in Russia, never later in the worst slums of New York, were we to see such poverty as in the London of the 1880s." He further describes seeing men pushing barrows who looked as if they "had come out of their mothers already gray and old. [Adler, 1999, 232-233]<br/> <br/>-==Comedy writer==<br/>-At nineteen, he started writing scripts for ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' and others. In [[1957 in television|1957]], he won his first [[Emmy Award]].<br/>+There are 20-30 pages of interesting material about Whitechapel (and 1880s Jewish London in general) in his book.<br/> <br/>-He started writing prose and plays, and in 1960, started a new career as a [[stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]] and also began writing for the popular ''[[Candid Camera]]'' television show, even appearing in some episodes. Together with his managers he turned his weaknesses into his strengths and developed the neurotic, nervous, and shy figure famous from his later movies. He soon became an immensely popular comedian and appeared frequently in nightclubs and on television.<br/>+Reference: Adler, Jacob, ''A Life on the Stage: A Memoir'', translated and with commentary by Lulla Rosenfeld, Knopf, New York, 1999, ISBN 067941351.<br/> <br/>-Examples of Allen's standup act can be heard on the album [[Standup Comic]], including the famous routine wherein Allen describes bringing a live moose to a costume party.

The former is a national designation, the latter an ethnic one. I would imagine that a lot of the Bengalis in Banglatown are not Bangladeshi, but I don't know the neighbourhood all that well, so I could be mistaken. -- [[User:Jmabel|Jmabel]] | [[User talk:Jmabel|Talk]]<br/> <br/>-===Early films===<br/>-His first movie production was ''[[What's New, Pussycat?]]'' in [[1965 in film|1965]], for which he wrote the screenplay. It was a largely unpleasant experience for Allen as he was trapped in [[Paris]] for six months during the production. Furthermore, the studio never showed much respect for his script, altering the film to the point where it bore little resemblance to Allen's original vision. Allen's first directorial effort was ''[[What's Up, Tiger Lily?]]'' ([[1966 in film|1966]]), in which an existing [[Japan|Japanese]] spy movie was redubbed in [[English language|English]] by Allen and his friends with completely new, comic dialogue. In [[1967 in film|1967]], he also appeared in the offbeat [[James Bond]] spoof, ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]''. <br/>+:'Bangladeshi' is correct and generally in use (in fact TH council once tried to market the Brick Lane area as 'Banglatown' after Chinatown). And not only are most Asians hereabouts of Bangladeshi origin, but the majority of those are from one specific area of Bangladesh, the Sylhet region. [[User:Tarquin Binary|Tarquin Binary]] 20:33, 25 October 2005 (UTC)<br/> <br/>-===1960s and 1970s===<br/>-[[Image:woodyallen2.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Woody Allen, early 70s.]]<br/>-His first conventional directing effort was ''[[Take The Money and Run]]'' ([[1969 in film|1969]]), which was followed by ''[[Bananas (movie)|Bananas]]'', ''[[Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex (But Were Afraid to Ask) (film)|Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Sex (But Were Afraid to Ask)]]'', ''[[Sleeper (movie)|Sleeper]]'', and ''[[Love and Death]]''. In 1972, he also starred in the film version of his own play called ''[[Play It Again, Sam]]'', which was directed by [[Herbert Ross]]. All of Allen's early films are pure comedies that relied heavily on [[slapstick]], inventive [[Visual gag|sight gags]], and non-stop one-liners. Among the many notable influences on these films are [[Bob Hope]] and [[Groucho Marx]].<br/>+::Thanks. Sounds like ''Bangladeshi'' is fine if that is where they are from. Yes, I was familiar with the designation ''Banglatown'', but I believed that only implies Bengal: isn't it the ''"-desh"'' that means "land"? -- [[User:Jmabel|Jmabel]] | [[User talk:Jmabel|Talk]] 06:55, 26 October 2005 (UTC)<br/> <br/>-[[Image:anniehall.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Annie Hall DVD Cover]]<br/>-His most successful movies were produced in a ten year period starting with ''[[Annie Hall]]''; other critical and financial successes were ''[[Manhattan (1979 movie)|Manhattan]]'', ''[[The Purple Rose of Cairo]]'' (named by [[Time Magazine]] as one of the 100 best films of all time, and Allen's personal favorite) and ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]'' (winner of three [[Academy Awards]]).<br/>+:::Yes, and of course Bangladesh can be said to be a subset of Bengal. But it's all down to the partition of India and the subsequent independence of Bangladesh from Pakistan - and a crude definition of Bangladesh would be the Muslim area of Bengal. (But note, before 1971, all Bangladeshis  in the UK would have been known as Pakistanis). As it happens, the vast majority of Asians in Tower Hamlets are Muslims, while Hindus are heavily concentrated in Southall in West London. (It's not quite that ghettoised, of course, there is quite a dispersal of ethnic groups all across the city.) It's not always easy to figure out why one ethnic group settles in a particular area, but there is some evidence that in the case of Bangladeshis this may have been due to the wide employment of East Indian (as it was originally) seamen on British merchant ships who were known as [[lascars]] (Wikipedia contradicts itself on this entry, anyway, the term is widely used by Joseph Conrad, but likely considered offensive if used in any other way than historically now), but that term included Hindu seamen, and those from Africa and the Middle East too, so it does not explain everything. In any case, Bangladeshis from the Sylhet region have a long acquaintance with the sea and would have become very familiar with East London from serving on British ships.

[[User:Tarquin Binary|Tarquin Binary]] 14:41, 26 October 2005 (UTC)<br/> <br/>-[[Image:thefront.jpg|thumb|right|120px|The Front DVD Cover]]<br/>-He returned to directing in [[1977 in film|1977]]'s ''[[Annie Hall]]'', a modern classic that marked a major turn away to more sophisticated [[humor]] and thoughtful drama -- winning four [[Academy Awards]]. The film set the standard for modern romantic comedy and also started a fashion trend with the unique clothes worn by [[Diane Keaton]] in the film (the off-beat, masculine clothing, such as ties with cardigans, was actually Keaton's own). He also directed the serious drama ''[[Interiors]]'', in the manner of the great Swedish director,  [[Ingmar Bergman]], one of Allen's major influences. <br/>+::::The ward is still called "Spitalfields and Banglatown" [[User:Mrsteviec|Mrsteviec]] 15:09, 26 October 2005 (UTC)<br/> <br/>-=== 1980s ===<br/>-Most of his 1980s films, even the comedies, have somber and philosophical undertones. Many, like ''[[September (1987 movie)|September]]'' and ''[[Stardust Memories]]'', are often said to be heavily influenced by the works of European directors, most notably [[Ingmar Bergman]] and [[Federico Fellini]]. ''Stardust Memories'' was considered by many to be a biting piece of work in which the main character (played by Allen) expresses resentment and scorn for his fans. In the film, overcome by the recent death of a friend from illness, he states, "I don't want to make funny movies any more."  However, by the mid-80s Allen had begun to combine his love of both tragic and comic elements with the release of such films as ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]'', ''[[Husbands and Wives]]'' and ''[[Crimes and Misdemeanors]]''.<br/>+:::::Oops didn't know that.

When I was last in London (about 4 years, I live on the opposite side of the globe these days) the name ''Banglatown'' seemed reasonably current, and certainly was being used on signs of neighborhood businesses owned by Bangladeshis, who were hardly likely to be using an offensive term for their own ethnicity and neighborhood.<br/>+::::::::: BTW, before 1971, when Pakistan had two "wings", there a lot more people in the UK who remembered the Raj, and the word ''Bengali'' (as an ethnicity, sometimes meaning only Muslim Bengali's, sometimes including the Hindus) probably had some currency in London, though I don't really remember (most of my time in London is mid-'70s, probably only one visit before '71). -- [[User:Jmabel|Jmabel]] | [[User talk:Jmabel|Talk]] 23:05, 27 October 2005 (UTC)<br/>+::::::::::Yes, I see where you're coming from, I moved to London in '73 myself, and searching my memory, 'Bengali' ''was'' largely used, but that was only just after independence, Bangladesh was a new and unfamiliar country to UK citizens.

There was a time in the 1950s when I wanted to be a playwright, because until that time movies, which mostly came out of Hollywood, were stupid and not interesting. Then we started to get wonderful European films, and American films started to grow up a little bit, and the industry became more fun to work in than the theatre. I loved it. But now it's taken a turn in the other direction and studios are back in command and are not that interested in pictures that make only a little bit of money. When I was younger, every week we'd get a Fellini or a Bergman or a Godard or Truffaut, but now you almost never get any of that. Filmmakers like myself have a hard time. The avaricious studios couldn't care less about good films - if they get a good film they're twice as happy, but money-making films are their goal. They only want these $100 million pictures that make $500m. That's why I'm happy to work in London, because I'm right back in the same kind of liberal creative attitude that I'm used to."

One of my hobbyhorses, (that I haven't had time to pursue) is that given its importance in East London, contemporary art in the area is covered very poorly indeed in Wikipedia, but the overall subject needs a proper revamp.

Allen tells a different story on his mid-1960's standup album ''[[Standup Comic]]''.  In his act, Allen said that Harlene sued him because of a joke he made in an interview.  Harlene had been sexually assaulted outside her apartment, and according to Allen, the newspapers reported that she "had been violated."  In the interview, Allen said, "Knowing my ex-wife, it probably wasn't a moving violation." <br/>+:::Nice one! I fixed the redlink to the gallery, though.

Allen did not adopt Farrow's older adopted daughter, [[Soon-Yi Previn]]. Allen's adoptions of both Moses and Dylan were voided after he and Mia separated. Allen and Farrow separated in 1992 after Allen began a relationship with Soon-Yi. During the protracted custody battle, Farrow accused Allen of inappropriate behaviour with their seven-year-old adopted daughter Dylan. No criminal charges were ever filed.

It is the latter point that concerns me most, actually, because I fear this general tendency to make the tone of all articles on all subjects match the tone of sci/tech articles is extremley damaging to the project. I think the best editors do believe in variety for variety's sake, and an article on a colorful hard-scrabble neighborhood presents a fine opportunity for a varying tone and spirit. It makes me think of what the best zoos have done in recent decades: instead of havng absolutely every animal locked down in a tightly caged exhibit, some have been given space to run and fly.

As the controversy has grown, some of the cartoons have been reprinted in other newspapers in [[Europe]], as well as in the [[United States]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Jordan]]. The publication of the cartoons has led to significant [[civil disorder|unrest]] around the world, particularly in [[Islamic world|Islamic countries]], because Islamic teachings forbid the depiction of Muhammad as a measure against [[idolatry]] (see [[aniconism#In Islam|aniconism in Islam]]).<br/>+Some organisations and networks insist that not only the ordinary information of interest to the community is made freely available, but that all (or nearly all) meta-levels of organising and [[decision-making]] are themselves also published.  This is known as [[radical transparency]].  These organizations include: [[Wikipedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, and [[Indymedia]].<br/> <br/>-The drawings, including a depiction of Muhammad with a bomb inside or under his turban, accompanied an article on [[self-censorship]] and [[freedom of speech]], and were intended as [[satire|satirical]] illustrations. [[Flemming Rose]], the cultural editor of ''Jyllands-Posten'', commissioned twelve [[cartoonist]]s for the project and published the cartoons in response to the difficulty experienced by Danish writer [[Kåre Bluitgen]] in finding artists to illustrate his [[children's literature|children's book]] about Muhammad.

The article consisted of 12 satirical caricatures (of which only some depicted Muhammad) and an explanatory text, in which [[Flemming Rose]], ''Jyllands-Posten'''s culture editor, commented:<br/>-:''The modern, [[secularism|secular]] society is rejected by some Muslims. They demand a special position, insisting on special consideration of their own religious feelings. It is incompatible with [[contemporary]] democracy and freedom of speech, where you must be ready to put up with insults, mockery and ridicule. It is certainly not always equally attractive and nice to look at, and it does not mean that religious feelings should be made fun of at any price, but that is less important in this context. [...] we are on our way to a slippery slope where no-one can tell how the self-censorship will end.

Some of these twelve drawings portray Muhammad in different fashions; many also comment on the<br/>-surrounding self-censorship debate.  In the clockwise direction of their position in the page layout:<br/>-<br/>-* The Islamic [[star and crescent]] partially symbolizing the face of Muhammad; his right eye is the star, the crescent surrounds his beard and face.<br/>-* Muhammad with a bomb in his turban, with a lit fuse and the [[shahadah|Islamic creed]] written on the bomb. This drawing is considered the most controversial of the twelve.<br/>-* Muhammad standing in a gentle pose with a [[halo]] in the shape of a crescent moon. The middle part of the crescent is obscured, revealing only the edges which resemble horns.<br/>-* An [[abstract]] drawing of crescent moons and [[Star of David|Stars of David]], and a poem on oppression of women "Profet! Med kuk og knald i låget som holder kvinder under åget!". In English the poem could be read as: "Prophet, you crazy bloke! Keeping women under yoke"<br/>-* Muhammad as a simple wanderer, in the desert, at sunset. There is a donkey in the background.<br/>-* A nervous caricaturist, shakingly drawing Muhammad while looking over his shoulder.<br/>-* Two angry Muslims charge forward with sabres and bombs, while Muhammad addresses them with: "Rolig, venner, når alt kommer til alt er det jo bare en tegning lavet af en vantro sønderjyde" (loosely, "Relax guys, it's just a drawing made by some infidel [[South Jutland County|South Jutlander]]". South Jutland as reference would, for a Dane, [[connotation|connote]] the feeling of something like [[the middle of nowhere]]).<br/>-* An Arab-looking boy in front of a blackboard, pointing to the [[Persian language|Farsi]] chalkings, which translate into "The editorial team of Jyllands-Posten is a bunch of [[reactionary]] [[provocateur]]s". The boy is labelled "Mohammed, [[Valby]] school, 7.A", implying that this is a second-generation immigrant to Denmark rather than the founder of Islam. On his shirt is written "Fremtiden" (the future).<br/>-* Another drawing shows Muhammad [[Muhammad as a warrior|prepared for battle]], with a short sabre in one hand and a black bar censoring his eyes. He is flanked by two women in [[niqaab]]s, having only their wide open eyes visible. The subtle joke would be that if what is visible of the women and what is visible of Mohammed were subtracted from one another, then nothing would be left.<br/>-* Muhammad standing on a cloud, greeting dead [[suicide bomber]]s with "Stop Stop vi er løbet tør for Jomfruer!" ("Stop, stop, we have run out of virgins!"), an allusion to the promised reward to [[shaheed|martyr]]s.<br/>-* Another shows journalist [[Kåre Bluitgen]], wearing a turban with the [[proverb]]ial orange dropping into it, with the inscription "[[Publicity stunt]]". In his hand is a child's stick drawing of Muhammad. The proverb "an orange in the turban" is a Danish expression meaning "a stroke of luck": here, the added publicity for the book.<br/>-<br/>-And in the centre:<br/>-* A police line-up of seven people wearing turbans, with the witness saying: "Hm... jeg kan ikke lige genkende ham" ("Hm...

These freedoms have been defended vigorously ever since. Freedom of speech was abandoned temporarily only during the [[German occupation of Denmark]] during [[World War II]].<br/>-<br/>-Section 77 of the Constitutional Act of Denmark (1953) reads: “Any person shall be at liberty to publish his ideas in print, in writing, and in speech, subject to his being held responsible in a court of law.  Censorship and other preventive measures shall never again be introduced.” <ref>[http://www.folketinget.dk/pdf/constitution.pdf The Danish constitution]</ref>  The constitution can only be amended after a long process including new elections to the [[Folketing|Parliament]] and a national [[referendum]].<br/>-<br/>-Section 140 of the Danish Penal Code prohibits [[blasphemy]].

In 1984 the artist [[Jens Jørgen Thorsen]] was commissioned by a local art club to paint the wall of a railway station.  The work displayed a naked Jesus with an erect penis. <ref>[ http://www.interights.org/page.php?dir=Publication&page=wingrove.php Painting by Jens Jørgen Thorsen]</ref>  In 1992 Thorsen directed the film ''Jesus vender tilbage'' which showed Jesus as sexually active and involved with a terrorist group. <ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104551/ Danish movie Jesus vender tilbage]</ref>.  While Thorsen’s work provoked much public debate, he was not charged with any legal offence.<br/>-<br/>-Danish newspapers are privately owned and independent from the government and any action from the government to influence their writings would be heavily opposed. There are no restrictions on the political viewpoints which people may publish.<br/>-<br/>-In the 1960s, Denmark abandoned the law prohibiting [[pornography]], giving rise to widespread criticism and demonstrations around the world. Pornography became available in most shops carrying magazines, and sex shops also widely available. Selling sexual services is fully legal, and ads for sexual services can be seen in ordinary newspapers<ref>[http://ekstrabladet.dk/massage/oversigt.iasp Sexual services ads in Ekstra Bladet]</ref>.

Over the 3 month period studied, from September 1 2004 to November 20 2004, 19 out of the 24 ''Jyllands-Posten's'' editorials on "ethnic issues" were negative, while 88 out of 120 op. ed. pieces on "ethnics" were negative, and 121 out of 148 letters to the editor on "ethnics" were negative.<ref>[http://www.enar-eu.org/en/national/Denmark2004_enOK.pdf ENAR Shadow Report 2004 Denmark]</ref><br/>-<br/>-== Islamic tradition ==<br/>-{{main|Aniconism}}<br/>-<br/>-The [[Qur'an]], the Islamic holy book condemns idolatry, but has no direct condemnations of pictorial art. Direct prohibitions of pictorial art, or any depiction of sacred figures, are found in some [[Hadith |hadith]], or recorded oral traditions. <br/>-<br/>-Views regarding pictorial representation within the Muslim community have varied from group to group, and from time to time. [[Shi'a]] Muslims have been generally tolerant of pictorial representation of human figures, [[Sunni]] Muslims less so. However, the Sunni [[Ottomans]], the last dynasty to claim the [[Caliphate | caliphate]], were not only tolerant but even patrons of the miniaturists' art. Many Ottoman miniatures depict Muhammad; they usually show Muhammad's face covered with a veil or as a featureless void emanating light (depicted as flames). Pictorial surveys of Islamic religious art can be found on the internet. <ref>http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hi/hi_fimu.htm</ref><ref>http://www.superluminal.com/cookbook/index_flat_gallery.html#</ref><ref>http://www.zombietime.com/mohammed_image_archive</ref> Note that the last site also contains some extremely and intentionally offensive modern depictions of Muhammad.<br/>-<br/>-Most contemporary Muslims believe that ordinary portraits and photos, films and illustrations, are permissible. Only some [[Salafi]] and [[Islamist]] interpretations of Sunni Islam still condemn pictorial representations of any kind. Offensive satirical pictures are a somewhat different case — disrespect to Islam or to Muhammad is still widely considered [[blasphemous]] or [[sacrilegious]].<br/>-<br/>-According to the [[BBC]] "It is the satirical intent of the cartoonists, and the association of the Prophet with terrorism, that is so offensive to the vast majority of Muslims."<ref>{{news reference|firstname=Magdi|lastname=Abdelhadi|title=Cartoon row highlights deep divisions|date=[[4 February]] [[2006]]|org=[[BBC]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4678220.stm}}</ref> As Muhammad is the proto-typical Muslim this association with terrorism is comparable to a generalisation to all Muslims. Furthermore, the cartoons were published in a conservative mainstream newspaper in the context of what many Muslims perceive to be an [[Islamophobia|islamophobic]] mood in many western countries, exemplified by the [[French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools|French law on religious symbols in schools]], the short film ''[[Submission (film)|Submission]]'', and the [[2005 Sydney race riots]].<br/>-<br/>-== International reactions==<br/>-{{main|International reactions to the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy}}<br/>-What started with the problem of a Danish author to find an illustrator for his forthcoming book about Islam has become an international crisis.

They further proposed that this be coordinated in part by the Islamic Society, ''Jyllands-Posten'', and at least some of the five universities in Denmark. <ref>{{citenews|date=[[2006-02-01]]|title=Proposal on three day celebration|org=Islamisk Trossamfund|url=http://213.237.52.131/wakfweb/wabout.nsf/ByUID/2FCECF53BE66D968C12570E70050D21D?OpenDocument}}</ref> This was declined by the universities, as they do not take part in religious activities.<br/>-<br/>-The editor who originally approved the cartoons, Carsten Juste, later declared that the opponents of free speech had "won" because the furor would almost undoubtedly deter future editors from printing anything similar.

He also said that, had he known exactly what the consequences would be, that is death threats, boycotts and terror threats, he would not have printed the cartoons. <ref>{{da icon}}{{citenews|date=[[2006-02-01]]|title=Jyllands-Postens redaktør: »De har vundet«|org=Politiken|url=http://politiken.dk/VisArtikel.iasp?PageID=435166}}</ref><br/>-<br/>-Many people in Denmark have criticised the government's handling of the affair, particularly the prime-minister's decision not to meet with the Islamic ambassadors in October.<br/>-<br/>-On [[December 20]] twenty-two former Danish ambassadors sent an open letter to the prime-minister criticising his decision not to open a dialogue with the international representatives.<ref>{{da icon}}{{citenews|date=[[2005-12-20]]|title=22 tidligere ambassadører siger fra|org=Politiken|url=http://politiken.dk/VisArtikel.iasp?PageID=425732}}</ref><br/>-<br/>-In early February, Swedish newspaper ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'' published an article that focused not on the cartoons but the cartoonists (who were not named). It was based on interviews with a few of the cartoonists, several of whom regretted creating the pictures. (Dagens Nyheter also noted that although the cartoons have received worldwide attention and have been published several times, the cartoonists have only earned the initial few hundred Danish kroner each for their work.)<br/>-<br/>-On [[February 4]] the newspaper ''[[Dagbladet Information]]'' published twelve [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen cartoons]] satirising his handling of the entire affair.<br/>-<br/>-=== Opinions of Muslims===<br/>-[[Image:Arabcartoon.jpg|thumb|right|310px| This cartoon from the [[Jordan]]ian newspaper ''Al Ghad'' <!--Needs date: very important!!--><br/>-expresses the fear of many Muslims that the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy exemplifies a perceived advancement of [[Islamophobia]] in the West. Clockwise: "This one is racist", "this one is anti-Semitic", "and this one (bottom) falls under freedom of speech"]]<br/>-A great many Muslims were angered by the publication of what they considered offensive images. This anger has been expressed in public protests, newspaper articles, emails, and [[Short message service|SMS]] messages in Arabic and Islamic countries. Although the artists have denied representing Mohammed as a terrorist, many Muslims felt that "a bomb in a turban, with a lit fuse and the Islamic creed written on the bomb" suggested a connection between Muhammad and terrorism. There are multiple ways to interpret this particular drawing though, for example that some Muslims are putting violence into the religion by using bombs, or that Islam is a bomb waiting to go off.<br/>-<br/>-Other Arabs and Muslims have expressed their condemnation of the cartoons: "In [the West] it is considered [[freedom of speech]] if they insult Islam and Muslims," columnist Mohammed al-Shaibani wrote in Kuwait's ''Al-Qabas'' daily on January 30. "But such freedom becomes racism and a breach of human rights and anti-Semitism if Arabs and Muslims criticize their religion and religious laws."<br/>-<br/>-A number of Muslim commentators, including Ehsan Ahrari of the ''[[Asia Times]]'', have pointed at laws in [[Germany]], [[France]], [[Austria]] and seven other countries in Europe which explicitly regard the [[Holocaust denial|denial of the Holocaust]] as a crime, free speech considerations notwithstanding. They maintain that offensive imagery regarding the [[Jewish]] religion and the Jewish people is largely prohibited in the media in post-[[Holocaust]] Europe. The media in general practices self-restraint in this matter; nonetheless, Muslims allege that a different set of standards seem to apply for the Islamic faith.<br/>-<br/>-In a [[BBC]] news programme, Asghar Bukhari of the British Muslim organization [[MPACUK]] and Roger Koeppel, editor of ''[[Die Welt]]'', the German newspaper that published the cartoons, debated the issue. Bukhari suggested to Koeppel that a German paper would be particularly mindful of the effect of such imagery, considering the lengthy history of [[Anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic propaganda]] and [[demonization]] of Jews in German media prior to the Holocaust, when [[caricature]]s of Jews as rich financiers or evil [[Bolsheviks]] were commonplace. Koeppel replied that he did not consider the caricatures of Muhammad in the same vein.<br/>-<br/>-The public anger was accompanied by a condemnation from Arabic and Islamic governments. The [[Muslim World League]] (MWL) called on [[United Nations Secretary-General|UN Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]] to activate international laws against insolence toward religion.<ref>[http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1566979/posts  freepublic.com]</ref><br/>-<br/>-[[Image:Dm_product.jpg|thumb|left|The [[boycott]] of Danish products.

"The repercussions of such irresponsible acts will have adverse impact on international relations." In [[Tunisia]], Abdulaziz Othman Altwaijri, president of the Islamic Organization for Education, Science and Culture (the Islamic world's counterpart to [[UNESCO]]) called the drawings "a form of racism and discrimination that one must counter by all available means." He said, "It's regrettable to state today, as we are calling for dialogue, that other parties feed animosity and hate and attack sacred symbols of Muslims and of their prophet," said  also Jordan's largest circulation daily, government-run Al-Rai, said the Danish government must apologize.<ref>{{citenews|date=[[2006-01-31]]|title=Outrage builds over Muhammad cartoons|org=Crisscross|url=http://www.crisscross.com/us/news/18287}}</ref><br/>-<br/>-The condemnations have also come from the General Secretariat of the Organization of Islamic Conference, saying:<br/>-:''It is evident that the intention of Jylland Posten was motivated to incite hatred and violence against Muslims.

As the reasoning goes, some seek to portray Muslims as enemies of Western values and incapable of integration in European society. At the same time various dictatorial regimes in the Islamic world seek to unite their populations behind them by creating external enemies, which they claim are attacking Islam.

Typically-cited examples of this alleged hypocrisy are bans on [[Holocaust denial]] (in effect in Germany, Austria, [[Switzerland]], and France) and [[hate speech]]. However, it should be noted that Western countries typically draw a sharp distinction between secular matters of race or humanist ethics and the purely religious.  (''See also [[Western culture]] and [[:Category:Religion and politics|Religion and politics]]''.)

It was derived from the earlier rifles, namely the Karabiner 98b which had itself been developed from the Mauser Model 1898. The [[Gewehr 98]] or Model 1898 took its principles from the [[Lebel Model 1886 rifle]] with the improvement of a metallic magazine of five [[cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]]s.  <br/>-<br/>-The rifle was noted for its good accuracy and effective range of up to 500 meters. For this reason it was also used with a telescopic sight as a [[sniper rifle]], which extended the effective range to about 800 m when used by a skilled [[marksman]]. The 98k had the same disadvantages as all other turn-of-the-century military rifles: being comparatively bulky and heavy, and the rate of fire was limited by how fast the bolt could be operated. <br/>-It was designed to be used with a [[bayonet]] and to fire rifle [[grenade]]s. A version with a folding stock was introduced in 1941 to be used by [[Airborne forces|airborne troops]].<br/>-<br/>-Since it was shorter than the earlier carbines, it was given the designation ''Karabiner 98 Kurz'', meaning Short [[Carbine]] Model 98. It was the standard rifle, though [[submachine gun]]s were often preferred, especially for urban combat where the rifle's range was not very useful. Towards the end of the war the Kar98k was being phased out in favor of the [[Sturmgewehr 44|MP44]], which fired a less powerful round but could be used like a submachine gun in close-quarters and urban fighting. Despite this, the Mauser Kar98k rifle was still produced and used in large quantities by the Germans during World War II, and the rifle was still an effective and potent infantry weapon in the final days of the war until Nazi Germany's surrender to the Allies in May 1945.<br/>-<br/>-==Combat use==<br/>-<br/>-===Post-World War II===<br/>-During [[World War II]], the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] captured millions of Mauser Kar98k rifles and re-arsenaled them in various arms factories in the late 1940s and early 1950s. <br/>-<br/>-One of the reasons behind the Soviets keeping these rifles after World War II was in case the Soviet Union was invaded again in a future war. The Soviets wanted to avoid the situation where they could be short of infantry weapons, as it happened during World War II when the Germans invaded the Soviet Union, especially when the [[Cold War]] started with the [[United States]] during this period of time. <br/>-<br/>-Another reason was that the Soviets wanted to support various [[communist]] [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] forces and newly-established communist governments around the world during the early [[Cold War]] period with a supply of cheap, surplus, military firearms like the Mauser Kar98k and the [[Mosin-Nagant]] series of rifles and carbines. The provision of firearms like the Mauser Kar98k and the Mosin-Nagant was one way that Moscow could support these organisations and governments until they trusted them enough to provide modern infantry weapons like the [[SKS]] carbine and the [[AK-47]] rifle.<br/>-<br/>-One example of the [[Soviet Union]] providing the Mauser Kar98k rifle (as well as other infantry weapons captured from the Germans during and after World War II) to its communist allies during the Cold War period occurred during the [[Vietnam War]] with the [[Soviet Union]] providing military aid to the armed forces of [[North Vietnam]] and to the [[Viet Cong]] in [[South Vietnam]].<br/>-<br/>-A considerable number of Soviet capture Mauser Kar98k rifles (as well as a number of Mauser Kar98k rifles that were left behind by the French after the [[First Indochina War]]) were found in the hands of [[Viet Cong]] guerrillas and [[North Vietnamese Army]] soldiers by US and Allied forces alongside Soviet-bloc rifles like the [[Mosin-Nagant]], the [[SKS]] and the [[AK-47]].<br/>-<br/>-In the years after [[World War II]], a number of European nations that were invaded and occupied by Nazi Germany used the Mauser Kar98k rifle as their standard-issue infantry rifle, due to the large numbers of German weapons that were left behind. Nations like [[France]] and [[Norway]] used the Mauser Kar98k rifle and a number of other German weapons in the years after World War 2. Firearms manufacturers like [[Fabrique Nationale]] in [[Belgium]], [[Česká zbrojovka]] (CZ) in [[Czechoslovakia]] and the [[Zastava]] plant in [[Kragujevac]], [[Serbia]], [[Yugoslavia]], continued to produce the Mauser Kar98k rifle after 1945. From 1950 to 1965, Zastava produced a near-identical copy of the Kar98k called the Model 1948 (M48) which differed only from the German rifle in that it had the shorter bolt-action of the [[Model 1924]] series of Mauser rifles. Yugoslavia sold many of these rifles to [[Algeria]], [[Egypt]] and [[Iran]] during the 1950s and '60s. Many surplus M48s have been sold in the [[United States]], [[Australia]] and [[Canada]] in recent years.<br/>-<br/>-===Israeli Mauser Kar98k rifle===<br/>-<br/>-A number of non-European nations used the Mauser Kar98k rifle as well as a few guerrilla organisations to help establish new nation-states. One example was [[Israel]] who used the Mauser Kar98k rifle from the late 1940s until the 1970s.<br/>-<br/>-The use of the Kar98k to establish the nation-state of [[Israel]] often raises a lot of interest among people and rifle collectors today with many Jewish organisations in [[Palestine (region) | Palestine]] acquiring them from post-war Europe to protect various Jewish settlements from [[Arab]] attack and to carry out [[guerrilla]] operations against [[British]] military forces in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. The use of this weapon, closely associated with [[Nazi Germany]] by early Israel is viewed with some irony, though in fact the National Socialist government actively supported Zionism during the 1930's.<br/>-<br/>-The [[Haganah]], who later evolved into the modern-day [[Israeli Defence Forces]], was one of the Jewish organisations in Palestine that brought large numbers of Mauser Kar98k rifles and other surplus arms (namely the [[Lee-Enfield]] bolt-action rifle) from Europe during the post-World War 2 period.<br/>- <br/>-The Israeli version of the Mauser Kar98k rifles differ from the original German version in that they have had all of the [[Nazi]] markings and emblems removed and replaced with [[Israeli Defence Force]] and [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] markings as part of an effort to ideologically "purify" the rifles from their former use as an infantry weapon of the armed forces of Nazi Germany. The Mauser Kar98k rifles produced by [[Fabrique Nationale]] post-[[World War II]] have [[Israeli Defence Force]] markings on the rifle as well as the emblem of the [[Israeli Defence Force]] on the top of the rifle's receiver. The FN-made Kar98k rifles with the IDF markings and emblem on the rifle were produced and sold to Israel after Israel established itself as an independent nation in 1948.<br/>-<br/>-During the late 1950s, the [[Israeli Defence Force]] converted the calibre of their Mauser Kar98k rifles from the original German [[8x57 IS |7.92 mm]] round to [[7.62 x 51 mm NATO |7.62 mm NATO]] after the Israeli Defence Force adopted the [[FN FAL]] rifle in 1958. The Israeli Mauser Kar98k rifles that were converted have "7.62" engraved on the rifle [[Receiver (firearms)|receiver]] and burned into the heel of the rifle stock for identification and to separate the re-chambered Kar98ks from the original 7.92 mm versions of the weapon that were still held by the Israelis.<br/>-<br/>-The Kar98k rifle was used by the reserve branches of the [[Israeli Defence Force]] well into the 1960s and 1970s and saw action in the hands of [[Israeli Army]] reservists during the  [[Six Day War | 1967 Six Day War]] and the  [[Yom Kippur War | 1973 Arab-Israeli War]].<br/>-<br/>-===Usage Today===<br/>-The Mauser Kar98k rifle, in all of its guises and origins, is very popular among many rifle shooters and gun [[collector]]s the world over. The Kar98k rifles that were used by Germany during World War II are highly sought after collector's items in many circles.<br/>-<br/>-The Israeli Mauser Kar98k rifle are popular with many rifle shooters and military rifle collectors due to the rifle's historical background as well as for the rifle's low recoil and the rifle's ability to use the [[7.62 mm NATO]] (.308 Winchester) round due to the low cost of commercial .308 Winchester ammunition and ex-military 7.62 mm NATO ammunition on the market today and the widespread use of the 7.62 mm NATO (.308 Winchester) round among target shooters and hunters alike.<br/>-<br/>-As of 2005, the Mauser Kar98k rifles that were captured by the Soviets during World War II and refurbished during the late 1940s and early 1950s have appeared in large numbers on the military [[surplus store|surplus]] rifle market. These have proven popular with buyers in the United States and Canada, ranging from ex-military rifle collectors to target shooters due to the unique history behind the Soviet capture of Mauser Kar98k rifles.<br/>-<br/>-The [[Bundeswehr]] still uses Kar98k rifles in the [[Wachbataillon]] for military parades and show acts.<br/>-<br/>-==External links==<br/>-'''German Mauser Kar98k rifle'''<br/>-*[http://www.mausershooters.org/k98k/start.html K98k Page]<br/>-*[http://www.cruffler.com/review-may-00.html cruffler.com]<br/>-*[http://world.guns.ru/rifle/rfl02-e.htm world.guns.ru]<br/>-*[http://www.surplusrifle.com/mauser98k/index.asp SurplusRifle.com]<br/>-*[http://www.sproe.com/k/karabiner-98k.html Saving Private Ryan Online Encyclopedia (contains a number of pictures of the Mauser Kar98k rifle from the movie)]<br/>-*[http://www.nazarian.no/wep.asp?id=24&group_id=3&country_id=101&lang=0&p=1 Nazarian's Gun Recognition Guide - Mauser Karabiner 98k rifle]<br/>-*[http://www.nazarian.no/wep.asp?id=24&group_id=3&country_id=101&lang=0&p=7 Nazarian's Gun Recognition Guide - Video of the Mauser Kar98k rifle in action]<br/>-<br/>-'''Israeli Mauser Kar98k rifle'''<br/>-<br/>-*[http://www.cruffler.com/review-January-01.html cruffler.com]<br/>-*[http://www.carbinesforcollectors.com/israeli.html Carbines For Collectors (contains a bit of history on the Mauser Kar98k rifle and its use by Israel)]<br/>-*[http://www.surplusrifle.com/shooting/oddshot4/index.asp SurplusRifle.com (contains information and history on the Mauser Kar98k rifle's use by Israel)]<br/>-<br/>-'''Yugoslav Mauser M48 rifle'''<br/>-<br/>-*[http://www.surplusrifle.com/yugom48/index.asp SurplusRifle.com]<br/>+This is a '''timeline of [[punk rock]]''', from its beginnings in the early [[1970s]] to the present time.<br/>+<br/>+==[[1964]]==<br/>+*Newly formed bands<br/>+**Motor City Five ([[MC5]])<br/>+<br/>+==[[1965]]==<br/>+*Newly formed bands<br/>+**[[Velvet Underground]]<br/>+<br/>+==[[1967]]==<br/>+*Newly formed bands<br/>+** [[The Stooges]]<br/>+<br/>+*Albums<br/>+** [[The Velvet Underground]] - ''[[The Velvet Underground and Nico]]''<br/>+<br/>+==[[1968]]==<br/>+*Albums<br/>+**[[The Velvet Underground]] - ''[[White Light/White Heat]]''<br/>+<br/>+==[[1969]]==<br/>+*Newly formed bands<br/>+**<br/>+<br/>+*Albums<br/>+** [[MC5]] - ''[[Kick Out the Jams]]''<br/>+** [[The Stooges]] - ''[[The Stooges (album)|The Stooges]]''<br/>+** [[The Velvet Underground]] - ''[[The Velvet Underground]]''<br/>+<br/>+==[[1970]]==<br/>+*Newly formed bands<br/>+<br/>+*Albums<br/>+** [[MC5]] - ''[[Back in the USA]]''<br/>+** [[The Stooges]] - ''[[Fun House]]''<br/>+<br/>+==[[1971]]==<br/>+*Newly formed bands<br/>+** [[New York Dolls]]<br/>+** [[Suicide (band)|Suicide]]<br/>+<br/>+*Albums<br/>+** [[MC5]] - ''[[High Time (album)|High Time]]''<br/>+<br/>+*Events<br/>+** Writer [[Dave Marsh]] uses the word "punk-rock" to describe the music of [[? and the Mysterians]]<br/>+<br/>+==[[1972]]==<br/>+* Newly formed bands<br/>+** [[The Saints]]<br/>+** The Strand (later became the [[Sex Pistols]])<br/>+<br/>+*Albums<br/>+**<br/>+<br/>+*Disbandments<br/>+**[[MC5]]<br/>+<br/>+*Events<br/>+** Original [[New York Dolls]] drummer [[Billy Murcia]] dies of alcohol poisoning while the band is touring London and is replaced with [[Jerry Nolan]].<br/>+<br/>+==[[1973]]==<br/>+* Newly formed bands<br/>+** [[Television (band)|Television]]<br/>+<br/>+*Albums<br/>+** [[New York Dolls]] - ''[[New York Dolls (album)|New York Dolls]]''<br/>+** [[The Stooges]] - ''[[Raw Power]]''<br/>+** [[Neon Boys]] - ''[[Neon Boys (album)|Neon Boys]]'' 7"<br/>+<br/>+==[[1974]]==<br/>+* Newly formed bands<br/>+** [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]<br/>+** [[The Dictators]]<br/>+** [[Pere Ubu (band)|Pere Ubu]]<br/>+** [[The Ramones]]<br/>+** [[The Stranglers]]<br/>+** [[Talking Heads]]<br/>+** [[Radio Birdman]]<br/>+<br/>+*Albums<br/>+** [[New York Dolls]] - ''[[Too Much Too Soon]]''<br/>+<br/>+*Disbandments<br/>+** [[The Stooges]]<br/>+<br/>+*Events<br/>+**[[Television]] start performing at the [[CBGB]] club in New York's [[Greenwich Village]]<br/>+<br/>+==[[1975]]==<br/>+* Newly formed bands<br/>+** [[The Adicts]]<br/>+** [[The Boomtown Rats]]<br/>+** [[The Heartbreakers (band)|The Heartbreakers]]<br/>+** [[The Undertones]]<br/>+<br/>+*Albums<br/>+** [[The Dictators|Dictators]] - ''[[Go Girl Crazy!]]''<br/>+** [[Patti Smith]] - ''[[Horses (album)|Horses]]''<br/>+<br/>+*Disbandments<br/>+** [[New York Dolls]]<br/>+<br/>+* Events<br/>+**  [[Television (band)|Television]] records a demo tape for [[Island Records]] with [[Brian Eno]], but the label decides not to sign the band.

Anselm held the post for fifteen years, and then, in 1078, on the death of Herlwin, the warrior monk who had founded the monastery, he was made abbot. Under his rule Bec became a famous seat of learning, and there Anselm wrote his first philosophical works, the dialogues on Truth and Free Will, and the two famous treatises, the Monologion and Proslogion.<br/>+== Cunningham family ==<br/>+*[[Liz Stooke]] - (Angela Cunningham)<br/>+*[[Stephanie Waring]] - (Cindy Cunningham)<br/>+*[[Lisa Williamson]] - (Dawn Cunningham)<br/>+*[[Bernard Latham]] - (Gordon Cunningham)<br/>+*[[Kathryn George]] - (Helen Cunningham)<br/>+*[[Davinia Taylor]] - (Jude Cunningham)<br/> <br/>-Seeing to the monastery's properties and affairs in England Anselm became known there and was looked on as a natural successor to Lanfranc as Archbishop of Canterbury. But on the death of the great archbishop, King William Rufus held the possessions and revenues of the see, as was his right during a vacancy, but made no new appointment. About four years later, in 1092, on the invitation of Hugh, Earl of Chester, Anselm with some reluctance, for he feared to be made archbishop, crossed to England. He was detained by business for several months, and when about to return to Normandy, was refused permission by the king. In the following year William fell ill, and thought death was at hand. Eager to make atonement for his sin with regard to the archbishopric, he nominated Anselm to the vacant see, and compelled him to accept the pastoral staff of office. After obtaining dispensation from duties in Normandy, Anselm was consecrated in 1093.<br/>+== Davies family ==<br/>+*[[Helen Noble]] - (Abby Davies)<br/>+*[[Marcus Patric]] - (Ben Davies)<br/>+*[[Elize Du Toit]] - (Izzy Cornwell/Davies)<br/>+*[[Barney Cleverly]] - (Will Davies)<br/> <br/>-Anselm's tenure was fraught with tensions with the King.<br/>-----<br/>+== Dean family ==<br/>+*[[Jodi Albert]] - (Debbie Dean)<br/>+*[[Colin Wells]] - (Johnno Dean)<br/> <br/>-I've added back alot of the content from the above that was removed.

It requires readers to know in advance more or less the detail of the Investiture controversy, i think. for instance, why did pope Paschal exclude henry I in excommunicating kings and nobles? And therere some wrong or at least unconfirmed facts in his bio: some sources (i forgot which) say that he left home in 1057 instead of 1059, and Hopkins's ''Anselm of Canterbury'', which you can read online, says it's 1056. and according to my Britannica 2003, he finished ''Cur Deus Homo?'' in "the village of Liberi, near Capua". I also found some others contradictory to either my Britannica or Standford Encyclopedia.<br/>-<br/>-And his WRitings. I'm not a native English user, so some of my claims would be misleading. But if you look through it, youll easily find some obvious grammatical mistakes (and i don't point out which to natives). The first paragraph is too long and with grammatical mistakes makes reaading hard. YOu'll see it in the second sentence (and who is 'a schoolman' in that sentence?) And as DOric Loon says in the above, some are reiterated over and over again (especially in Cur Deus Homo arg). So 'what's the point?' goes. i think it might be convenient to divide into two - philsophical and theological influences of his. Anselm's ontological argument about the existence of GOd is highly regarded i the field of philosophy, while the other, the satisfaction theory part is not. (though I know its hard).

[[User:KarlBunker|KarlBunker]] 02:43, 15 January 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-==General Issues on this Article & 'Dilecto Dilectori'==<br/>-<br/>-I was invited to post my comments on this article by a number of Wikipedia users, who have general concerns about the Scholarly Accuracy and Methodoloy of Editing this article since its inception. I have breifly reviewed the history and think it is about time there be a proposal about proceedure.  Karl Bunker has done a lot of editing recently. I think that most of it is good. I would ask that he add back to the article the citations to major works about Anselm, even if they are old, because, nevertheless they are important historical contributions to Anselmian research. But more importantly, there must be some consensus of how to edit this article. Every deletion certainly is not vandalism, and every addition is certainly not not vandalism. The rule should be historical accuracy. To detriment this accuracy is either an error, when there is no malice, or vandalism if there is malice. To improse this accuracy is what we all want, whether that requires removing or adding text or correcting text.<br/>-<br/>-But as regards the Dilecto Dilectori controversy between Karl Bunker and an anonymous editor, I would point out that there are solid reasons why this section should be moved to an article on the Gay Movement's Historical Arguments or the Gay Movement Revisionist Strategies.<br/>-<br/>-You can see my arguments with links to support this at<br/>-<br/>-http://www.franciscan-archive.org/misc/slurr.html<br/>-<br/>-I will not post a correction to the Anselm Article until there is some concensus. Because I am convinced the Section on Dilecto Dilectori is not appropriate in its present format, nor the Dobbins link, to the historical Anselm of Canterbury. [[User:Br Alexis Bugnolo|Br Alexis Bugnolo]] 18:34, 5 February 2006 (EDST)<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-: Br. Bugnolo -- I'm happy to discuss this with you, and I have carefully read your linked arguments. When the deletion-edits you mention took place, there was no attempt at discussion, much less an attempt at consensus, on the deleter's part, and so the edits were treated as vandalism.<br/>-: As you've noted, I've done a fair amount of editing on this article, although most of this has been in the nature of cleaning up, reformatting and clarifying other people's writing. In particular, I am not the original author of the 'Dilecto Dilectori' section. I'm very fond of this article, and therefor I tend to keep an eye on it and its discussion page.<br/>-<br/>-: Regarding the 'Dilecto Dilectori' passage: One problem that you and I may have in discussing this is that, unfortunately, we have some markedly different values on one pertinent issue. To me (and I'm sure, to many people reading this article) the phrase "charges of homosexuality" is a meaningless and anachronistic phrase; one cannot be "charged" with something that carries no connotations of wrongdoing. I realize that this isn't your view, and that you consider homosexuality to be a "slur." I won't argue with you there, but I'm afraid that this viewpoint is causing you to misread this section of the article. With that in mind, allow me to go over the content of the section:<br/>-: * It mentions that there has been a debate about Anselm's sexual orientation.<br/>-: * It sites one author  as being among the "some secular historians" who "take Anselm's homosexuality as a matter of course". It never states that it is a widely accepted that Anselm was a homosexual; it merely states that the issue has been raised by some.<br/>-: * It makes no claim, and makes no mention of any author making the claim, that Anselm engaged in homosexual sex. It specifically refers to "the passionate expressions of attachment in his poems" as happening "within the constraints of monastic celibacy." <br/>-: * It states ''twice'', using different phrasing, that it is a mistake for "stereotypes of modern sexuality [to be] anachronistically projected upon the past."<br/>-<br/>-: This last point is the reason why I am particularly fond of this section of the article. It makes a point, with wonderful conciseness and clarity, that I feel is far too often overlooked: That certain types of "passionate expressions of attachment" by historical figures "have no modern parallels."<br/>-<br/>-: It is a fact that there has been some debate about Anselm's sexuality, and the article reports this fact. What I earnestly beg you to try to do is to see the reality of what ''else'' this section of the article does: After it makes mention of the debate, it then resoundingly, unequivocally, dismisses it as irrelevant. I can't think of anything I've read recently that so neatly quashes the attitude of twittery, gossipy finger-pointing that often accompanies speculation about the sexual orientation of a historical figure. I feel that this section of the article does a service Saint Anselm, and to the study of history as well. <br/>-: [[User:KarlBunker|KarlBunker]] 01:23, 6 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-: Regarding the "References" section, I invite you to put back any of those 19th century references that you think are appropriate. Adding modern reference works would be even better. [[User:KarlBunker|KarlBunker]] 03:32, 6 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-O.K. I will add them all back.  As for the anonymous, he contacted me, pointing out that he did his edits without familiarizing himself with Wikipedia etiquette, and did not intend vandalism.<br/>-<br/>-As an Anthropologist, I find the claim that the expression of affection in Anselms poems has no modern parallels, extremely uniformed. If it means what it seems to mean, then it means that no men today, write letters to other men with similar expressions. I am sure that I do not have to give examples, to show that my conclusion on this point is valid. Suffice it to say, that if there is any homosexual today who writes letters to his male lover, using similar terms OR if there is any father who writes letters to an errant son, using similar terms of affection, then this claim would be false.  I find the precise terminology used in this claim, unintelligible, and not worthy of a scholarly remark.<br/>-<br/>-As a college graduate, I do not think an article by an undergraduate, presumably in Art History(Dobbins) has any merit in a Encyclopedia article on a Scholastic Theologian, regardless of anyone's interest to support or rebut its conclusions, as that rather belongs in a blog, or personal web page, not an Encyclopedia article. As to the link on Dobbins, it belongs in an article on Historical Revisionism. Readers of the Anselms article undoubtedly want to learn about the historic Anselm, not about what some modern movement thinks about his sexuality.  I would point out that Dobbins does not cite, as far as I can discover any reputable historian or scholar to support his assertions. It is only an undergraduate puff piece that suited his fancy or that of his proff.<br/>-<br/>-The citation I made to Fr. Adrian Bulter's Live of the Saints, about the letters of St. Anselm, is a very important one, for Fr. Butler's work was a summary of the articles of the Bollandists on the lives of Saints.  The Bollandists are a group of Jesuit scholars who for the past 400 years have investigated every historical fact or claim about each saint and published 10,000's pages of research in a work called the Acta Sanctorum.<br/>-<br/>-As for the Cantor citation, another Wikipedia user is going to buy the book today, and hopefully will post his thoughts on the citation shortly.<br/>-<br/>-As for your explanation that the 'Dilecto Dilectori' section debunks the claim: I must admit that the context and text does not convey that to me. I think if that was your intention, it was too subtle a one to be recognized as such by most readers of the article.--[[User:Br Alexis Bugnolo|Br Alexis Bugnolo]] 11:56, 6 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-: Br. Bugnolo --<br/>-: First, I was not saying that the  'Dilecto Dilectori' section "debunked" the notion that Anselm was homosexual. I said that it dismisses the assertion as irrelevant.<br/>-<br/>-: I'm puzzled by your objection to the Dobbins article. I don't see what "assertions" it makes that you think should be better supported, nor do I understand why you would argue against a reference to this article. I can only conclude that your expectations have lead you to misread Dobbins' article. At no point does Dobbins assert that Anselm was a homosexual. At no point does he even state that Anselm was "probably" homosexual. Basically, he says only two things: <br/>-: *That a contemporary reader might see some of Anselm's poetry as being expressions of homoerotic passion.<br/>-: *That to do this is a misguided and anachronistic projection of modern attitudes into a time and culture where they don't apply. <br/>-: To quote from Dobbins' article: "we cannot assume, no matter how sexual the language may seem to modern readers, that the intended recipient of the poem would also read a sexual meaning into the text." In short, Dobbins is on your side.<br/>-<br/>-: I agree that "passionate expressions of attachment" by historical figures "have no modern parallels" may be worded with too much finality. However, I see the statement as being about the feelings expressed, rather than about the words used to express them. Taken this way, it's a statement that can't be proven or disproven. In any case, the purpose of the statement is the same as the purpose of Dobbins' article: to warn against simplistically applying modern sexual attitudes to one's reading of Anselm's "passionate" writings. As such, the "no modern parallels" phrase is, like the Dobbins article, something that reflects opinions you yourself have expressed in this issue. [[User:KarlBunker|KarlBunker]] 15:46, 6 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-Dobbins is subtle, but in no way neutral on the matter: he says, "''On the other hand, some of his poetry sounds downright erotic, no matter what Neoplatonic interpretation one applies''", and again "''Anselm, prior of Bec and later Archbishop of Canterbury, was one of the most influential proponents of the ideal of monastic love in the England of his day. This was truly a synthesis of the sexual with Platonic''", and again, "''he celebrated his love for his fellow monks in poem after poem''" (It certainly is not a celebration of love, because he in no way praises love, only expresses the sadness of absence and the joy of presence of his brother monk).<br/>-<br/>-For these reasons, I believe the only correct textual interpretation of Dobbins article is to favor these poems as sexual, not merely expressions of fraternal or paternal affection. Infact I see no treatment of the latter two as possibilities, despite the wording of his conclusion. If he pooh poohs moderns for their preconceptions, he would have done better not to impose the same kind of his own. In short, even if you hold that his article does not favor this allegation, it is nevertheless not an article worth quoting in a Encyclopedia, it is amateurish and inconsistent.<br/>-<br/>-In short, to cite it in the Anselm article, when Anselm is by far one of the most influential of thinkers in the history of western Europe, makes this wikipedia article seem similary amateurish and unprofessional. Silence is the best treatment for articles such as Dobbins in an Encyclopedia.--[[User:Br Alexis Bugnolo|Br Alexis Bugnolo]] 17:36, 6 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-: There is no requirement that Dobbins be neutral, as his article is a sited source, not an encyclopedia article. However, when he makes the statement that some of Anselm's poems "sound downright erotic," he ''is'' being neutral, inasmuch as stating the obvious is neutral. The quoted passages in the his article bear this out. Note he does not say they ''are'' erotic; only that they ''sound'' that way to modern ears.<br/>-<br/>-: In your second paragraph you state that the only correct interpretation of Dobbins' article is the one you choose to impose on it. I submit that an interpretation of a text that ignores the conclusion of that text is not a valid interpretation. You are having difficulty seeing past the fact that Dobbins mentions the fact of speculation around Anselm's sexuality, mentions the sources of that speculation in Anselm's writings, and that he doesn't flatly and rigidly deny any possibility that Anselm had feelings of a homosexual nature. Because you find these things offensive, you are focussing on them rather than on the conclusions that Dobbins draws. He is defending a point of view you basically agree with, but he isn't using language that you approve of while he does it. He acknowledges certain obvious realities and incorporates them into his argument; you would prefer that he deny those realities. I would point out that arguments that deny obvious realities are generally rather unconvincing arguments.<br/>- <br/>-: You are doing a similar thing with the 'Dilecto Dilectori' section of the Wikipedia article: It mentions an idea that you find offensive, and this blinds you to the simple fact that the idea is very briefly mentioned and then essentially dismissed as irrelevant.<br/>-<br/>-: I'm sure it would be preferable to you for there to be no mention of any speculation around Anselm's sexuality. However, that speculation exists; Anselm's own writings invite it. Short of censoring that fact out of this article, articles like Dobbins' are the best "defense" that you can hope for. [[User:KarlBunker|KarlBunker]] 18:35, 6 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-Karl, your argument is circular: first you say I am imposing an interpretation and then that Dobbins is the best defense I can hope for. It is Dobbins, an undergraduate in 2001, who raises the issue in an undergraduate paper, to rebut, as you say, what a homosexual activist said back in 1908. O.K. What does that have to do with a Wikipedia article in 2006? And why does a passing remark of Nicholas Cantor have to do with an encyclopedia article? It is rather Wetman who raised the issue, a self proclaimed intellectual non-conformist. If you are not Wetman, then I see no purpose to your insistence that what he added, that is, this entire section 'dilecto dilectori' and the Dobbins citation, be retained. I believe I have shown that objectively speaking, NPOV, there is no scholarly basis for the charge in the first place. As to what an uninformed reader, reading a English translation of Latin or of a French translation of the Latin, thinks about Anselm's sexuality, what does that have to do with an encylopedia article? Should he not first read a biography about Anselm, and if a scholar at least consider what has already been addressed by the Bollandists in the Acta Sanctorum.  You know, as a Catholic, Anselm is probably better known among cathlolic scholars than elsewhere.<br/>-<br/>-You are entitled to your personal preferences, but does every reader of an article on one of the most important thinkers of Western Civilization have to be imposed upon by them? You are trying to relevatize my argument, when in fact it is you who hold the relativist position, that homosexuality is not as the vast majority of humany considers it a moral deviation and a slur against the good name of any man. I scarcely can see how it would be honest, charitable, or friendly if someone posted a Wikipedia article about yourself, and dismissed similarly unbased accusations against you. That sort of this is obvious for what it is, a journalistic game (just as Wetman admits Wikipedia is a game to himself) rather than a service of truth and the honor due the good name of any man.<br/>-<br/>-Finally, this man, Anselm, is one of the greatest saints and doctors in the Catholic Church; the inclusion of any unsubstantiated or unscholarly charge against him, even to dismiss it, profoundly offends the religious sensibilities of Catholics: for as St. Paul says, "of such things let them not even be heard among you". Since '''the charge is, as you admit, based on modern preconceptions not historical realities''', then at least for the respect anyone should have for the religiuos sensibilities of others, would agree that it ought to be omitted?  --[[User:Br Alexis Bugnolo|Br Alexis Bugnolo]] 22:35, 6 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-===Question About Dobbins===<br/>-I have a question about the Dobbins article that is related to whether it is deserving of mention.  Is it the only similar modern article making the homosexuality argument, in which case it should be excluded as simply an isolated paper?  Or is it an example of a school of modern scholarship that takes a similar view?  In the latter case, as much as I disagree, I would think that a one-sentence or two-sentence mention of this POV is in order.  Does Dobbins refer to other reputable modern scholars for confirmation?  [[User:Robert McClenon|Robert McClenon]] 19:04, 6 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-: Dobbins does not "make the homosexuality argument." That is, he does not say Anselm was or probably was homosexual. He notes that readers of some of Anselm's poems will inevitably speculate on that question, and goes on from there. Some excerpts of Anselm poems are included in the Dobbins article. Other authors, as mentioned in the WK article, have mentioned or engaged in the speculation. [[User:KarlBunker|KarlBunker]] 19:35, 6 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-::What is the WK article?  [[User:Robert McClenon|Robert McClenon]] 20:01, 6 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-: Sorry; I meant the Wikipedia article ([[Anselm of Canterbury]]). [[User:KarlBunker|KarlBunker]] 20:32, 6 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-Correction, Karl says other authors mentioned in the Anselm article: there is only 1 other author mentioned, Cantor. --[[User:Br Alexis Bugnolo|Br Alexis Bugnolo]] 22:35, 6 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-:I just read the Dobbins paper.  I see no reason to mention it.  It hardly supports any particular argument about Anselm's sexuality, but only that there has been such speculation.  I fail to see the point to saying that Dobbins does not answer a question.  The real question is whether the question needs to be mentioned at all.  Cantor is a highly regarded source, but he is only one scholar.  Have any other respected scholars discussed Anselm's sexuality, and in what context?  As Anselm scholarship, as medieval scholarship in general, or as modern gender studies scholarship?  [[User:Robert McClenon|Robert McClenon]] 23:13, 6 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-: As Br. Bugnolo notes, only one other author besides Dobbins is mentioned in the Wikipedia article. Here are a few others. This is a partial list, compiled through a 1-hour google search, and is '''exclusively''' authors and scholars who have voiced the opinion that Anselm '''was''' gay. The list of authors who have merely discussed the possibility is, of course, much longer. Since Dobbins is a member of this longer list, I am hoping it will be possible to find an article that makes the same point that his does, but written by someone with more scholarly qualifications.<br/>-<br/>-:* Dr. John Balnaves, in his doctoral thesis, Australian National University<br/>-<br/>-:* Rictor Norton, author of 4 books and several articles on history<br/>-<br/>-:* Dr. Paul Halsall, Medieval historian, Brooklyn University<br/>-<br/>-:* John Boswell, historian, author of many books, including "Christianity, Social Tolerance and Homosexuality"<br/>-<br/>-:* Dr. Brian McGuire, author of "Love, Friendship and Sex in the 11th Century: The Experience of Anselm" . Although he took no stand on the issue of Anselm's homosexuality in the book just named, more recently he has argued that it is "appropriate" to see Anselm as homosexual. (McGuire, Brian P., "Monastic Friendship and Toleration in Twelfth Century Cistercian Life")<br/>-<br/>-: Just so no one is confused by my giving this list: The Wikipedia article does not claim that Anselm was a homosexual, and I'm not arguing that it should. This list serves as a small indication that a debate on the issue exists. [[User:KarlBunker|KarlBunker]] 00:25, 7 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-Karl, the work by McGuire is not a book; it was an article in a journal. You can see that from his homepage, linked from the argument I prosed in my intial post on this discussion board above. Now, that you have looked into the literature, you need to do what any graduate student should do, check out the footnotes in all of thes articles.  I submit, that you will find that they all tract back to Carpenter, one way or another, and represent only a study of the modern Homosexual Revisionism Movement, and have nothing to do with historical studies per se.<br/>-<br/>-But since you have not read the litterature, you should admit that you and Wetman have no ground yet to include this 'Dilecto dilectori' section and the Dobbins link in the Anselm article, as you yourself admit to be unfamiliar with the matter, you can scarcely impose your preliminary interest upon all those using the Wikipedia article on Anselm.<br/>-<br/>-'''I, therefore, formally request, that this discussion regarding the inclusion of the Dilecto Dilectori section and the Dobbins link move''' from the phase regarding the determination of the burden of proof for its existence to the burden of proof for its presence; '''and that until that latter has been proven, these elements be removed from the Anselm Article.'''<br/>-<br/>---[[User:Br Alexis Bugnolo|Br Alexis Bugnolo]] 00:36, 7 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-: Br. Bugnolo -- My sense is that this debate is winding down. You're no longer answering my arguments with counter-arguments, but instead are falling back on non-arguments such as telling me that homosexuality is a moral deviation. Also, we're both getting impatient and I suspect are close to resorting to insults. :-)<br/>-: I propose the following: At the least, I think the section could validly be edited to remove the phrase that "some secular historians take Anselm's homosexuality as a matter of course." Furthermore, as I note above, it should be possible to find a citable source that makes the point that Dobbins makes (that modern stereotype about sexuality shouldn't be indiscriminately projected onto the past--a point which I believe you agree with), but written by someone with more scholarly credentials.<br/>-: I'll give this some more thought and do some more reading over the next few days and then post an edit. It may even be that the result of my thoughts might be to agree that the section isn't important enough to warrant inclusion. (Of course if that happens, it's entirely possible some other person will see fit to put the section back.) If you still don't agree with whatever changes I make, you can apparently put in a [[Wikipedia:Arbitration policy|request for arbitration]].<br/>-: It's been a pleasure debating this with you; thanks. [[User:KarlBunker|KarlBunker]] 01:09, 7 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-::It is not time for a [[Wikipedia:Arbitration policy|request for arbitration]].  Those are not used to resolve content disputes.  They are used to resolve user conduct disputes.  I did not see any user conduct problem, but two editors with different points of view (POVs) who treated each other with respect.  It has indeed been a pleasure in this content dispute with two Wikipedians who actually treat each other with cvility and respect and believe in [[WP:NPOV|the non-negotiable and absolute principle of a neutral point of view]].

[[User:Robert McClenon|Robert McClenon]] 01:43, 7 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-== What Cantor actually wrote ==<br/>-<br/>-This dispute could have been avoided with a little honesty.  Here's what Cantor actually wrote in '''In the Wake of the Plague''' ISBN 0684857359<br/>-<blockquote><br/>-:The last front-rank philosopher and theologian who had been Archbishop of Canterbury was St. Anslem in the east years of the twelfth century.  He did poorly as archbishop, getting into needless quarrels with kings, exasperating the pope, and turning the monks into an ingroup of young gays.<br/>-</blockquote><br/>-<br/>-In another book, writing about another saint, Archbishop [[Thomas Becket]], Cantor wrote:<br/>-<blockquote><br/>-:If he could have had a dose of [[Lithium salt|Lithium]] each morning, there might have been no Canterbury martyr.  (Cantor, Inventing the Middle Ages, p. 366)<br/>-</blockquote><br/>-<br/>-I've read many books by Professor Norman Cantor, and he is a serious historian for the most part, but ITWOTP is a popular and not a scholarly history and there are no footnotes to back up the assertion made here.  It is too casual to be cited in the Wikipedia article.<br/>-<br/>-Cantor mentions St. Anslem in his criticism of the scholarship of Professor [[Richard Southern]] of [[Oxford University]] where, in 1953, Cantor became Southern's student and each thought himself to be the greatest living expert on the subject of St. Anslem.  The way I read pages 343 through 370 of '''Inventing the Middle Ages''' ISBN 0688123023, is that Cantor abandoned objectivity generally about this period and especially so with respect to St. Anslem making him a special target of his contempt.<br/>-<br/>-If there is a serious and non-speculative historical claim to St. Anslem being homosexual, it can be in the article. ''But'' Cantor's biased and flippant "ingroup of young gays" comment appears to me to be a slap back at his rival [[historian|medievalists]] for admiring St. Anslem rather than scholarship.

He has been vocal in his criticism of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|American invasion of Iraq]], and in particular the profiteering of [[Halliburton]], with its close connections with [[Dick Cheney]].<br/>-<br/>-During a visit to Australia, [[Australian Security Intelligence Organisation|ASIO]] requested an interview with Scott, which he declined after being advised that it was not compulsory. He was detained by Federal police on [[10 September]] [[2005]] and kept in solitary confinement in a [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] prison until he was forcibly deported on the [[15 September|15th]] on the grounds that he is "a threat to national security", although no further details have been given by ASIO either to Scott Parkin or the public. [[The Australian]] newspaper reported that sources alleged Scott Parkin may have intended to advocate techniques such as throwing marbles underneath police horses, but Scott denied he would ever encourage such behaviour. A subsequent report issued on December 6 (see below) by the Inspector-General or Intelligence Services said that these claims were "not a reliable guide to the ASIO assessment".<br/>-<br/>-Despite the lack of details being provided by ASIO, it has been suggested that Scott Parkin may have been deported to test the Australian public's reaction to anti-terror laws being introduced around the same time as the deportation, a claim that has been denied by Australian [[Attorney-General]] [[Philip Ruddock]]. Australian newspaper [[The Age]] claims that techniques Scott Parkin was teaching in workshops while in Australia were what led to his deportation. The subsequent appeal process will test the powers of the Attorney-General under the National Security Information Act, which has been suggested as another possible motivation for his deportation.<br/>-<br/>-Scott Parkin has not been charged with any offense. However, he has been charged almost AUD$11,700 for the cost of his detention, the flight back to the US for himself and two Australian Government escorts and their accommodation in Los Angeles for 4 nights (15th September - 19th September). He had not been charged for breaking any laws while in Australia. His visa was cancelled immediately by the ''Department of Immigration'' following advice of an ''adverse security assessment'' by ASIO, which led to his automatic detainment under the Migration Act, and subsequent deportation. Under the Migration Act his detention was at his own expense, as was his removal. While the nature of the claims against him remain unknown, Parkin has defended himself claiming to be a peaceful activist, not involved in violent activity, and not to have advocated the use of violence.<br/>-<br/>-Scott Parkin’s barrister is [[Julian Burnside]], [[Queen's Counsel|QC]]. In an interview on [[Radio National]], Burnside said it may be difficult to appeal the adverse security assessment, and showed concern for the degradation of [[due process]] and [[Transparency (humanities)|transparency]]:<br/>-<br/>-:The difficulty that confronts us, potentially, is that the Attorney-General has got power under the National Security Information Act to certify conclusively that revealing the contents of the report would adversely affect Australia’s national security interests. And if he certifies that, then any court hearing our challenge will have to hold a private hearing in which the court considers whether or not to allow the evidence to be produced in court. And in that process the statute directs the Judge to give primary weight to the conclusive certificate of the Attorney, which looks (and it’s never been tested) but it looks as though it gives him the chance to stymie the process of examining the basis for the report.<br/>-<br/>-Mr Parkin, a native of Houston, Texas, USA, participated in an anti-war profiteering protest outside Halliburton in Sydney on August 31, and was also reported to have attended the [[2005 Forbes Global CEO Conference]] protest.

I am writing to you because you voted "keep" in AfD for aetherometry entry.  The present situation is that by Wikipedia standards there is no reputable secondary literature at all about aetherometry.  The minority view is contained only in primary sources, which do not even fulfill Wikipedia standards for scientific references, and there are no other publications, so there is no majority view.  "Majority view" here does not mean view of majority of Wikipedia administrators, it means published and generally accepted view of outside scientific community.  There is nothing like this for aetherometry.  As result,  nothing in entry can be verified or referenced, it is all interpretation and opinion.  This is not how encyclopedia should work, and is against Wikipedia policy.  Since you said that entry should be kept, you must have idea how entry can start to provide verifiable encyclopedic information when there are no existing secondary sources.  How can this problem be solved?  I think you cannot just say "keep" and leave to others dealing with this problem, which to me seems completely not solvable.  Please, describe what your solution is, and how you will personally help make aetherometry entry honest, reputable and verifiable.  Sincerely, Janusz.

Medieval sources traditionally describe them as Bulgarians, a definition which survived well into the period of Ottoman rule as attested by the Ottoman archives and by descriptions of historians and travellers, for example [[Evliya Celebi]] and his ''Book of Travels''.<br/>+<br/>+In the late [[19th century]] and the beginning of [[20th century]], there were lot of clashes of Serbophile Chetniks (originating from Macedonia) and Bulgarophile Komitas all over the Slavic-speaking Macedonia, which shows the lack of their proper national feeling.<br/>+During the Turkish rule, the Macedonians had little or no political and national identity of their own until the [[20th century]]. <br/>+<br/>+[[19th century]] ethnographers and travellers were generally united in identifying them as Bulgarians until the period between [[1878]] and [[1912]] when the rival propaganda machines of Serbia, Greece and Bulgaria succeeded in effectively splitting the Slavophone population of Macedonia into three distinct parties, a pro-Serbian, pro-Greek and pro-Bulgarian one ([http://knigite.abv.bg/en/hb/index.html Henry Brailsford]).<br/>+<br/>+The key events in the formation of a distinctive "Macedonian" identity thus came during the first half of the 20th century in the aftermath of the [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912-1913 and especially following the [[Second World War]].<br/>+<br/>+==The Balkan Wars==<br/>+The Balkan Wars resulted in drastic changes to Macedonia's demographics after the Ottomans were forced out of the region. Ottoman Macedonia was carved up between the Balkan nations, with its northern parts coming under Serbian rule, the southern under Greece and the northeastern under Bulgaria. <br/>+<br/>+The territory of the present-day Republic of Macedonia came under the direct rule of Serbia (and later the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]), and was sometimes termed "southern Serbia", and it officially, together with a large portion of today's southern Serbia, belonged to the newly formed Vardar banovina (district). An intense programme of "Serbianization" was implemented during the [[1920s]] and [[1930s]], during which time the local population were forcibly assimilated into Serbian culture. Between the world wars in Serbia Macedonian dialects was treated as a Serbian dialects (UCLA Language Material Sources, [[http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/]]). Only the literary [[Serbian language]] was taught, it was the language of education, media, and public life; even so Macedonian literature was tolerated as a local dialectal folkloristic form. Serbian National Theatre in Skopje even performed some of the Macedonian language plays (now the classical drama pieces) (UCLA Language Material Sources, [[http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/]]).<br/>+<br/>+Greece adopted strongly repressive policies towards the Slavic population in its northern regions, mainly due to Bulgaria's expantionist policy during the [[Second Balkan War]]. Those that inhabited northeastern Greece fled to Bulgaria or Serbia after the [[Balkan wars]] or were exchanged with Greeks from Bulgaria under a population exchange treaty in the [[1920s]]{{fact}}. <br/>+<br/>+The Slavophones that stayed in northwestern Greece were regarded as a potentially disloyal "Bulgarian minority" and came under severe pressure, with restrictions on their movements, cultural activities and political rights; as a result many emigrated, for the most part to [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[USA]] and eastern European countries like Bulgaria.{{fact}} A number of Macedonian Slavic and Turkish place names and Slavic personal surnames were renamed during this period (eg. Lerin becoming [[Florina]], Nachev becoming Natsulis [http://www.hrw.org/reports/pdfs/g/greece/greece945.pdf])  This was a government sponsored process of Hellenization.[http://www.hrw.org/reports/pdfs/g/greece/greece945.pdf] Many of the border villages were closed to outsiders, ostensibly for security reasons. The Greek government and people have never recognized the existence of a "Macedonian" ethnic group, as the term "Macedonian" is already reserved for the ethnic Greek population that has traditionally inhabited Greece's northern-most region ([[Macedonia (Greece)]]).<br/>+<br/>+On August 10, 1920, upon signing the Treaty of Sevres to protect its national minorities, the [[Image:Abecedar2.jpg|250px|thumb|right|ABECEDAR school book]] Greek government notified the [[League of Nations]] that ''"measures were being taken towards the opening of schools with instruction in the Slav language in the following school year of 1925/26"''. Thus, the primer intended for the Macedonian children in Greek Macedonia to learn their native language in school, entitled "ABECEDAR" [http://www.mymacedonia.net/aegean/hellenization.htm],  [http://www.gate.net/~mango/GR_evidence_H_Andonovski.htm] [http://www.makedonika.org/ABECEDAR.htm] was offered as an argument in support of this statement. This primer, prepared by a special government commissioner was published by the Greek government in Athens in 1925, but was printed in a specially adapted Latin alphabet instead of the traditional [[Cyrillic]], since Cyrillic was the official alphabet of neighboring Bulgaria and Serbia. The book was to be held up as proof that a Macedonian Slavic tongue exhisted and that it was neither Bulgarian nor Serbian, but a distinct language protected and encouraged by the State. This would mean that the Greek government officially recognized for the first time a separate national entity of the Macedonians within Greece. But after fears from Serbia and Bulgaria that the Macedonians in their borders might demand the same rights, the Abecedar school books were confiscated and destroyed before it got into the reach of the children [http://www.hrw.org/reports/pdfs/g/greece/greece945.pdf HRW pg.42].<br/>+<br/>+==Macedonians after the Second World War==<br/>+[[Image:19_begalci1.jpg|thumb|250px| Macedonian refugees from Greek Macedonia fleeing across the border during the Greek Civil War]]<br/>+After the Second World War, the [[Communist]] Yugoslav leader [[Josip Broz Tito]] decided that the policy of Serbianization in Macedonia had failed - it had led to strong resentment of Belgrade. In addition, the Macedonians had been strong supporters of Tito's [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Partisan]] resistance movement, fighting the occupying Bulgarians, Germans and Italians as well as opposing the Serbian royalist [[Chetnik]]s, who were, until midway through the war, the West's favorite rebels in Serbia. The Macedonian resistance had a strongly nationalist character, not least as a reaction to Serbia's pre-war repression, same as to the Bulgarian repression during the beginning of the Bulgarian occupation of the region.{{fact}} It was clear well before the end of the war that Tito would seek major changes to the region's political balance.<br/>+<br/>+Following the war, Tito supported the separation of Yugoslav Macedonia from Serbia, making it a republic of the new federal Yugoslavia (as the People's Republic of Macedonia) in [[1946]]. He also supported the concept of a separate Macedonian nation, as a means of further severing the ties of the Slav population of Yugoslav Macedonia with Bulgaria, which were already questionable after the strong Macedonian resistance to the Bulgarian occupation. The differences between the Macedonian and Bulgarian language were emphasized and the region's historical figures were promoted as being uniquely Macedonian (rather than Serbian or Bulgarian). A separate [[Macedonian Orthodox Church]] was established, splitting off from the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] in 1967 (only partly successfully, because the church has not been recognised by any other Orthodox Church yet). The ideologists of a separate and independent Macedonian country, same as the pro-Bulgarian and pro-Serbian sentiment was forcibly suppressed.{{fact}}<br/>+<br/>+Tito had a number of reasons for doing this. First, he wanted to reduce Serbia's dominance in Yugoslavia; establishing a territory formerly considered Serbian as an equal to Serbia within Yugoslavia achieved this effect. Secondly, he wanted to sever the ties of the Macedonian population with Bulgaria, which could undermined the unity of the Yugoslav federation. Thirdly, Tito sought to justify future Yugoslav claims towards the rest of geographical Macedonia; in August [[1944]], he claimed that his goal was to reunify "all parts of Macedonia, divided in 1915 and 1918 by Balkan imperialists." To this end, he opened negotiations with Bulgaria for a new federal state, which would also probably have included Albania, and supported the Greek Communists in the [[Greek Civil War]]. The idea of reunification of all of Macedonia under Communist rule was abandoned in [[1948]] when the Greek Communists lost and Tito fell out with the Soviet Union and pro-Soviet Bulgaria.<br/>+<br/>+Tito's actions had a number of important consequences for the Macedonian. The most important was, obviously, the promotion of a distinctive Macedonian identity as a part of the multiethnic society of Yugoslavia. It may be only the subject of speculations whether Tito forced the Macedonian consciousness on the population of Yugoslav Macedonia or simply lifted the last restrictions to an already existing national sentiment. There have been numerous accounts from northern Macedonia from the late [[1940s]] that the policy of Bulgarization during the Bulgarian occupation ([[1941]]&ndash;[[1944]]) was as abhorrent for the ordinary Macedonian as the policy of Serbization until then.{{fact}} [[IMRO]]'s leader in exile, [[Ivan Mihailov]], and the renewed Bulgarian IMRO after 1990 have, on the other hand, repeatedly argued that between 120,000 and 130,000 people went through the concentration camps of Idrizovo and Goli Otok for pro-Bulgarian sympathies or ideas for independent Macedonia in the late 1940s., which has also been stated by former prime minister [[Ljubčo Georgievski]] [http://www.b-info.com/places/Macedonia/republic/news/95-11/nov15.mak ].{{fact}} The critics of these claims question the number as it would implied roughly a third of the male Christian population at that time; and the reasons of imprisonment, they argue, were multiple as there were Macedonian nationalists, Stalinists, Middle class members, Albanian nationalists and everybody else who was either against the post war regime or denounced as one for whatever reasons. Unlike the time before WWII, when Macedonia was hotbed for unrest and terror and about 60% of the entire royal Yugoslav police force was stationed there [http://www.unet.com.mk/mian/shs.htm] [http://knigite.abv.bg/en/ib/i_banac.html], after the war there were no signs of disturbances comparable with pre-war times or post war times in other parts of former Yugoslavia, such as Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia. [http://www.balkan-archive.org.yu/kosta/new.ustase/list.html] [http://www.pavelicpapers.com/documents/odpor/index.html] [http://www.pavelicpapers.com/documents/ratline/index.html]. Whatever the truth, it was certainly the case that most Macedonians embraced their official recognition as a separate nationality. Even so, some pro-Bulgarian or pro-Serbian sentiment persisted despite government suppression; even as late as [[1991]], convictions were still being handed down for pro-Bulgarian statements.<br/>+<br/>+In Greece, they faced considerably tighter restrictions as its government saw them as a potentially disloyal minority. Greeks were resettled in the region in two occasions, firstly following the Bulgarian loss of the [[Second Balkan War]] when Bulgaria and Greece mutually deported their populations ([[1913]]){{fact}}, and secondly in [[1923]] as a result of the population exchange with Turkey that followed the Greek military defeat in Asia minor. After the Second World War many of the Macedonians who lived in Greece either chose to emigrate to Communist countries (especially Yugoslavia) to avoid prosecution for fighting on the side of the Greek communists (see: [[Greek Civil War]]), or were forced to do so.{{fact}} Although there was some liberalization between [[1959]] and [[1967]], the Greek military dictatorship re-imposed harsh restrictions. The situation gradually eased after Greece's return to democracy, but Greece still get's many critics about the poor treatment of its minorities. <br/>+<br/>+The Macedonians in Albania faced restrictions under the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] [[dictatorship]] of [[Enver Hoxha]], though ordinary Albanians were little better off. Their existence as a separate minority group was recognised as early as 1945 and a degree of cultural expression was permitted.<br/>+<br/>+As ethnographers and linguists tended to identify the population of the Bulgarian part of Macedonia as Bulgarian in the interwar period, the issue of a Macedonian minority in the country came up as late as the [[1940s]]. In [[1946]], the population of [[Blagoevgrad Province]] (also referred to as Pirin Macedonia) was declared Macedonian and teachers were brought in from Yugoslavia to teach the [[Macedonian language]]. The census of [[1946]] was accompanied by mass repressions, the result of which was the complete destruction of the local organisations of the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] and mass internments of people at the Belene concentration camp. The policy was reverted at the end of the [[1950s]] and later Bulgarian governments argued that the two censuses of [[1946]] and [[1956]] which recorded some 200,000 Macedonians were the result of pressure from [[Moscow]]. Western governments remained, however, mistrustful and continued to list the population of Blagoevgrad Province as Macedonian until the beginning of the [[1990s]] despite the [[1965]] census which put Macedonians in the country at 9,000.{{fact}} The two latest censuses after the fall of Communism (in [[1992]] and [[2001]]) have, however, confirmed the results from previous censuses with some 3,000 people declaring themselves as "Macedonians" in Blagoevgrad Province in 2001 (<1.0% of the population of the region) out of 5,000 in the whole of Bulgaria.<br/>+<br/>+During this period, ethnic Macedonians living in the region continue to complain of official harassment.

The Vergina sun is also kept in honour by Greeks, who regard it as an exclusively Greek symbol. The Vergina sun on a red field was the first flag of the independent [[Republic of Macedonia]], until it was removed from the state flag under an agreement reached between the Republic of Macedonia and [[Greece]] in September 1995.

The coat-of-arms is composed by a double bent garland of ears of wheat, tobacco and poppy, tied by a ribbon with the embroidery of a traditional folk costume. In the centre of such a circular room there are mountains, rivers, lakes and the sun; where the ears join there is a red five-pointed star, a traditional symbol of [[Communism]]. All this is said to represent "the richness of our country, our struggle, and our freedom".<br/>+<br/>+<br/>+* '''''Lion:''''' The lion first appears in 1595 in the Korenich-Neorich coat of arms, where the coat of arms of Macedonia is included among with those of eleven other countries.

Later versions of these coat of arms include a more detailed crown and lion with the word "Macedonia" written in a scroll like style.

Some say that in last 15 years their have been disagreement among the Slavophone Albanian citizens about their being members of a Macedonian nation.{{fact}}<br/>+<br/>+* '''Bulgaria''' maintains generally cordial relations with the Macedonians, recognizing them as a distinct ethnic group and last counting them in the [[2001]] census. However, Macedonian groups in the country have reported official harassment, with the Bulgarian Constitutional Court banning a small Macedonian political party in [[2000]] as separatist and Bulgarian local authorities banning political rallies. The 5000-strong Macedonian population in Bulgaria claims to have experienced a period of intensive assimilation and repression.<br/>+<br/>+* '''Greece''' does not recognise any ethnic minorities. Legally, Greece only recognises a "religious minority", the [[Greek Muslim minority]], in [[Thrace]], and opposes the use of the term "Macedonians" to refer to the country's Slav minority, which is centred on the northern Greek town of [[Florina]]. The term "Slavomacedonians" is sometimes used instead, to distinguish them from the Greeks who inhabit Macedonia. There is a Slavic macedonian political party in Greece, the [[Rainbow Party]]: their last (2004) election tally amounted to 6,176 votes (or 0.1%) nationwide (2,955 in the region of Macedonia - out of which 1,200 in the Prefecture of [[Florina]] - and the rest 3,221, were from other parts of Greece. The majority of the Macedonians in Greece have today a Greek national identity, as a result of either conscientious choice or [[coercion]] (discrimination, abuse) of their ancestors in the first half of the twentieth century [http://dev.eurac.edu:8085/mugs2/do/blob.html?type=html&serial=1044526702223].

[[340]]).<br/>-<br/>-He was born at [[Alexandria, Egypt|Alexandria]] in [[Egypt]]. Although very little is known about his life, the written records suggest he was a teacher.<br/>-<br/>-''Synagoge'', his best-known work, is a compendium of mathematics of which eight volumes survive. It covers a wide range of topics, including [[geometry]], [[recreational mathematics]], [[doubling the cube]], [[polygon]]s and [[polyhedron|polyhedra]].<br/>-==His Work==<br/>-Pappus flourished about the end of the 3rd century A.D. In a period of general stagnation in mathematical studies, he stands out as a remarkable exception. How far he was above his contemporaries, how little appreciated or understood by them, is shown by the absence of references to him in other Greek writers, and by the fact that his work had no effect in arresting the decay of mathematical science. In this respect the fate of Pappus strikingly resembles that of [[Diophantus]]. In his ''Collection'', Pappus gives no indication of the date of the authors whose treatises he makes use of, or of the time at which he himself wrote. If we had no other information than can be derived from his work, we should only know that he was later than [[Ptolemy|Claudius Ptolemy]] whom he often quotes. [[Suda|Suidas]] states that he was of the same age as [[Theon of Alexandria]], who wrote commentaries on Ptolemy's great work, the ''Syntaxis mathematica'', and flourished in the reign of [[Theodosius I]]. (A.D. 372-395). Suidas says also that Pappus wrote a commentary upon the same work of Ptolemy. But it would seem incredible that two contemporaries should have at the same time and in the same style composed commentaries upon one and the same work, and yet neither should have been mentioned by the other, whether as friend or opponent. It is more probable that Pappus's commentary was written long before Theon's, but was largely assimilated by the latter, and that Suidas, through failure to disconnect the two commentaries, assigned a like date to both. A different date is given by the marginal notes to a 10th-century MS., where it is stated, in connection with the reign of [[Diocletian]] (A.D. 284-305), that Pappus wrote during that period; and in the absence of any other testimony it seems best to accept the date indicated by the scholiast.<br/>-<br/>-The great work of Pappus, in eight books and entitled ''Synagoge'' or ''Collection'', we possess only in an incomplete form, the first book being lost, and the rest having suffered considerably. Suidas enumerates other works of Pappus. Pappus also wrote commentaries on [[Euclid]]'s ''Elements'' (of which fragments are preserved in Proclus and the Scholia, while that on the tenth Book has been found in an Arabic MS.), and on Ptolemy's ''Ἁρμονικά'' (''Harmonika'').<br/>-<br/>-The characteristics of Pappus's ''Collection'' are that it contains an account, systematically arranged, of the most important results obtained by his predecessors, and, secondly, notes explanatory of, or extending, previous discoveries. These discoveries form, in fact, a text upon which Pappus enlarges discursively. Very valuable are the systematic introductions to the various books which set forth clearly in outline the contents and the general scope of the subjects to be treated. From these introductions we are able to judge of the style of Pappus's writing, which is excellent and even elegant the moment he is free from the shackles of mathematical formulae and expressions. At the same time, his characteristic exactness makes his collection a most admirable substitute for tile texts of the many valuable treatises of earlier mathematicians of which time has deprived us. We proceed to summarize briefly the contents of that portion of the Collection which has survived, mentioning separately certain propositions which seem to be among the most important.<br/>-<br/>-We can only conjecture that the lost book i., as well as book ii., was concerned with arithmetic, book iii. being clearly introduced as beginning a new subject.<br/>-<br/>-The whole of book ii. (the former part of which is lost, the existing fragment beginning in the middle of the 14th proposition) related to a system of multiplication due to ''[[Apollonius of Perga]]''. <br/>-<br/>-Book iii. contains geometrical problems, plane and solid. It may be divided into five sections:<br/>-#On the famous problem of finding two mean proportionals between two given lines, which arose from that of duplicating the cube, reduced by [[Hippocrates]] to the former. Pappus gives several solutions of this problem, including a method of making successive approximations to the solution, the significance of which he apparently failed to appreciate; he adds his own solution of the more general problem of finding geometrically the side of a cube whose content is in any given ratio to that of a given one.<br/>-#On the arithmetic, geometric and harmonic means between two straight lines, and the problem of representing all three in one and the same geometrical figure. This serves as an introduction to a general theory of means, of which Pappus distinguishes ten kinds, and gives a table representing examples of each in whole numbers.<br/>-#On a curious problem suggested by Euclid. i. 21.<br/>-#On the inscribing of each of the five regular polyhedra in a sphere.<br/>-#An addition by a later writer on another solution of the first problem of the book.<br/>-<br/>-Of book iv. the title and preface have been lost, so that the program has to be gathered from the book itself. At the beginning is the well-known generalization of Euclid 1. 47, then follow various theorems on the circle, leading up to the problem of the construction of a circle which shall circumscribe three given circles, touching each other two and two. This and several other propositions on contact, e.g. cases of circles touching one another and inscribed in the figure made of three semicircles and known as "shoemakers knife" form the first division of the book; Pappus turns then to a consideration of certain properties of Archimedes's spiral, the conchoid of Nicomedes (already mentioned in book i. as supplying a method of doubling the cube), and the curve discovered most probably by [[Hippias of Elis]] about 420 B.C., and known by the name, τετραγωνισμός, or [[quadratrix]]. Proposition 30 describes the construction of a curve of double curvature called by Pappus the helix on a sphere; it is described by a point moving uniformly along the arc of a great circle, which itself turns about its diameter uniformly, the point describing a quadrant and the great circle a complete revolution in the same time. The area of the surface included between this curve and its base is found the first known instance of a quadrature of a curved surface. The rest of the book treats of the trisection of an angle, and the solution of more general problems of the same kind by means of the quadratrix and spiral. In one solution of the former problem is the first recorded use of the property of a conic (a hyperbola) with reference to the focus and directrix.<br/>-<br/>-In book v., after an interesting preface concerning regular polygons, and containing remarks upon the hexagonal form of the cells of honeycombs, Pappus addresses himself to the comparison of the areas of different plane figures which have all the same perimeter (following [[Zenodorus]]'s treatise on this subject), and of the volumes of different solid figures which have all the same superficial area, and, lastly, a comparison of the five regular solids of [[Plato]]. Incidentally Pappus describes the thirteen other polyhedra bounded by equilateral and equiangular but not similar polygons, discovered by Archimedes, and finds, by a method recalling that of [[Archimedes]], the surface and volume of a sphere.<br/>-<br/>-According to the preface, book vi. is intended to resolve difficulties occurring in the so-called. It accordingly comments on the ''Sphaerica'' of Theodosius, the ''Moving Sphere'' of Autolycus, Theodosius's book on ''Day and Night'', the treatise of [[Aristarchus of Samos]], ''On the Size and Distances of the Sun and Moon'', and Euclid's ''Optics and Phaenomena''.<br/>-<br/>-The preface of book vii. explains the terms analysis and synthesis, and the distinction between theorem and problem. Pappus then enumerates works of Euclid, Apollonius, Aristaeus and Eratosthenes, thirty-three books in all, the substance of which he intends to give, with the lemmas necessary for their elucidation. With the mention of the ''Porisms of Euclid'' we have an account of the relation of [[porism]] to theorem and problem. In the same preface is included (a) the famous problem known by Pappus's name, often enunciated thus: Having given a number of straight lines, to find the geometric locus of a point such that the lengths of the perpendiculars upon, or (more generally) the lines drawn from it obliquely at given inclinations to, the given lines satisfy the condition that the product of certain of them may bear a constant ratio to the product of the remaining ones; (Pappus does not express it in this form but by means of composition of ratios, saying that if the ratio is given which is compounded of the ratios of pairs one of one set and one of another of the lines so drawn, and of the ratio of the odd one, if any, to a given straight line, the point will lie on a curve given in position); (b) the theorems which were rediscovered by and named after [[Paul Guldin]], but appear to have been discovered by Pappus himself.<br/>-<br/>-Book vii. contains also <br/>-#under the head of the de delerminata section of Apollonius, lemmas which, closely examined, are seen to be cases of the involution of six points; <br/>-#important lemmas on the [[Porism]]s of Euclid;<br/>-#a lemma upon the Surface Loci of Euclid which states that the locus of a point such that its distance from a given point bears a constant ratio to its distance from a given straight line is a conic, and is followed by proofs that the conic is a parabola, ellipse, or hyperbola according as the constant ratio is equal to, less than or greater than I (the first recorded proofs of the properties, which do not appear in Apollonius).<br/>-<br/>-Lastly, book viii. treats principally of mechanics, the properties of the center of gravity, and some mechanical powers. Interspersed are some questions of pure geometry. Proposition 14 shows how to draw an ellipse through five given points, and Prop. 15 gives a simple construction for the axes of an ellipse when a pair of conjugate diameters are given.<br/>-<br/>-==Theorems==<br/>-In [[geometry]], there are several theorems that are known by the generic name '''Pappus's Theorem''', attributing them to [[Pappus of Alexandria]]. They include:<br/>-<br/>-* [[Pappus's centroid theorem]],<br/>-* the [[Pappus chain]],<br/>-* [[Pappus's harmonic theorem]], and<br/>-* [[Pappus's hexagon theorem]].<br/>+{{Infobox Cricketer |<br/>+flag = Sri_lanka_flag_large.png |<br/>+nationality = Sri Lanka |<br/>+country = Sri Lankan |<br/>+country abbrev =  SL |<br/>+name = Ranjith Madurasinghe |<br/>+picture = Cricket_no_pic.png |<br/>+batting style = Left-hand bat |<br/>+bowling style = Right-arm offbreak |<br/>+balls = true |<br/>+tests = 3 |<br/>+test runs = 24 |<br/>+test bat avg = 4.79 |<br/>+test 100s/50s = -/- |<br/>+test top score = 11 |<br/>+test overs = 396 |<br/>+test wickets = 3 |<br/>+test bowl avg = 57.33 |<br/>+test 5s = - |<br/>+test 10s = - |<br/>+test best bowling = 3/60 |<br/>+test catches/stumpings = -/- |<br/>+ODIs = 12 |<br/>+ODI runs = 21 |<br/>+ODI bat avg = 10.50 |<br/>+ODI 100s/50s = -/- |<br/>+ODI top score = 8* |<br/>+ODI overs = 480 |<br/>+ODI wickets = 5 |<br/>+ODI bowl avg = 71.59 |<br/>+ODI 5s = - |<br/>+ODI 10s = - |<br/>+ODI best bowling = 1/11 |<br/>+ODI catches/stumpings = 3/- |<br/>+date = 9 February |<br/>+year = 2006 |<br/>+source = http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/player/49624.html}}<br/> <br/> <br/>-== Reference ==<br/>-* ''Pappus of Alexandria'' [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]<br/>-{{1911}}<br/>-[[Category:Ancient mathematicians]]<br/>-[[Category:Ancient Greek mathematicians]]<br/>-[[Category:Egyptian mathematicians]]<br/>-<br/>-[[de:Pappos]]<br/>-[[fr:Pappus]]<br/>-[[ja:&#12497;&#12483;&#12503;&#12473;]]<br/>-[[pl:Pappus z Aleksandrii]]<br/>-[[sl:Papos]]<br/>-[[sv:Pappos]]<br/>+'''Madurasinghe Arachchige Wijayasiri Ranjith Madurasinghe''' (born [[January 30]], [[1961]], [[Kurunegala]]) is a former [[Sri Lanka]]n [[cricket]]er who played in 3 [[Test cricket|Tests]] and 12 [[One-day International|ODI]]s from 1988 to 1992.<br/>+{{SriLanka-cricketbio-stub}}<br/>+[[Category:1961 births|Madurasinghe, Ranjith]]<br/>+[[Category:Living people|Madurasinghe, Ranjith]]<br/>+[[Category:Sri Lankan Test cricketers|Madurasinghe, Ranjith]]<br/>+[[Category:Sri Lankan  ODI cricketers|Madurasinghe, Ranjith]]<br/>+[[Category:Sri Lankan cricketers|Madurasinghe, Ranjith]]</td>

I'm a conservation ecologist, herpetologist, and tropical biologist.  I hope to distribute my demonstrated nerdiness on these topics throughout Wikipedia.<br/> <br/>-The '''WWE Championship''', also known as the '''World Wrestling Entertainment Championship''', '''WWE championship of the World''' or '''WWE Heavyweight Championship''', is one of the two top "world [[Championship (professional wrestling)|championships]]" contested in [[World Wrestling Entertainment]]. It is the WWE's original World's championship and was exclusive to the [[WWE Friday Night SmackDown!|SmackDown!]] brand between [[August 26]], [[2002]] and [[June 6]], [[2005]], while the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] was exclusive to the [[WWE RAW|RAW]] brand; however, when WWE Champion [[John Cena]] was drafted to RAW during the 2005 [[WWE Draft|WWE Draft Lottery]], he took the belt with him to RAW. Since then, the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] has moved to SmackDown! due to the draft of then-Champion [[David Bautista|Batista]] on [[June 30]], [[2005]].<br/>+I'm just starting out here, but think that the [[decline in frog populations]] article needs serious work, and hope to make this a priority.  I also have lots of cool nature photos to upload once I figure out how to upload files.<br/> <br/>-==History==<br/>-[[Image:wwfbelt.jpg|180px|thumb|right|WWF World Heavyweight Championship (1988 - 1998)]]<br/>-The WWE Championship was originally known as the '''WWWF (World Wide Wrestling Federation) World Heavyweight Championship'''. In 1971, the WWWF rejoined the [[National Wrestling Alliance]], and the title was downgraded in status to become simply the '''WWWF Heavyweight Championship'''. In 1979, the promotion dropped "Wide" from its name, thus renaming the title the '''World Wrestling Federation Heavyweight Championship''' (or '''WWF Heavyweight Championship'''). After the WWF left the NWA in [[1983]], the title was referred to as the '''WWF World Heavyweight Championship'''.  Beginning in the 1990s, the title was refered to as simply the '''WWF Championship''' (also commonly lengthened to '''World Wrestling Federation Championship''').<br/>-<br/>-It was unified with another title, then called the World Championship (though more commonly known through lineage as the [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship]]), on [[December 9]] [[2001]] by [[Chris Jericho]] at the [[WWE Vengeance#2001|WWF Vengeance]] [[pay-per-view]] event in [[San Diego, California]]. Whilst [[Championship unification|unified]], both championship belts were used and they were collectively defended as the [[WWE Undisputed Championship|WWF Undisputed Championship]] until [[April 1]] [[2002]] when [[Ric Flair]] presented then-champion [[Triple H]] with a single belt representing both titles. During the title reign of [[Hulk Hogan|Hollywood Hulk Hogan]], legal matters forced the company to change its name to WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment) and the championship was likewise renamed, with the WWF logo on the belt being replaced with a new WWE logo. The belt style remained in use, and the combined title was known as the '''WWE Undisputed Championship''' until [[August 26]] [[2002]], when the champion at the time, [[Brock Lesnar]], refused to defend the championship against a RAW brand wrestler following a number-one contender's match won by Triple H. Lesnar claimed he would only defend his championship against SmackDown! brand wrestlers, despite previous tradition that the Undisputed Champion would defend their championship against wrestlers from either brand.<br/>-<br/>-[[Image:Wwe_smokingskull.jpg|180px|thumb|right|Stone Cold Steve Austin's customized "Smoking Skull" belt]]<br/>-<br/>-Following Lesnar's actions, RAW General Manager [[Eric Bischoff]] awarded the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] to Triple H on [[September 2]] [[2002]], to act as RAW's premier champion. This left the former Undisputed Champion Brock Lesnar as simply the '''WWE Champion''', with no "undisputed" label. Both championships have since become exclusive to both brands.<br/>-<br/>-When John Cena was drafted to RAW on [[June 6]] [[2005]], both belts were briefly RAW-exclusive until [[David Bautista|Batista]], the World Heavyweight Champion at the time, was drafted to SmackDown! on [[June 30]] [[2005]].<br/>-[[Image:WWE_JohnCena.jpg|thumb|right|John Cena's customized version of the WWE Championship 2005-present]]<br/>-<br/>-==Trivia==<br/>-*The longest reign was that of [[Bruno Sammartino]] at 2803 days (over seven years). <br/>-**The longest reign for a [[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] wrestler was that of [[Billy Graham (wrestler)| "Superstar" Billy Graham]] at 296 days.<br/>-*The shortest reign was that of [[André the Giant]], who handed the title over to [[Ted DiBiase]] 45 seconds after winning it from [[Hulk Hogan]]. It was later declared an invalid transaction and the title vacated.<br/>-**The second shortest reign was [[Rodney Anoai|Yokozuna's]] first reign. Shortly after he had defeated [[Bret Hart]] for the title at [[WrestleMania IX]], Yokozuna's [[manager (professional wrestling)|manager]], [[Harry Fujiwara|Mr. Fuji]], rashly challenged [[Hulk Hogan]] to face Yokozuna. Hogan, with the blessing of Hart, entered the ring and won the title in 25 seconds, making Yokozuna's total reign 2 minutes and 17 seconds.<br/>-*The record for most WWE Championships held by a single person is seven, held by [[The Rock (entertainer)|The Rock]]. [[Hulk Hogan]] and [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] have six reigns, [[Bret Hart]] and [[Triple H]] have five, [[Mark Calaway|The Undertaker]] and [[Kurt Angle]] have four, and [[Shawn Michaels]], [[Mick Foley]], and [[Brock Lesnar]] have three. Due to some controversial matches, [[Bob Backlund]] can lay claim to two additional reigns on top of his two official ones, totaling four.<br/>-*The oldest champion was [[Vince McMahon]], who won the title at the age of 54 in [[1999]].<br/>-**The second oldest champion is [[Hulk Hogan]], who won his sixth championship when he was 48.

Nambiars are found mostly in the [[Kannur]] district. <br/>-<br/>-There are two types of Nambiars. The ones from North Kerala were the traditional protectors of [[Namboothiri]]s, and are thought to be an [[Aryan race]], having migrated to Kerala with the Namboothiris from outside India (See [[Aryan Invasion Theory]]). Their non-indigenous (non-[[Dravidian]]) origins are affirmed by their ligher complexion, sharper features and above all their distinctly different customs and traditions, which are in fact strikingly similar to those of North Indian and even [[Indo-Aryan]] customs and traditions. <br/>-They share the same occupation (that of a warrior and ruler) and thus they are classed as [[Nair|Nayar]]s, although they are of a different race to the Nayars who some consider to be Dravidian in origin. Other Nambiars, especially from South Kerala are ''Ambalavasis'' (meaning who leaves near [[Hindu]] [[Temple]]s in [[Malayalam]]), who having mixed with [[Namboothiri]]s, occupy a position in the [[Hindu]] [[Temple]], associating with the priestly caste in managing the affairs of the temple, though not the actual conduct of ceremonies.  They were also protectors of the temple from a martial point of view against marauding [[fiefdom]]s. <br/>-<br/>-Nambiars as a warrior race were closely affiliated with the practice of [[Kalaripayattu]], the earliest form of martial arts in India. Along with the [[Kurup]]s and other Nayar sub-castes, they formed a pivotal role in the ruling of Kerala. Nambiars, as it is with other Nayar communities, belonged to certain clans (known as [[tharavadu]]s). For each group of towns (known as a Desom) there would be one Nayar clan to rule over them. Kings (the [[Varma]]s, also a type of Nayar} would control many Desoms, and thus the Nayars served as ministers in the Raja's court to oversee the ruling of the land. In particular the Kurups and the Nambiars from North Kerala served as military commanders and generals, helping to develop Kalaripayattu and other warfare techniques.<br/>-<br/>-Traditionally, the ambalavasi Nambiars were used to marrying from the priestly community, the [[Namboothri]] community. Although they were not considered to be Namboothiris, or [[Brahmin]]s, these Nambiars wear a "Poonuul" (holy string) aroung their chest as a symbol of their position in the temple.<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-*[[List of Famous Nairs|List of Famous Nayars]]<br/>-*[[List of Nair Tharavadus|List of Nayar Tharavadus]]<br/>-<br/>-{{Kerala-stub}}<br/>-[[Category:Social groups of India]]<br/>-[[Category:Indian surnames]]<br/>-[[Category:Caste]]<br/>+<font size=3>This man is an imposter, for </font><b><font size=5>I</font></b><font size=3> am the prime minister of Canada!!!!

I am writing to you because you voted "keep" in AfD for aetherometry entry.  The present situation is that by Wikipedia standards there is no reputable secondary literature at all about aetherometry.  The minority view is contained only in primary sources, which do not even fulfill Wikipedia standards for scientific references, and there are no other publications, so there is no majority view.  "Majority view" here does not mean view of majority of Wikipedia administrators, it means published and generally accepted view of outside scientific community.  There is nothing like this for aetherometry.  As result,  nothing in entry can be verified or referenced, it is all interpretation and opinion.  This is not how encyclopedia should work, and is against Wikipedia policy.  Since you said that entry should be kept, you must have idea how entry can start to provide verifiable encyclopedic information when there are no existing secondary sources.  How can this problem be solved?  I think you cannot just say "keep" and leave to others dealing with this problem, which to me seems completely not solvable.  Please, describe what your solution is, and how you will personally help make aetherometry entry honest, reputable and verifiable.  Sincerely, Janusz.

NASA considered aborting the flight.  <br/> <br/>-{{Wales preserved counties}}<br/>+Several months before the flight, Aaron had been going over simulator data when he, on his own initiative, began examining the obscure ''Signal Condition Equipment'' system and its functions. He became one of the only mission controllers who was familier with the system and its operations.  He recommended that the flight crew set the system to "auxiliary" mode to try to restore the system.  <br/> <br/>-[[Category:Preserved counties of Wales]]<br/>-[[Category:Glamorgan]]<br/>+When he gave the order, "Flight, try SCE to 'Aux'", most of his mission control colleagues had no idea what he was talking about.

He is also credited with developing the innovative powerup sequence that allowed the Command Module to conserve enough power for a safe reentry.  <br/>+<br/>+Going against existion NASA protocol, he ordered the instrumentation system to be turned on last, just before reentry, rather than first.  The call was a calculated risk.  Without the instrumentation system, the crew and controlers would not know for certain if the cold startup had been sucessful until the last possible moment before rentry.

The series was created by [[Kevin Gillis]], and produced first at Atkinson Film-Arts (from 1985-1986), then at newly established [[Hinton Animation Studios]] (from 1987 on).<br/>+'''Organizational performance''' comprises the actual output or results of an [[organization]] as measured against its intended outputs (or [[Objective|goal]]s and [[objectives]]).<br/> <br/>-The series features the adventures in the Evergreen Forest of Bert [[Raccoon]] and his friends Ralph and Melissa, particularly in their attempts to thwart the anti-environmentalist actions of pink [[aardvark]] Cyril Sneer and his trio of pig henchmen (all of whom were referred to as Lloyd, and only by each other).  One unique element of the series is that Cyril evolves from an unrepentantly destructive capitalist to a likeable and environmentally responsible, if still highly aggressive, businessman and occasional ally of the Raccoons.  Another nasty character was the capitalist Mr. Knox&mdash;a crocodile with a New Orleans accent.

Lisa is the older statuesque sister of Bentley Raccoon, and the daughter of George and Nicole Raccoon. She is the love interest/best friend of Bert Raccoon.

In [[East Asia]], the series has a large cult following, but has not received much recognition internationally. The series has been compared to ''[[Sid Meier's Pirates!]]'' in [[gameplay]] and theme. It is a [[simulation]] and [[computer role-playing game|CRPG]] series dealing with sailing and trading.<br/> <br/>-==Upper middle class in the U.S.==<br/>-There are two definitions of Upper-middle class in the U.S. The first definition classifies all households with a net worth over $250,000 and with an income of $65,000 or more as upper-middle class, about 18.2% of all households. The second defenition describes all housholds ranked as part of both the fourth net worth quintile and fourth income quintile.<br/>+In the games, the player takes up the role of a [[captain]] (also called [[commodore (rank)|commodore]] in some translations) and manages a seagoing fleet to participate in [[trade]]s, [[privateer]]ing, treasure hunting, [[exploration]], and plain [[pirate|piracy]]. Even though the series is largely open-ended, there is still a loose [[plot]] which requires the player to follow certain paths, and deviating from these paths may stall the progress of the story.<br/> <br/>-==The English Upper Middle Class==<br/>+==Historical background==<br/>+''Main article: [[Age of Exploration]]''<br/> <br/>-This is a very specific class in England and is, in many respects, peculiar to England as its characteristics do not fit easily into the social gradations of the other constituent parts of the United kingdom.<br/>+In Japanese, the term ''Daikoukai Jidai'' refers to the period between the [[15th century]] and the [[17th century]], when [[Europe]]an explorers sailed the seas to open new alternative ways to [[Asia]] when the [[Ottoman Empire]] blocked the land [[trade route|routes]] and led to the decline of [[port|port cities]] that previously prospered from the trade.<br/> <br/>-In England this class of people is less easily defined and personal wealth is not a necessary criterion. Frequently its members are members of professions, which were traditionally law and medicines, although merchants too were able to penetrate its ranks. However, being member of a profession does not automatically elevate a person to this class and it is quite common for an upper middle class person not to work in a traditional profession.<br/>+This period was characterized by the rivalry between Spain and Portugal, the advent of [[colonization]], and general exploration. In later games, other countries are also involved. Some historical events during the Age of Exploration, like [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], were mentioned.<br/> <br/>-Instead, accent, language, education (usually at a good [[public school]]), family background and understatement, in both behaviour and taste, are defining charateristics of the upper middles. Although not of the landowning class, its members may aspire to the characteristics of, or be described as, [[gentlemen]]. <br/>+The game series makes many references to the historical background, although much like ''Pirates!'', the more treacherous details of the era are idealized to create a more adventurous and exciting mood.<br/> <br/>-The character of Charles Ryder in Evelyn Waugh's novel, [[Brideshead Revisited]] is a fine example of an early twentieth century upper middle class Englishman. His language, accent and manners are similar to an aristocrat's but in place of the aristoctrat's self-assuredness there is a air of slight uncertainty. A more modern day example is Charles in [[Four Weddings and a Funeral]], played by [[Hugh Grant]]. <br/>+==''Uncharted Waters''==<br/>+In the first game of the series, the player assumes the role of Leon Franco, the young, ambitious son of a noble family fallen on hard times in [[Portugal]]. The goal of the game is to restore the family's former glory and achieve Leon's dreams. Only three nations are represented, Portugal, [[Spain]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]], although there are many neutral ports around the world that the player can "invest" in and thus make part of Portugal's sphere of influence. This, as well as discovering ports and defeating other merchants and pirates in sea battles, increases Leon's fame. With increased fame, Leon can complete tasks for the King of Portugal and increase in rank.<br/> <br/>-In terms of language, an English upper middle class person would generally use the words 'napkin', 'lavatory' (or more commonly now the slightly less patrician 'loo'), 'sofa', 'sitting-room', 'pudding' and 'sorry' or 'what' in preference to 'serviette', 'toilet', 'couch', 'lounge', 'dessert' and 'pardon' used by the classes 'below' them. <br/>- <br/>+The story is set in the early [[16th century]]. It was released on [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] in [[1991]] and [[Sega Genesis]] and [[SNES]] in [[1992]]. The English versions were also released in the same years respectively.<br/> <br/>+==''Uncharted Waters 2''==<br/>+Also known as ''Uncharted Waters: New Horizons'', this game is perhaps the most famous of the series. Even though an English version exists, it still has not managed to achieve the [[mainstream]] popularity ''Pirates!'' had. There is only a relatively small following outside of East Asia.<br/> <br/>-==General Defenition== The upper-middle class is a sub-label sometimes applied by [[sociology|sociologists]] to the [[social group]] of wealthier or more privileged members of the [[middle class]]. This is in contrast to the term [[lower middle class]] used for the group at the other end of the middle class scale. There is considerable debate as to how the upper middle class might be defined (whether by [[education]], [[wealth]], or the [[prestige]] or [[skill]] level of their [[profession]]) and whether these sub-labels are useful at all (especially whether "lower middle class" simply refers to relatively materially wealthy members of the lower class, in which case the term "upper middle class" may simply represent the true middle class, or conversely when "lower middle class refers to people who are a station above the working class, and thus the real middle class and the upper middle class meaning something much more affluent).<br/>+Also set in the 16th century, this game is a [[sequel]] to the first title and was released for [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] and Sega Genesis System in [[1994]]. In ''Uncharted Waters 2'', there are six [[protagonist]]s to choose from, each of them representing a path or [[career]] featured in the game. They are listed as follows:<br/> <br/>-One can easily assert that certain professions can be safely judged as "upper middle class" stations in life, such as: [[Physician]], [[Lawyer]], [[University]] [[Professor]], [[Corporate Executive]], [[Architect]], [[Engineer]], mid to large [[Business Owner]], and of course, high level [[Civil Servants]].  Generally these people earn a comfortable living that in American terms is usually well into six figures per annum.  Most own large homes in affluent suburbs of major cities, or reside in smart urban residences usually near major universities.  People from this station in life have an enormously high regard for higher education, and probably more than any other socio-economic class, strive to educate themselves and their children at only the most prestigious universities available at home or abroad.  They place a high value on foreign travel, the arts, and [[high culture]] in general.  The majority regard themselves as Liberal on social issues, but some are Conservative when it comes to fiscal matters.  This should be noted is the reverse of how most [[working class]] people view the world, which explains why these two groups clash more than say the lower middle class and the working class. <br/>+* João Franco: Son of Leon from the first game, a Portuguese [[List of explorers|explorer]]<br/>+* [[Catalina de Erauso]]: Former [[Spain|Spanish]] naval officer, a [[pirate]]<br/>+* Otto Baynes: [[England|English]] naval officer, a [[privateer]]<br/>+* Ernst Von Bohr: [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[cartographer]]<br><br/>+*Pietro Conti: [[Italy|Italian]] treasure hunter<br/>+*Ali Vezas: [[Turkey|Turkish]] merchant<br/> <br/>-Material items of high prestige within this class are foreign made luxury automobiles, fine tailoring, high-end furniture, memberships to country clubs or other exclusive organizations, and restaurants specializing in haute-cuisine.  Most sociologists maintain that one should make the distinction of two separate sets within the upper middle class, and they are a [[Professional Class]] and a [[Managerial Class]].  The Professional Class is composed of highly educated specialists such as Doctors, Lawyers and Academics, while the Managerial Class is made up mostly of mid to high level Corporate Executives.  The professionals generally are more liberal in their outlook and much more urban and chic in their tastes, while the managers tend to be more conservative, materialistic and suburban in their preferences.<br/>+While the game is more or less open-ended, developing the character's career is necessary to advance the plot.<br/>+<br/>+==''Daikokai Jidai Gaiden''==<br/>+A side story released in [[1997]] on [[PlayStation]] after ''New Horizons'', the game uses the same [[game engine|engine]] and focuses on the story of two [[fictional character|characters]] instead, further expounding upon the loose plot that ties the series together. The two protagonists are as follows:<br/>+<br/>+Miranda Verute ([[Japanese language|Japanese]] transliteration): [[Genoese]] adventurer who mistakenly thought the treasure hunter, Pietro Conti, had asked for her hand in marriage, and sets off to find him<br><br/>+Salvadore Reifu (Japanese transliteration): pirate and adopted son of Red Beard of [[Algiers]]<br><br/>+<br/>+==''Daikoukai Jidai 3''==<br/>+This title was the first to depart from the [[formula]] and engine of the series. The traditional focus on story was removed in this game, and some character customization is possible, if only purely decorative. There are two [[player character]]s, from Portugal and Spain respectively, although the differences are mainly mechanical, and the role-playing element was greatly reduced.<br/>+<br/>+The theme of exploration is heavily emphasized, as land travel is now possible, and there is a lot more to be explored and discovered overall, compared to the early titles. The game starts in the mid [[fifteenth century]] and allows for the player to make historical discoveries such as the [[New World]] or a route to [[India]]. Also, the game experiments with the concept of [[language]] in a video game, a feature uncommon in the industry, and necessitating the hiring of translators and teachers. The player can also continue the game by marrying bar-girls and having children, who in turn can continue the seafaring tradition and even take on part of his father's skills and inventory. Perhaps it is due to these dramatic changes that Daikoukai Jidai 3 left players uncomfortable and failed to achieve much popularity even within Japan.<br/>+<br/>+==''Uncharted Waters IV: Porto Estado''==<br/>+<br/>+This game returns to the previous formula, although its open-endedness has decreased and the engine has been updated. This title is plot-wise unrelated to the series that ended in ''Gaiden''. ''Porto Estado'' is known for its fine artworks and high-quality [[drawing|illustration]]s.<br/>+<br/>+The story evolves on the search of the seven '''Proof of the Conqueror''', which are seven ancient artifacts, in seven areas around the world (Northern Europe, Meditarrean, Africa, New World, Indian Ocean, South Asia and East Asia). It is said that having these proofs proves that the sailor is the champion of all sailors. Four sailors (plus another three in expansion) unwittingly involved in the struggle of the quest of the search of the ''Proof of the Conqueror''. It is interesting that sailors are no longer from Europe: two of the seven characters are from Asia, plus another one from Caribbean.<br/>+<br/>+There are many significant changes in this game. For example, the game no longer have the concept of year and the result is that characters in this game will not age. Also, player can set up regional fleets and these regional fleets are valuable financial resources. In combat, naval battle is now fought in real time.<br/>+<br/>+The country boundary has disappeared, literally. Each character is only represented by their own guild and their home country is not important in gameplay. Ports in this game also has a market share rating in a percentage scale. Player can trade in a port only when his guild has some market share in that port, which can be gained by signing a contract with the local governor.<br/>+<br/>+===''Uncharted Waters IV: Rota Nova''===<br/>+<br/>+KOEI plans to release Rota Nova February 2006 in Japan.  This is a remake of "Uncharted Waters IV: Porto Estado" for handhelds:<br/>+<br/>+* The PSP version will include a ship race function.<br/>+* The DS version will include use of the stylus and map.<br/>+<br/>+==''Uncharted Waters Online''==<br/>+A new [[MMORPG]], the latest in the series, was released in the Japan on March 16th 2005. The Korean version was released by CJ Internet on November 30th 2005 ([http://www.koei.co.jp/flash/press/pdfs/20051125_dol.pdf Press Release]). The Taiwan version, including Taiwan, Honk Kong, and Macao, produced by Softstar will move to full service on January 17 2006 ([http://gvo.joypark.com.tw/news/news_info.aspx?news_no=3747&category_id=SYSTEM Official News Site]).  Further news is to be expected on the Chinese version. The release dates for the North America and Europe are yet to be announced. The complete game is currently available on Windows platform as well as mobile-to-game mail service for [[I-Mode]], [[EZweb]], or [[Vodafone Live!]] capable mobile phones ([http://www.gamecity.ne.jp/dol/mobile/ GVO@Mobile]).<br/>+<br/>+The player may choose from among 6 nationalities: English, Dutch, French, Spanish, Portugeuse, Venezian.  As well the player may choose from several "occupations" after choosing a basic class: adventurer, merchant, and soldier.  However players can learn and upgrade skills from other classes, albeit needing more experience points.  Under certain conditions a player may change their class, occupation, and nationality.  Players will be able to trade, explore, battle and join in live events such as "Great Sea Fights".<br/>+<br/>+[[Category:Computer and video game franchises]]<br/>+<br/>+[[ko:대항해시대 (게임)]]<br/>+[[ja:大航海時代 (ゲーム)]]<br/>+[[zh:大航海時代 (遊戲)]]</td>

In some places, domestically-produced sandals are available for the equivalent of less than US$1 and, despite their disposable design, street vendors will repair worn sandals for a small fee.  Sometimes these flip-flops are made of recycled rubber [[tire]]s, lowering the cost even more.  They are many economically disadvantaged peoples' only footwear, and hence are worn for a wide variety of tasks, including farming, construction, and other heavy manual work. <br/>-<br/>-Although flip-flops are one of the most simple, humble forms of footwear, many people consider them comfortable. Flip-flops tend to conform to the foot structure of the wearer.  Some people like to wear the sandals every day. Unfortunately, flip-flops are often not very sturdy and the straps may snap after moderate use. They can be fixed, but many people choose to just buy new ones, discarding away the old ones. The average [[life expectancy]] of a pair isn't very long for precisely this reason, perhaps only a year or so. A pair is lucky to make it more than a couple of years before being rendered into trash. The [[Klip-Flop]] style has reinvented flip-flops to mollify the annoyance of strap snap by creating interchangeable straps that lock into the EVA sole with a turn of a penny.<br/>-<br/>-<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:dangle.jpg|thumb|right|A pair of flip-flops worn by a young girl]] --><br/>-The term "flip-flop" derives from the rhythmic slapping noise that the sandals make while slapping against the wearer's [[heel]]s and the floor as he or she [[walk]]s.

We are an encyclopedia, not a hate site, personal weblog, or Uncyclopedia. Thanks.<br/> <br/>-'''Spock''', also called '''Mr. Spock''', the [[Vulcan]] who must repress his emotions, was one of the most famous [[fictional character]]s to be introduced in [[Star Trek: The Original Series|the original]] ''[[Star Trek]]'' television series.  He is half [[human]] and half [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcan]], and was portrayed by actor [[Leonard Nimoy]] (except for some scenes in ''[[Star Trek III: The Search for Spock]]'' showing a younger Spock).<br/>+There has been disagreement about whether this disambig should be here. If you think it should, please argue this on the discussion page.<br/>+--><br/> <br/>-== Personal life ==<br/>-Spock is the son of the [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcan]] ambassador [[Sarek]] and his human wife [[Amanda Grayson]].  Although Spock identified himself as Vulcan, he had an ongoing internal conflict between the [[reason]] and [[logic]] of his Vulcan half and the [[emotion]] and [[intuition]] of his human half.  By human standards, however, he was incredibly logical and utterly unflappable in the face of danger.<br/>+{{Otheruses4|the video game and related characters|the [[oncogene]] once called '''Pokemon'''|Zbtb7}}<br/> <br/>-Spock had an older half-brother, [[Sybok]], who eschewed pure logic, and was banished from Vulcan for his heresy.  <br/> <br/>-Spock is generally considered to have married at some point, because Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]] once observed that he had met [[Sarek]] at "his son's wedding".  Seeing as [[Sybok]] died before Picard was even born, it is safe to assume that he was referring to Spock's marriage.  The non-canon novel ''Vulcan's Heart'' features the marriage of Spock and [[Saavik]]. <br/> <br/>-In the episode "''[[This Side of Paradise (Star Trek)|This Side of Paradise]]''", it is implied that Spock has an additional name.  It seems likely that his family name is unpronounceable by those who speak Federation Standard and Spock is his familiar/personal name.<br/>+Jason V is the best known player at this game . Along with Henry F.<br/>+And Lauren/Cruz Ferera And cruz f are the worst and they are now happily married<br/> <br/>-In the non-[[Canon (fiction)|canon]] novel [[List of Star Trek novels|''Yesterday's Son'']], Spock is revealed to have fathered a son while trapped in the past on the subsequently destroyed planet Sarpeidon.  In the sequel, ''Time for Yesterday'', Zar returns to mindmeld once more with the Guardian of Forever.<br/> <br/>-== Early years ==<br/>-According to the non-canon animated series, Spock was subject to considerable harassment by his peers as a "half-breed" in his youth, and he was deeply conflicted as to what path to follow.  To prove himself, he prematurely underwent an important coming of age trial without his parents' knowledge, but his pet [[sehlat]], [[I-Chaya]] insisted on accompanying him against his guardian's wishes.  During the trial, a dangerous beast attacked the pair and I-Chaya was seriously wounded fighting it.  Although they were saved by a relative who had followed them (actually the adult Spock himself who had gone back in time to save himself at this moment), I-Chaya needed immediate medical attention.  Although Spock was able to bring a healer, the sehlat was beyond meaningful aid when he arrived.  When presented with the options granting his pet a painful extended life or a merciful release, Spock logically chose to have I-Chaya euthanized.  That decision marked his commitment to follow the philosophies of [[Surak]] and the Vulcan ideals of logic and strict emotional control. (See [[Star Trek: The Animated Series]] for an explanation as to why this material is not considered canon by Paramount Pictures.)<br/> <br/>-In 2267, he earned the Vulcanian Scientific Legion of Honor and held an A7 [[computer]] expert classification.<br/>+'''''Pokémon''''' (ポケモン ''Pokemon''<!--Don't accent THIS one-->, pronounced /{{IPA|'poʊ.kɛ.mɑn}}/, although frequently, and even intentionally mispronounced /{{IPA|poʊ.ki.'mæn}}/), is a [[video game]] franchise, created by [[Satoshi Tajiri]] and published by [[Nintendo]] for several of their systems, most importantly the [[Game Boy]]. It has been [[Merchandising|merchandised]] into [[anime]], [[manga]], [[trading cards]], [[toy]]s, and much more. The name Pokémon is a [[portmanteau]] of its Japanese name, “'''Po'''c'''ke'''t '''Mon'''sters” (ポケットモンスター '''''Poke'''tto '''Mon'''sutā'').<br/> <br/>-== Starfleet ==<br/>-Nearly Spock's entire [[Starfleet]] career &mdash; he joined Starfleet against his father's wishes, as Sarek wanted his son to attend the Vulcan Science Academy &mdash; was spent serving onboard a single ship, the famous [[starship]] [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'']]. The non-canon young adult novel 'Crisis on Vulcan' depicts Spock's first experience with the ship. He accompanies his father on a diplomatic mission aboard the Enterprise, and while there meets his future captain, Christopher Pike, then serving as the first officer under Robert April, the first captain of the Enterprise. Spock becomes impressed at the humans, and particularly with the logical setup of the ship, which leads him to consider a career in Starfleet, which becomes a serious consideration when Pike invites him to do so. <br/>+'''Pokémon''' is also the collective name for the fictional creatures within the ''Pokémon'' universe. The franchise has 386 unique [[monster]]s that lie at the heart of the ''Pokémon'' series (391 including currently known Pokémon from future games). These figures have grown from the 151 monsters - including #151 [[Mew (Pokémon)|Mew]] - from the original [[Pokémon Red and Blue|Pokémon Red/Blue]] games.<br/> <br/>-He served for nearly eleven years under Captain [[Christopher Pike]].  Publications from the producers of the Original Series indicate that Spock's "backstory" had him assigned to the Enterprise while still a [[Cadet]], and that he was later commissioned an [[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]] and subsequently promoted to the rank of [[Lieutenant Junior Grade]].  The first time the viewing audience saw Spock he was a full [[Lieutenant]], serving as a junior science officer onboard the Enterprise (''[[Star Trek: The Cage]]''), although series creator [[Gene Roddenberry]] originally billed Spock as the ship's [[Deck department|First Lieutenant]].  Some of Spock's experiences serving under Captain Pike were depicted in the non-canon comic book series ''[[Star Trek: Early Voyages]]''.<br/>+As of 2006, Pokémon USA Inc., a subsidiary of [[Japan]]'s Pokémon Co., will oversee all Pokémon licensing outside of [[Asia]].<br/> <br/>-Spock's first temporary command was in 2254 when he ordered the evacuation of the ''Enterprise'' from [[Talos IV]], after all of the senior officers had been kidnapped by the hostile inhabitants.  In the early 2260s, Spock was promoted  to [[Lieutenant Commander]] and assigned a dual commission as both the Executive Officer (or ''First Officer'') and Senior Science Officer of the ''Enterprise'' under Captain [[James T. Kirk]] (''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]''), with whom he became good friends, but Spock was constantly getting into arguments with the more passionate Dr. Leonard "Bones" McCoy.  By 2267, Spock had risen in rank to a full [[Commander]].  He resigned his commission in 2270 in order to return to Vulcan and undergo training for the [[Kolinahr]] discipline.<br/>+==Origins==<br/>+[[Image:Pokemon logo.gif|thumb|125px|The logo with the “Gotta catch 'em all” slogan.]]The concept of ''Pokémon'' evolved from [[insect]] collecting, a simple pastime many Japanese children (including Pokémon's creator, [[Satoshi Tajiri]], as a child) had enjoyed in the past. First introduced in Japan as a pair of [[Game Boy]] games—Pocket Monster Red and Green—in 1996, the franchise arrived in the west in 1998 as [[Pokémon Red and Blue]]. The ''Pokémon'' games allowed players to catch, collect, and train hundreds of cute and monstrous [[pets]], known as Pokémon (short for Pocket Monsters), with various abilities, and battle them against each other to build their strength and evolve them into more powerful Pokémon. The Pokémon creatures never bleed or die, only faint. This was a very touchy subject to Tajiri, as he didn't want to further fill the gaming world with pointlessly violent games.<br/> <br/>-In 2271 Spock returned to active duty, reinstated as a Commander, and posted as the Senior Science Officer to the USS ''Enterprise''.  Following the [[V'ger]] crisis (chronicled in ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]''), and the loss of ''Enterprise'' Executive Officer, Captain [[Willard Decker]], Spock apparently resumed his dual post of First Officer and Senior Science Officer of the USS ''Enterprise''. It is assumed that another mission of exploration followed this event, however this has yet to be established into [[canon (fiction)|canon]].<br/>+The game's [[catchphrase]] in the English versions of the franchise used to be “Gotta catch 'em all!”, although it is now no longer officially used. Some still use the catchphrase.<br/> <br/>-A number of years later, the ''Enterprise'' was assigned as a training vessel under [[Starfleet Academy]].  Spock was promoted to [[Captain]] and assigned as the Commanding Officer of the USS ''Enterprise'' as Kirk had reverted to his former rank of [[Admiral]] in [[Starfleet Command]]. In 2282, Spock was temporarily relieved of command during the Genesis Crisis (''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]''), when Admiral James T. Kirk took command of the ''Enterprise'' as per Starfleet regulations in order to investigate an emergency situation surrounding the [[Regula I]] scientific research space station, but ultimately resulting in combat with the exiled tyrannt [[Khan Noonien Singh]]. During the final battle, Spock entered a [[radioactive]] [[antimatter]] control chamber without a protective suit.  He performed this heroic deed in order to return the ship's [[Warp drive|warp]] engines to service just barely in time to allow the ''Enterprise'' to escape the explosion of the [[Project Genesis|Genesis Device]].  While the planet Genesis was created, Spock died.<br/>+==Generations==<!-- Please don't delete/rename this header; it is linked to from a number of places --><br/>+All of the licensed Pokémon properties overseen by the Pokémon Company are divided roughly by generation. There have been four generations, defined by the Pokémon which appear therein. Each of these generations has been first introduced in a pair of Pokémon video games for the [[Game Boy]] or its successors (including the [[Nintendo DS]]), beginning with [[Pokémon Red and Blue|''Pokémon Red'' and ''Blue'']]. Each generation introduces a slew of new Pokémon and a handful of new general concepts, usually without replacing any old Pokémon or concepts.<br/> <br/>-== Rebirth ==<br/>-It was later discovered that Spock had transferred his [[Katra (Star Trek)|katra]], or spiritual essence, to the brain of a shipmate, Dr. [[Leonard McCoy]], at death.  In an honorary [[space burial]] Spock's body was enclosed in a torpedo and fired onto the rapidly forming Genesis planet (the work of the Genesis terraforming project). As the planet's gravitational fields were still in flux, the torpedo soft-landed. Spock's dead cells were "regenerated" by the Genesis Wave. Spock's body was actually "re-born" on the planet. It was later recovered and his katra returned to it in ''[[Star Trek III: The Search for Spock]]''. (The nature of the katra was further explored in ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]''; see the main article on [[Vulcans]] for more about the katra.)<br/>+These generations are roughly chronological divisions by release; a handful of Pokémon from a subsequent generation appear in the [[Pokémon (anime)|anime]], manga, or [[Pokémon (card game)|trading card game]] before the main Game Boy games which demarcate the generation are released, but the anime, manga, and even (of late) the card game divides itself into sagas or generations by the same scheme as the games.<br/> <br/>-Following Spock's rebirth, he completed an accelerated training program and was reinstated as a Captain in Starfleet. (Although never explained on screen, it is assumed that Spock's original personality and memories from his katra somehow reasserted themselves following a brief period of disorientation and [[amnesia]].)  In 2286, after the "Whale Song Incident", he was assigned as the Executive Officer of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-A)| USS ''Enterprise'' (NCC-1701-A)]] (''[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]]''), although he retained the rank of captain.  Spock remained as the ''Enterprise'' Executive Officer for the next seven years.  During this time, he participated in an historic journey to the center of the galaxy (''[[Star Trek V: The Final Frontier]]'') and also was a key figure in forming the lasting alliance with the [[klingon|Klingon Empire]] (''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country]]'').<br/>+Some of the general concepts were introduced elsewhere, before being introduced in the games. Two-on-two battles appeared in the anime long before appearing in the games, and Pokémon Abilities are similar to Pokémon Powers, introduced long before in the [[Pokémon (card game)|Pokémon Trading Card Game]].<br/> <br/>-== Later life ==<br/>-Sometime after the decommissioning of the [[NCC (Star Trek)|NCC]]-1701-A, Spock retired from Starfleet service and focused on diplomacy.  It was during this time that he publicly challenged his father's position on the [[Cardassian]]s, which was considered controversial.  These events were explored in the non-canon graphic novella ''Star Trek: Enter the Wolves''.<br/>+===First (“[[Game Boy]]”) generation===<br/>+Started with [[Pokémon Red and Blue|''Pokémon Red'' and ''Blue'']]. The 1st generation introduced the original 151 Pokémon, as well as the basic concepts of trading and battling Pokémon. In Japan, the first generation included ''Pokémon Red'', ''[[Pokémon Green|Green]]'', and later ''Blue'', while other regions started with ''Red'' and ''Blue'', but never got a ''Green''. This generation was completed by the game ''[[Pokémon Yellow|Pokémon Yellow: Special Pikachu Edition]]'', loosely based upon the anime, in which the player started with a [[Pikachu]] who refused to go into its [[Poké Ball]].<br/> <br/>-His activities and whereabouts over the next 70-75 years are as yet unrevealed, but Spock apparently took a wife during this time (Jean-Luc Picard once remarked that he'd attended the wedding of Sarek's son).  The non-canon novel ''Vulcan's Heart'' features the marriage of Spock and [[Saavik]].<br/>+These versions of the games revolved around the country of [[Kanto (Pokémon)|Kanto]]. This generation also introduced the idea of a rival trainer whom the player faced a number of times, as well as a team of evil Pokémon trainers; however, ''Pokémon Red'' and ''Blue'' focus on the entire mostly-faceless organization of [[Team Rocket]], while besides the normal [[Team Rocket]] trainers, Jessie, James, and Meowth (also recurring characters from the anime) also appear only in ''Pokémon Yellow''.<br/> <br/>-In 2368, Spock was seen outside his then-role as [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] ambassador on the [[Romulan]] homeworld of [[Romulus and Remus (Star Trek)|Romulus]].  He was attempting to bring about a peace between the Romulans and Vulcans, healing a rift between the two peoples that had lasted for thousands of years. (''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' [[Unification (TNG episode)|"Unification Parts I and II"]])  It's possible that his work may have been responsible for the improving relations between the Federation and the Romulans (''[[Star Trek Nemesis]]''), however nothing has been established in canon as yet.<br/>+These games were compatible with the N64 game ''[[Pokémon Stadium]]''.<br/> <br/>-In the novel ''[[Captain's Blood]]'', Spock stages his own mock assassination at a peace rally on Romulus following the events of ''Nemesis'' in a effort to play himself off as a martyr for the cause of Romulan-Vulcan reunification and exploit the unstable Romulan political climate to succeed in reunifying the Vulcans, Romulans, and Remans.<br/>+Remakes of the first two games, called ''Pokémon FireRed'' and ''Pokémon LeafGreen'', were released in the 3rd “Advance” generation.<br/> <br/>-[[Image:Tv_guide_50_greatest.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Spock was named one of the 50 greatest TV characters ever by ''TV Guide''.]]<br/>+===Second (“GBC”) generation===<br/>+Beginning with [[Pokémon Gold and Silver|''Pokémon Gold'' and ''Silver'']], this generation introduced an additional one hundred Pokémon, the “Mystery Gift” function with the [[Game Boy Color|GBC]]'s IR port, customization of the protagonist's bedroom, the ability to pick [[List of Pokémon items#Berry|Berries]] with healing properties, and Apricorns which could then be given to a character who would fashion them into custom [[Poké Ball]]s, as well as the concepts of equipping Pokémon with items, Pokémon genders, breeding Pokémon, [[List of Baby Pokémon|baby Pokémon]] and wild (random placement) one-per-game Pokémon such as [[Suicune]], [[Entei (Pokémon)|Entei]] and [[Raikou (Pokémon)|Raikou]] (3 new Legendary Pokémon), which would appear randomly around the newly created land of [[Johto]]. The games also introduced two new types of Pokémon, the [[:Category:Steel Pokémon|Steel]] and [[:Category:Dark Pokémon|Dark]] types.<br/> <br/>-== Abilities ==<br/>-Various episodes of ''TOS'' revealed different facets of Spock's personality and abilities. For example, "[[The Omega Glory]]" revealed that Spock had the ability to exercise limited control over the minds of others&mdash;an ability never again exhibited by any Vulcan. This, combined with Spock's ability to transfer his [[Katra (Star Trek)|katra]], has led some to speculate that Spock possessed more advanced mental and psychic abilities than average Vulcans. ''TOS'' also revealed that Spock is an accomplished musician, adept at playing a form of Vulcan [[harp]]. He also (in "[[Requiem for Methuselah]]") displayed advanced knowledge of [[european classical music|classical music]]. He also possessed enthusiasm for [[three-dimensional chess]].<br/>+The game also featured the newly created [[Pokégear]] which consisted of<br/>+*A [[mobile phone]] to communicate with in-game trainers for conversation or the potential of a rematch<br/>+*A [[radio]], where the radio station chosen would influence the rate at which the player encountered wild Pokémon. There is also a station stating where certain Pokémon could be found.<br/>+*A watch function including time and day of the week and the ability to change between Summer Time or Mean Time. This feature is also related to the appearance and evolution of Pokémon on specific days and times, and is part of a Day and Night system in which the sun shone from 6am to 6pm, but from 6pm to 6am the land became dark. <br/> <br/>-===Vulcan Nerve Pinch===<br/>-Spock popularised the '''[[Vulcan nerve pinch]]'''.  This manoeuvre renders most humans and humanoids unconscious by applying pressure at pressure points at the shoulder, neck or faces of humans.  The '''Vulcan Death Grip''' was a more extreme version used by Spock in the episode "The Enterprise Incident" where it apparently killed an insane Kirk.  However it was actually a ruse to allow Kirk to feign death and then surreptitiously steal the cloaking device from the Romulan flagship, so it is unknown if the Vulcan Death Grip actually exists, as it has not been used by any Vulcan before or since.  The fact that Spock later denied the existence of the Death Grip would seem to indicate that it does not.<br/>+This generation of the games was completed by ''[[Pokémon Crystal]]'', which was most notably the only GBC-exclusive Pokémon RPG and the first which allowed the player to choose the protagonist's sex. It was also the first to feature Pokémon who would do a battle dance when encountered, and signposts indicating the entering of a route, town and occasionally building or cave. ''Crystal'' version also featured a slight alteration of the encounter with the 3 Legendary Pokémon, in which the player would eventually encounter Suicune and be able to catch it. However, the other two still had to be found in the normal way.<br/> <br/>-===Mind meld===<br/>-Spock famously performed a [[mind meld]] on a number of occasions to communicate with a creature that did not speak the universal language, or to delve more deeply into another's subconscious so as to retrieve important information not otherwise accessible.  This technique involved placing his fingers at key points on the face (or equivalent thereof) of the being in question.  After a moment,  his consciousness was merged with the consciousness of the being, thus leading to thoughts and emotions being shared by both.<br/>-==The Mirror Spock==<br/>-[[Image:STMirrorMirror.jpg|thumb|left|[[James T. Kirk|Captain Kirk]] with the mirror [[Mr. Spock|Spock]] in ''[[Mirror, Mirror (TOS episode)|Mirror, Mirror]]'']]<br/>-In the [[mirror universe]], '''Spock''' was [[first officer]] of the [[ISS Enterprise|ISS ''Enterprise'']] in [[23rd century|2267]].  Like his counterpart, Spock was a logical being who was loyal to his captain, [[James T. Kirk]], and chose to warn him when he was ordered by the [[Terran Empire]] to kill him and take command if he did not launch an attack against the Halkans in retribution for their refusal to negotiate with the Empire.<br/>+These games were compatible with ''[[Pokémon Stadium 2]]'' (with the exception of Crystal).<br/> <br/>-Based on his captain's apparently erratic behavior, Spock correctly deduced that Kirk had actually been accidentally replaced by his counterpart from our universe, and devised a means of returning [[James T. Kirk|Kirk]], [[Montgomery Scott|Scotty]], [[Leonard McCoy|McCoy]], and [[Uhura]] to their original ship.<br/>+===Third (“Advance(d)”) generation===<br/>+Starting over by hearkening back to ''Red'' and ''Blue'', [[Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pokémon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']] added another 135 Pokémon from the [[Hoenn]] region, as well as Pokémon natures (30 distinct Pokémon personality types), [[Pokémon Abilities]] (always-on special innate abilities), [[Pokéblock]]s and [[Pokémon Contest]]s , and two-on-two Pokémon battles. However, this generation saw the loss of the Night and Day system, although the time mechanic did exist to the extent that a clock appeared and that certain Pokémon would only evolve into certain Pokémon at specific times of the day or night. These versions also introduced the ability to grow berries in certain places, each which had set lengths of time for their flowering, and the ability to make “Secret Bases” in trees or caves in which dolls, tables, chairs, plants, and other objects could be placed.<br/> <br/>-Before Kirk left, believing that Spock would one day become captain of the ''Enterprise'', he planted a seed of doubt about the inevitability of the Empire, asking Spock if violence was the only logical answer.  Spock promised to consider Kirk's words.<br/>+The third game in this series was ''[[Pokémon Emerald]]'', which updated the [[PokéNAV]]'s Trainers Eyes feature for a return to the mobile phone system of the previous generation (but modified, allowing players to contact [[Pokémon Gym]] Leaders for rematches, but no longer allowing them to remove [[Non-player character|NPC]] trainers). ''Emerald'' version also saw a return of the Pokémon battle dance when encountering an enemy Pokémon. These 3 versions all appeared on the [[Game Boy Advance]]. The ''Emerald'' version also shipped with the [[GBA wireless adapter]] for wireless battles.<br/> <br/>-As Kirk predicted, Spock later on became the captain of the ''Enterprise''.  Spock used the ship as a power base to accumulate influence, and eventually rose to become leader of the Terran Empire.  He instituted major reforms, turning the Empire into a more peaceful and less aggressive power.  Unfortunately, Spock's reforms left the Empire unprepared to fight the united [[Klingon-Cardassian Alliance]], who conquered the entire Terran Empire, enslaving the [[Terran]]s themselves as well as the [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcans]].<br/>+This generation was rounded out on handhelds by [[Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen|''Pokémon FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen'']] for the [[Game_Boy_Advance|GBA]], [[enhanced remake]]s of the first two Pokémon games, including a playable female character (based on concept art for a playable female the original designers considered but were unable to implement), new items and regions, move tutors, and all the features of the 2nd and 3rd generations, excluding the day/night system and (except in Japan) e-reader compatibility.<br/> <br/>-The Mirror Spock’s [[goatee]] entered [[folklore]] and has now become synonymous with [[evil twin]]s and [[parallel universe]]s. The progressive rock band [[Spock's Beard]] was named after this and in an episode of [[South Park]] [[Cartman]]'s ''good'' twin appeared wearing a goatee.<br/>+All five GBA games are compatible the storage program [[Pokémon Box: Ruby & Sapphire]] for [[Nintendo GameCube]], and also with [[Pokémon Colosseum]] and [[Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness]]. The first Pokémon RPGs for home consoles, these titles introduced the desert country of [[Orre]], as well as corrupted [[shadow Pokémon]], and “Snag”ging, the ability to steal/rescue them from their trainers and eventually “purify” them.<br/> <br/>-== Trivia ==<br/>-* In popular culture, particularly among non-fans of the series, Mr. Spock is often misnamed Dr. Spock and is confused with the real-life physician Dr. [[Benjamin Spock]]. Trek creator [[Gene Roddenberry]] denied that he named the character after the real-life Spock; he was simply looking for an alien-sounding name. The ''Star Trek'' novel ''[[Strangers from the Sky]]'' is one of the only works associated with the franchise to make direct reference to Benjamin Spock when Spock is actually given the name "Ben Spock" by an elderly man during a visit to the 21st century.<br/>+===Fourth generation===<br/>+Slated to be introduced in ''[[Pokémon Ranger]]: the Road to [[Pokémon Diamond and Pearl|Diamond and Pearl]]'' for the [[Nintendo DS]]. A handful of new Pokémon from this generation have made cameo appearances in the seventh and eighth Pokémon movies (''[[Pokémon: Destiny Deoxys]]'' and ''[[Mew and the Wave Guiding Hero: Lucario]]'', respectively), as well as ''[[Pokémon XD]]'' and ''[[Pokémon Mysterious Dungeon]] Blue & Red''. In addition, the anime has also featured the capture of three out of the five currently known fourth generation Pokémon. The known fourth generation Pokémon are: [[Manyula]] (evolution of [[Sneasel]]), [[Bonsly]] (pre-evolution of [[Sudowoodo]]), [[Lucario]], [[Manene]] (pre-evolution of [[Mr. Mime]]), and [[Munchlax]] (pre-evolution of [[Snorlax]]). Popular Japanese magazine [[Coro Coro]] has stated that their mid-February issue will reveal a new Pokémon, most likely one that will be related to the new movie, ''[[Pokémon Ranger and the Prince of the Sea]]'', as there has been debate over whether the “Prince of the Sea” is actually the only Pokémon (other than Pikachu) so far guaranteed to appear in the film, [[Kyogre]].<br/> <br/>-* Many fans believe that Spock is the first [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcan]] to join [[Starfleet]], a fact that appears to be contradicted by the series ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]''; in fact, there is no reference to Spock being the first.  It has been suggested that he is the first to graduate from [[Starfleet Academy]], however.  Note: some official documentation from [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] such as the [http://www.startrek.com startrek.com] website support the first-Vulcan-in-Starfleet theory, as do some original Trek novels, however these sources are not considered [[Canon (fiction)|canon]]: only what is shown on screen is considered canon in the Star Trek universe. There is also some uncertainty whether the Starfleet seen in ''Enterprise'' is the same entity seen in ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' and later series.<br/>+==Video games==<br/>+[[Image:PokemonRed.JPG|thumb|right|A screenshot from one of the first Pokémon games, ''[[Pokémon Red]]''.]] <br/>+{{main|Pokémon (video games)}}<br/> <br/>-* The ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' episode, "[[Two Days and Two Nights (ENT episode)|Two Days and Two Nights]]" reveals that Spock's grandfather, [[Skon]], created an English-language translation of [[Surak]]'s writings. Sub-Commander [[T'Pol]] gives Captain [[Jonathan Archer]] a copy of this book as a gift in this episode.<br/>+The original ''Pokémon'' games were Japanese [[computer role-playing game|RPG]]s with an element of [[strategy]], and were created by [[Satoshi Tajiri]] for the [[Game Boy]]. These role-playing games (and their sequels, remakes and English language translations) are still considered the “main” Pokémon games, and the games which most fans of the series are referring to when they use the term “Pokémon games.”<br/> <br/>-*Mr. Spock first appeared in the first proposed but rejected pilot episode ''[[The Cage]]'' in which he was seen serving under Captain [[Christopher Pike]]. He was depicted as more emotional than he was in the regular [[TOS]] run. The cold, logical aspect was mostly associated with [[Number One (Star Trek)|Number One]]. [[Fanon]] often speculates that Spock, in his younger years was experimenting with his human side but also looked up to Number One as well. One of the reasons this first pilot was rejected (chief reason being too cerebral), reportedly was the apprehension about Spock's outward appearance being too satanic, considering he was intended to be a main character. Ironically, Spock was the only character from the original pilot to make it into the second pilot and thus the regular series.<br/>+These games have sold over 100 million copies to date. Accumulative sold units (including home console versions) reach [http://palgn.com.au/article.php?id=3605&sid=4cea9e5e814470cb7ea6fd462d04a13e 143 million copies]. This makes it the second biggest-selling games franchise ever (after Nintendo's [[Mario]] series).<br/> <br/>-*Several stages of Spock's life, from childhood to adulthood, are shown in the film [[Star Trek III: The Search for Spock]]. This marks the only film in which actors other than [[Leonard Nimoy]] have played the character. During this film, he is played by [[Carl Steven]] (age 9), [[Vadia Potenza]] (age 13), [[Stephen Manley]] (age 17), and Joe W. Davis (age 25). Due to his rapid aging and the pain associated with it, the young Spock is often heard screaming; these screams were recorded by [[Frank Welker]].<br/>+The first games in the series were [[Pokémon Red and Blue|''Pokémon Red'' and ''Blue''']] (''Red'' and ''Green'' in Japan, followed by a ''Blue'', and a special edition ''Yellow'' version). These games were nearly identical, save for the fact that each version had a select group of Pokémon that the other version did not. The ultimate goal of these games was to catch at least one member of all the different species of Pokémon (151, though the 151st could only be caught in-game in the Japanese version), and to do so, players had to trade for Pokémon not available in the version they had. While battling monsters is nothing new to RPGs, many players found themselves nearly addicted to finding, fighting, and capturing every Pokémon in the game. Another, perhaps easier, goal was to finish the game's storyline by becoming the Pokémon League Champion. This was done by collecting eight [[Pokémon Gym|Gym]] Badges by beating the eight ''Gym Leaders'' and then defeating the [[Elite Four]], plus the current League Champion.<br/> <br/>-*The [[Futurama]] character Dr. Zoidberg was inspired by the show's creators wondering how Spock must have felt being treated by a doctor of another species.  <br/>+Each generation of Pokémon games so far has followed a pattern of two complementing versions followed later by at least one other version with some extras. Pokémon ''[[Pokémon Red and Blue|Red]]'' and ''[[Pokémon Red and Blue|Blue]]'' were followed by ''[[Pokémon Yellow]]'' (in Japan, Red and Green were followed by Blue which was subsequently followed by Yellow). ''[[Pokémon Gold and Silver|Gold]]'' and ''[[Pokémon Gold and Silver|Silver]]'' were followed by the exclusively [[Game Boy Color]] version, ''[[Pokémon Crystal|Crystal]]''. The [[Game Boy Advance]] first saw the release of ''[[Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire|Ruby]]'' and ''[[Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire|Sapphire]]''. The most recent full fledged game has been ''[[Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen|FireRed]]'' and ''[[Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen|LeafGreen]]'' which are remakes of Red and Blue. A third version of Ruby and Sapphire, called ''[[Pokémon Emerald]]'', was released on [[May 1]], [[2005]].<br/> <br/>-== See also ==<br/>-* [[Spock and Data]]<br/>+The series has also diversified into various spin-offs, such as [[pinball]] games, [[virtual pet]]s, simulated [[photography]], and [[racing]]. A handful of these spinoffs are remade in subsequent “generations”; for example, ''[[Pokémon Pinball: Ruby and Sapphire]]'' is very similar to ''[[Pokémon Pinball]]'' but with newer Pokémon, and ''[[Pokémon Stadium 2]]'' is largely identical to ''[[Pokémon Stadium]]'' but for the compatibility with [[Pokémon Gold and Silver|''Pokémon Gold'' and ''Silver'']].<br/> <br/>-==External links==<br/>-{{wikiquote}}<br/>-* {{memoryalpha article|Spock|Mr. Spock}}<br/>-* {{memoryalpha article|Spock%28mirror%29|Mirror Universe Mr. Spock}}<br/>-* [http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/series/TOS/character/1112508.html StarTrek.com: Spock]<br/>-{{start box}}<br/>-{{succession box | title=[[Starship Enterprise|Captain of the Starship Enterprise]] | before=[[Willard Decker]] | after=[[ James T.

Pikachu appeared as an initially available character while Jigglypuff was an unlockable one. The pair returned in the 2001 [[GameCube]] sequel, ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]''. They kept their positions, Pikachu was still an initial character while Jigglypuff was still an unlockable character, but two new Pokémon also appeared (joining Jigglypuff as unlockable characters: [[Mewtwo]] and [[Pichu]].)<br/>+<br/>+In both games, many different Pokémon can be used in a match by throwing the Pokéball item. A randomly-chosen Pokémon is released from the Pokéball, using one of its attacks to affect other players.<br/>+<br/>+In ''Super Smash Bros. Melee'', the player can collect many different trophies of a variety of characters from numerous Nintendo games, including several Pokémon characters.<br/>+<br/>+Nintendo has also stated that a version of Super Smash Bros. will appear on their forthcoming codenamed [[Nintendo Revolution]] console, tentatively titled [[Super Smash Bros. Revolution]]/DX. Whilst the appearence of any Pokémon characters has not been explicitly confirmed, they are highly likely to be featured in the game (considering the abundance of Pokémon references in the first two games in the series).<br/>+<br/>+===Pokémon on the Nintendo Revolution===<br/>+A ''Pokémon'' game for the new [[Nintendo Revolution]] has currently not been announced by [[Nintendo]]. However, [[Nintendo]] has produced a demo for the [[Nintendo Revolution]] (exclusive only to major game related companies such as [[GameSpot]] and [[IGN]]) known as the “Big Pokémon Hunter” game where the goal was to zoom with the controller and find different ''Pokémon''. The review of this demo is currently available at [http://hardware.gamespot.com/Story-ST-15143-2567-x-x-x&body_pagenum=2 GameSpot] as well as many other sites.<br/>+<br/>+==Anime series==<br/>+[[Image:hoenn-group ash may brock max.jpg|thumb|right|The main characters of the ''Advanced Generation'' anime.]]<br/>+{{main|Pokémon (anime)}}<br/>+<br/>+There are several ''Pokémon'' anime series based on the video games. <br/>+<br/>+===The Original Series===<br/>+The first, and the most familiar, is ''Pocket Monsters'' or simply ''Pokémon'' (often referred to as ''Pokémon: Gotta Catch Em All'' to distinguish it from the later series), which details the adventures of [[Ash Ketchum]] as he travels through Kanto, the Orange Islands, and Johto on a quest to become the greatest Pokémon Master of all time. This series is based on the first and second generation games. Accompanying Ash on his journeys were [[Brock (Pokémon)|Brock]], the [[Pewter City]] Gym Leader; [[Misty (Pokémon)|Misty]], the youngest of the Gym Leaders sisters from [[Cerulean City]]; and [[Tracey Sketchit]], an artist and “Pokémon watcher”.<br/>+In the original series Ash's main rival was another trainer from [[Pallet Town]], [[Gary Oak]]. Gary (whose grandfather was none other than [[Professor Oak]], the man in charge of giving new trainers their first Pokémon) was well known and acompanied by a squad of [[cheerleader]]s. The names of Ash and Gary were derived from the characters' Japanese names, Satoshi and Shigeru. These names, in turn, were taken from the two people who produced the franchise - Pokémon creator Satoshi Tajiri and gaming legend [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], who helped Tajiri to launch the series.<br/>+<br/>+===“Advanced Generation”===<br/>+The saga continues into ''Pocket Monsters Advanced Generation'' (in Japan) where Ash and company travel to [[Hoenn]], a southern region in the Pokémon World. Ash catches a Snorunt, a Treecko, and a Tailow, all of which evolve: Snorunt into Glalie, Treecko into Grovyle and Tailow into Swellow. Ash takes on the role of a teacher and mentor for a beginner Pokémon trainer in this series named [[May (Pokémon)|May]]. Her brother [[Max (Pokémon)|Max]] accompanies them, and though he isn't a trainer, he knows massive amounts of handy information. Brock (from the original series) soon catches up with Ash, but Misty has returned to [[Cerulean City]] to tend to her duties as a gym leader. This series is based on the third generation games.<br/>+<br/>+Afterward, Ash goes back to his home region of Kanto and visits new areas around there with the current team. Misty meets with them through this part of the journey as they go to the Kanto [[Pokémon Contest|contest]]s and the [[Battle Frontier]]. This part of the series is loosely based upon [[Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen|Pokémon FireRed, LeafGreen]], and [[Pokémon Emerald|Emerald]].<br/>+<br/>+===Spin-off Series===<br/>+A spin-off series, entitled ''Shu-kan Pokémon Ho-so-kyoku'' (also referred to as ''Pokémon Hoso'') is a spinoff of the first, and tells the adventures within the continuity of ''Pocket Monsters Advanced Generation'', starring many of the recurring characters in ''Pocket Monsters''. The English adaptation of this series, ''[[Pokémon Chronicles]]'', combines the episodes from this series as well as various other made-for-TV specials (originally unrelated to ''Housoukyoku'') that have not previously been released in English.<br/>+<br/>+===Others===<br/>+There is also a television program in Japan titled ''[[Pokémon Sunday]]'', a live action Pokémon-themed variety show hosted by the ''Pokémon Research Team''.<br/>+<br/>+===English Language Adaptations===<br/>+In the English language release, the original series was split into four separate series spanning five seasons while ''Advanced Generation'' was split into separate series. Two series from ''Advanced Generation'' have been aired, with the third series currently airing in the United States and elsewhere.<br/>+<br/>+The English adaptation can be seen on [[Kids WB]] in the United States. In other countries the English language adaptations air on the following channels:<br/>+*[[YTV]] in [[Canada]]<br/>+*[[Toonami (UK)|Toonami UK]] in the [[United Kingdom]]<br/>+*[[RTÉ Two]] in [[Ireland]]<br/>+*[[RTL 2]] in [[Germany]]<br/>+*[[TF1]] and [[Jetix]] in [[France]]<br/>+*[[MediaCorp TV12 Central|Kids Central]] in [[Singapore]]<br/>+*[[Channel Ten]]'s [[Cheez TV]] and [[Cartoon Network]]/[[Toonami]] in [[Australia]]<br/>+''Housoukyoku'' originally aired on [[TV Tokyo]] but has since ended its run. Whilst ''[[Pokémon Chronicles|Chronicles]]'' can be seen on [[YTV]] in [[Canada]] and in the [[United Kingdom]] on [[Toonami (UK)|Toonami UK]] (as of [[May 2005]]), ''Pokémon Sunday'' can only be seen on [[TV Tokyo]].<br/>+<br/>+==Card game==<br/>+[[image:pokemoncard.gif|right|thumb|A typical Pokémon card]]<br/>+{{main|Pokémon (card game)}}<br/>+<br/>+The Pokémon Trading Card Game is a [[collectible card game]] based on Pokémon, first introduced to North America in 1999, and in Japan at an earlier date. Initially, it was published by [[Wizards of the Coast]], the company most famous for ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]''.<br/>+<br/>+However, with the release of ''[[Pokémon Ruby]]'' and ''[[Pokémon Sapphire|Sapphire]]'' [[Game Boy]] [[video games]], [[Nintendo]] took back the card game from Wizards of the Coast and started publishing the cards themselves. With the “Expedition” expansion, they introduced the '''Pokémon-e Trading Card Game''', the cards in which (for the most part) are compatible with the Nintendo [[e-Reader]]. Nintendo discontinued its production of e-Reader compatible cards with the release of EX FireRed & LeafGreen.<br/>+<br/>+In 1998, Nintendo released a [[Game Boy Color]] version of the trading card game in Japan. It was also released in the US and Europe in 2000.

You have said that Wikipedia is the place of polite and thoughtful people.  I'd like to ask, what is polite and thoughtful about perpetuating the dissemination of these cartoons.

But I believe that too often people use the cry of freedom of the press as a means of rationalizing away their complete disregard for their fellow human beings.  I think that the reaction to Muslim outrage over the publication of these cartoons (i.e., increasing their publication world-wide) is tantamount to the worst kind of arrogance and self-absorption.

Publishing comics is far from a "complete disregard".  If you really were for freedom of the press you'd understand that the press is not free when religious prohibitions trump their free speech.  It's not a good idea to censor the press against saying anything possibly bad about religion.  You want a quick example?  If no one had reported on the Catholic priest scandal it would probably still be going on to this day.  And enough is enough when, finally, Muslims settle down and realize that freedom of speech means things can be published that they may find offensive, but rather than over-react to it, they should just ignore it.  And by the way this is isn't the place to be having these discussions, so I shan't continue any longer.  I'm sure various forums or Usenet groups would more than welcome these interchanges.  --<font style="background: #000000" face="Impact" color="#00a5ff">[[User:Cyde|Cyde Weys]]</font> 17:00, 6 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-The publication of the images on Wikipedia has been extensively discussed and polled.

The word is most often used with positive connotations - which I think is the case here. An example is that somebody may wish for a "modspil" (in the meaning "more active/committed role") from their spouse / loved one, from a business partner, or - in this case - in a dialogue. The term impplies that you can't have a dialogue / exchange between one position and nothing else. You need two positions, then you can start have a fruitful dialogue.

However, let me just say that as a Christian I know that the Old Testament had various things to say about making graven images of God - none of them good. I can understand where they are coming from, even if I don't agree with it. The problem, of course, with this whole argument is that Islam categorically rejects post-moderism in that they believe that images of Mohammed ''do'' in fact cause offense, and are therefore objectively an attack on Islam. Post-moderism, with its belief that the human experience is subjective and that therefore objective truth is an illusion, is totally contrary. Personally, I'd never base my argument on post-modernism, considering that when one argues that a belief is objectively wrong it strikes me as futile to use a philosophy that states there is no such thing as objective truth (which, incidently, is an objective truth).  - [[User:Ta bu shi da yu|Ta bu shi da yu]] 12:44, 6 February 2006 (UTC) <br/>-::::::::Why is worshipping a lego man ridiculous?

Well done Wikipedia.  There is something that I, as a non-Muslim (a Brianist, in fact) would like more information on, to help me understand how Muslims feel about this.  As far as I can tell, there are a number of different reasons why the cartoons and their publications are upsetting and/or offensive to Muslims/Islam.  These can probably be summarised as 1) The depiction of of human beings, and Muhammed in particular, is forbidden by Islamic tradition.  2) Some of the cartoons depict Muhammed lasciviously.  3) Some of the cartoons depict Muhammed as condoning or participating in terrorism.  4) That the supposed Western tradition of "freedom of speech" is being used to justify the publication of these cartoons in a way that, say, anti-Semitic cartoons would not be tolerated.  5) That the combination of some or all of the above represents a growing Islamophobia in the West.  If some genuine Muslims could respond with a short, simple description of how much each of the points above applies to them, then with a number of responses we could perhaps direct the debate a bit better to the most contentious parts of the issue?

Typically in Wikipedia, when people have objectede images that some may find offensive are further down the page, if they are on the page at all.  For example the articles [[penis]], [[breasts]].  It seems to me that a significant minority of people are quite genuine that they find these images offensive.  Personally I don't get it, I can't see anything any more offensive here than in a children's comic - they are only satirical cartoons.  However as there are those that are genuinely very offended, I don't understand why there would be opposition to at least moving the images further down the page.  I realise that there was already a vote on this, however I think the vote was ended prematurely - and it would appear my last comments on this subject were archived within minutes of me making them!

My concern is that the poll on location was ended prematurely.  I don't think that a debate on the location of the article should have been held in concert with the debate on removal, as I don't think it yielded a fair result.  I don't think we obtained consensus on it, despite the 70% in favour, as the vote was not held over a long enough period of time - it was open for less than 48 hours, yet 7-days is more typical on Wikipedia.  While I think the issue of whether the image should be on the page or not, has been clearly resolved, I think the location issue should be subjected to further debate, and perhaps a new poll.  But, rather than open the poll, I was looking for dicussion first.  And none of the responses to my comment have entered discussion.  So the question is given that many people appear to be genuinely offended by the image, why would we not at least show some sensitivity and move the image further down, in the same manner that we have done on other pages? [[User:Nfitz|Nfitz]] 02:53, 6 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-::Why should we respect the feelings of those who were offended, but not of those who were not offended? Also, I don't think that the poll was ended prematurely. It's true that a lot less people voted in the poll on the location of the cartoon than in the poll on the presence of the cartoon. However, there was a clear difference. The "top of the page" option got 70% of the votes. The second most popular option got only 16% of the votes, IIRC correctly. I doubt that the result would have been much different if the poll had remained open longer.

So I don't think the poll on the position of the cartoon should be regarded as permanently binding. Perhaps at some point we should bring poll 2 back out and reopen it to voting. Finally, Jtkiefer, you're work on this page (and talkpage) has been great, but I think you're overreacting to Dmaftei here.

It can be argued that the intent of these cartoons is humor, and the much delayed reaction   from some Islamic groups was the opposite violence.

[[User:Carson_Lam|Carson]].[[User_talk:Carson_Lam|talk]] 02:34, 7 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-:::From my reading, the intent of the cartoons was to illustrate an article about self-censorship for fear of causing exactly the type of reaction which occurred. I believe humour may have been a secondary consideration in this case. It would also have been extremely naive of the editor to not expect some sort of backlash. What he probably didn't expect was for a touring party to take them to the Muslim world. Given that was what happened, the outcome was to be expected. Also, from what I gather the objection on the whole is the fact that images were made at all, not that some of them could be construed as implying violence and hatred. I take your point on the paradox but I think there is a different term for what is going on there.

I'll see if I can find a place to put it. [[User:Joturner|joturner]] 06:03, 7 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-: I added the table to the article. It's huge, but I tried to make it take up as little space as possible. I'll leave it up to the rest of the Wikipedia community to do what it thinks is right. However, I do believe it provides important information, even if it goes on a separate page where it would be eating up a lot of space. [[User:Joturner|joturner]] 06:18, 7 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-Thanks for that, your table is great.

Question : According to http://media.guardian.co.uk/site/story/0,,1700798,00.html the BBC has shown the pictures. Is perhaps noting that they have been broadcasted in the news relevant even if they are not printed?[[User:DanielDemaret|DanielDemaret]] 09:30, 7 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-[[User:Hephaestion|Hephaestion]] 10:10, 7 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-Another update, the two related, small Jordanian papers, which carried the cartoons, carried 3 cartoons each.  The editors of both papers were arrested, but apparently released although I can not see any verification of the release other then the Der Spiegel article.  Waiting for Reporters with Borders to verify release, so I have changed the table to reflect 3 cartoons each for the Jordanian papers.  I have also removed the orginal table I put up as your table is sufficient.<br/>-<br/>-Also Norways's Dagbladet published all 12 cartoons on January 10th 2006 so I ammended that as well.<br/>-<br/>-We have reports on CNN, BBC or other key sources that newspapers in Japan, Romania, Ukraine and Brazil have also published the cartoons, can anybody please give details of which paper, which date and how many cartoons for these 4 countries and any others.<br/>-<br/>-== Schoolboy picture ==<br/>-In the description of the cartoon with the schoolboy it states that the text of his shirt reads: "Fremtiden" (the future). This may be overinterpreted a bit, wanting the cartoon to be  prophetic. I think it is more like to be a play with words. His shirts is clearly the uniform of the local football (soccer) team from Valby: "Frem". Should we change the description to capture this.... ? [[User:Kjaergaard|Kjaergaard]] 05:44, 7 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-: Yes - I didn't notice that, and most other people certainly neither. I don't have a suggestion as to what should be written instead, though. [[User:Dybdahl|Dybdahl]] 09:54, 7 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-==14 Archives?==<br/>-Is there a Cliff's notes version?  I've been away for a bit.  Any new polls?  --[[User:JGGardiner|JGGardiner]] 06:44, 7 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-:I'd say little of significance has happened since the two (...or three...) original polls closed. No new polls, thank [[His Noodly Appendage]]. Fine tuning the article, adding recent developments, the occasional tangential shouting match in talk. [[User:Weregerbil|Weregerbil]] 09:35, 7 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-==Other reasons?==<br/>-Several television and newspaper [[editorial]]s suggested some orchestrating of events. More to the point, it has been noted that in Syria and other less democratic countries, it is almost impossible to demonstrate, especially against the government. But now, without any problems buildings are burned. Commentators think this is a not-inconveniant distraction for [[Syria]], which is in the middle of the [[Hariri#UN_Investigation|Hariri]] investigation. Has anybody heard this too, and should it be mentioned? --[[Image:Flag_of_the_Netherlands.svg|25px|Holland]] [[User:Nescio|Nomen Nescio]] 07:10, 7 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-It was mentioned on the Canadian (CBC) news as well that some in Lebanon suggested that Syria was behind the violence there.  --[[User:JGGardiner|JGGardiner]] 07:14, 7 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-: Last weekend I read in "Sydsvenska Dagbladet" a researcher from the swedish military suggested the same, and on a BBC talkshow, the DOHA Debates, last weekend, Abdallah Schleifer the said the same. None of them suggest that Syria orchestrated it, but rather that it could not have been done without the tacit approval of the government there. The swedish researcher suggested that Syria had so many internal problems that they were happy to let anger vent in another direction for a bit. Did I not read that the Grand Mufti promise to rebuild all the embassies, for free, even nicer than before, somewhere?  [[User:DanielDemaret|DanielDemaret]] 08:33, 7 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-==Move cartoons down the page to reduce offense?==<br/>-I think it would be a good idea to move the picture down the page, and put a note on the top that the cartoons are listed further down the page.  That way, people looking for info on it who don't want to see the cartoon will have that option open to them.  What do you think? {{unsigned|125.63.139.116}}<br/>-<br/>-This already has been proposed. It's a frivolous solution. It's going to appear anyway; and we're not shielding children. After all, we're not endorsing the cartoons. We're just reporting it. [[User:Natalinasmpf|Elle <small><sub><font color="#CC9920">vécut heureuse</font></sub></small> <small><font color="blue"><sup>à jamais</sup></font></small>]] ([[User talk:Natalinasmpf|Be eudaimonic!]]) 08:10, 7 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-:This is not going to change anything as the cartoon will still be visible in the article. I don't think children will want to look at this kind of topics as its not their area of interest. This is a trivial matter, so is no use making a fuss over it. --[[User:Terenceong1992|Ter]][[Wikipedia:Esperanza|<font color="green">e]]</font>[[User:Terenceong1992|nc]][[User talk:Terenceong1992|e Ong]] ([[Chinese New Year greetings|恭喜发财]]) 08:15, 7 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-::Plus we've already had a poll in which 70% voted to keep it at the top.  And incase you're wondering, only 11% or so wanted to move it down. And arguing that 70% is not consensus is kinda moot, considering 11% is even less of one. -[[User:Azmaverick623|Maverick]] 08:51, 7 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-== Cleaning Up ==<br/>-I've been going through and de-wikifying terms which have been previously wikified in the article. I'm human so I believe I'm missing a few. I'm not sure which ones though. This article is huge! (Way too many things are wikified too, I think that will be my next task.) [[User:Kyaa the Catlord|Kyaa the Catlord]] 08:54, 7 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-==Cleaning up intro==<br/>-The current [[Wikipedia:Lead section|Lead section]] is not doing its job. Rather than giving a brief introduction to the subject, it is cluttered with sniplets of information like:<br/>- On 5 February, Iran announced that it was severing all trade with Denmark, effective on 6 February.<br/>-Most of this is already in the article or in the timeline. I will try to clean it up radically, if there aren'e too many objections. [[User:Eixo|Eixo]] 09:13, 7 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-:Go for it, most of the vandalism has stopped and I'm thinking its time to clean this baby up while we can. :D [[User:Kyaa the Catlord|Kyaa the Catlord]] 09:18, 7 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-"Despite the Islamic prohibition against depictions of Muhammad, in the past Muslims have created non-satirical depictions. However, many Muslims have publicly indicated that they perceive the Jyllands-Posten cartoons as implying that all Muslims are terrorists, by depicting Muhammad with a bomb and for collaborating with terrorists (by receiving them in heaven). This generalisation arises in the context of a perceived lack of religious tolerance toward Muslims, and has led to the recent escalation of the controversy. Some argue that following the global backlash by Muslims (including but not limited to the burning of foreign embassies beginning in early February 2006), the suggestion contained in the cartoons that there is an association between Islam and violence and violent acts has unfortunately been vindicated."<br/>-<br/>-Question, noone has found a source for this and it seems to be wishy washy, anyone mind if it simply goes away? I don't think it adds anything to the lead as it is written. [[User:Kyaa the Catlord|Kyaa the Catlord]] 09:56, 7 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-:Ok, I'm going to be bold. Hold on tight! [[User:Kyaa the Catlord|Kyaa the Catlord]] 10:09, 7 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-Did some editing, though it could probably need an even stricter diet. [[User:Eixo|Eixo]] 09:55, 7 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-== AE/BE standardi(z/s)ation ==<br/>-<br/>-To rehash an earlier dicussion, this article should be standardized (hey, it's a talk page and I'm from the US) to use BE. Please keep that in mind when editing. --[[User:Dante Alighieri|Dante Alighieri]] | [[User talk:Dante Alighieri|Talk]] 09:43, 7 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-: This is an international encyclopedia. There is no need to use an artificial US standard. --[[User:Valentinian|Valentinian]] 10:17, 7 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+{{oldafdfull|date=December 29, 2005|result=no consensus|votepage=Francis Muir (Second nomination)}} &mdash; [[User:JIP|<font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font>]] | [[User talk:JIP|Talk]] 05:59, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</td>

"Raag" is the modern Hindi pronunciation used by Hindustani musicians; "Ragam" the Tamil form used by Karnatak [[Carnatic music]] musicians.<br/>+Under the older system in effect before August 2000, the ''district'' was the fourth level of government. Pakistan was divided into provinces which contained administrative units called ''divisions'' which contained ''districts''. In August 2000, under the new system, the ''division'' was abolished as an administrative tier, and the provinces are directly divided into ''districts''. <br/> <br/>-A raga functions both as description and prescription.  It describes a generalized form of melodic practice; it prescribes a set of rules for how to build a [[melody]]. It specifies rules for movements up (<i>aarohanam</i> [&#2310;&#2352;&#2379;&#2361;&#2339;&#x092e;&#x094d;]) and down (<i>avarohanam</i> [&#2309;&#2357;&#2352;&#2379;&#2361;&#2339;&#x092e;&#x094d;]) the [[musical scale|scale]], which [[note (music)|notes]] should figure more and which notes should be used more sparingly, which notes may be sung with ''[[gamaka]]'', phrases to be used, phrases to be avoided, and so on.{{ref|FN1}}The result is a framework that can be used to [[musical composition|compose]] or [[improvisation|improvise]] melodies, allowing for endless variation within the set of notes.<br/>+A ''district'' is further subdivided into [[tehsil]]s ([[Town]]). Tehsils may contain villages or municipalities. There are over five thousand local governments in Pakistan. Since 2001, these have been led by democratically elected local councils, each headed by a Nazim (the word means "supervisor" in Urdu, but is sometimes translated as "mayor.") Women have been allotted a minimum of 33% seats in these councils; there is no upper limit to the number of women in these councils.<br/> <br/>-Although notes are an important part of raga practice, it by no means exhausts what a raga is.  A raga is more than a scale.  Many ragas share the same scale.<br/>+The [[Karachi District]] as it stands today was made by merging the districts of Karachi Central, Karachi East, Karachi South, Karachi West and Malir.<br/> <br/>-The underlying scale may have [[pentatonic|five]], [[hexatonic|six]] or [[heptatonic|seven tones]] made up of [[swara]]s. This provides one method of classifying ragas. Ragas that have five swaras are called <i>audava</i> (&#2324;&#2337;&#2357;) ragas; those with six, <i>shaadava</i> (&#2359;&#2366;&#2337;&#2357;); and with seven, <i>sampoorna</i> (&#2360;&#2306;&#2346;&#2370;&#2352;&#2381;&#x0923;) ([[Sanskrit]] for 'complete'). Those ragas that do not follow the strict ascending or descending order of swaras are called <i>vakra</i> (&#2357;&#2325;&#2381;&#2352;) ('crooked') ragas. <br/>-(<i>To see the order of notes, check the article on [[swara]].</i>)<br/>+== Islamabad Capital Territory ==<br/>+[[Islamabad]]<br/> <br/>-The basic mode of reference is that which is equivalent to the Western [[Ionian mode]] (this is called ''[[Bilawal]] thaat'' in Hindustani music).  All relationships between pitches follow from this basic arrangement of intervals.  In any given seven-tone mode, the second, third, sixth, and seventh notes can be [[natural]] (''shuddha'', lit. 'pure') or [[flat]] (''komal'', 'soft') but never sharped, and the fourth note can be natural or [[sharp]] (''tivra'') but never flatted, making up the twelve notes in the Western [[equal tempered]] [[chromatic scale]] (but without Western pitch equivalencies like, for example, A# and Bb). Ragas can also specify [[microtonal]] changes to this scale: a flatter second, a sharper seventh, and so forth.  Treatises from the first millennium report that the octave used to be divided theoretically into 22 microtones ("shrutis"), but by the 16th century, this practice seems to have died out.  Furthermore, individual performers treat pitches quite differently, and the precise intonation of a given note depends on melodic context.  There is no [[absolute pitch]]; instead, each performance simply picks a ground note, which also serves as the [[drone]], and the other [[scale degree]]s follow relative to the ground note.<br/>+== Districts of Balochistan ==<br/>+<table><tr><td><br/>+There are 26 districts in Balochistan.<br/> <br/>-Some Hindustani (North Indian) ragas are prescribed a time of day or a season.  During the rains, for example, many of the Malhar group of ragas--associated with the monsoon--are performed.  Some musicians take these prescriptions very seriously.  However, since the majority of concert hall performances take place in the evening and night, musicians often have to make concessions for the sake of public performance.  <br/>+<table><tr><td valign=top><br/>+* [[Awaran District|Awaran]]<br/>+* [[Barkhan District|Barkhan]]<br/>+* [[Bolan District|Bolan]]<br/>+* [[Chagai District|Chagai]]<br/>+* [[Dera Bugti District|Dera Bugti]]<br/>+* [[Gwadar District|Gwadar]]<br/>+* [[Jaffarabad District|Jaffarabad]]<br/>+* [[Jhal Magsi District|Jhal Magsi]]<br/>+* [[Kalat District|Kalat]]<br/>+* [[Kharan District|Kharan]]<br/>+* [[Kohlu District|Kohlu]]<br/>+* [[Khuzdar District|Khuzdar]]<br/>+* [[Qilla Abdullah]]<br/>+</td><td valign=top><br/>+* [[Qilla Saifullah]]<br/>+* [[Lasbela District|Lasbela]]<br/>+* [[Loralai District|Loralai]]<br/>+* [[Mastung District|Mastung]]<br/>+* [[Musakhel District|Musakhel]]<br/>+* [[Nasirabad District|Nasirabad]]<br/>+* [[Panjgur District|Panjgur]]<br/>+* [[Pishin District|Pishin]]<br/>+* [[Quetta District|Quetta]]<br/>+* [[Sibi District|Sibi]]<br/>+* Turbat or [[Kech District|Kech]]<br/>+* [[Zhob District|Zhob]]<br/>+* [[Ziarat District|Ziarat]]<br/>+</td></tr><br/>+</table><br/>+</td><td><br/>+[[Image:Balochistan Tehsils.jpg|right|thumb|325px|The districts and tehsils of Balochistan]]<br/>+</td></tr><br/>+</table><br/> <br/>-The two streams of Indian classical music, [[Carnatic music]] and [[Hindustani music]], have independent sets of ragas. There is some overlap, but more "[[false friend|false friendship]]" (where raga names overlap, but raga form does not). In north India, the ragas have recently been categorised into ten <i>thaats</i> or parent scales (by Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande, 1860-1936); [[South India]] uses a somewhat older, more systematic classification scheme called the <i>[[melakarta]]</i> classification, with 72 parent (<i>melakarta</i>) ragas.

It might seem to imply that scales came before ragas, or that ragas are made from scales.  In fact, it's the other way round--parent scales (both melas and thats) were induced from raga practice.

One consultant was quoted as saying "The schools refuse to admit [it] but the fact is, if you know the schools, there's a real formula..." The consultant went on to say that admissions officers at Harvard look for applicants' leadership experience and ability to work through others, Stanford is keen on personal revelations, family dynamics, and identity politics, while Wharton rewards applicants who tell admissions committees in personal terms why Wharton&mdash;and not the other schools&mdash;is the perfect fit for them. <br/>+'''Alan Scott''' is a fictional hero from the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]] and the first superhero to bear the name '''[[Green Lantern]]'''.<br/> <br/>-The Globe characterized admissions officials as "rankled"  by such statements, and director of MBA admissions at Wharton indicate that coaching can work against an applicant: ''Sometimes you read an essay and you lose a sense of who the individual is because the essay is overpolished."

The voice of the flame prophesied that it would act three times: once to bring death, once to bring life, and once to bring power.  By 1940, after having already fulfilled the first two-thirds of this prophesy, the flame had been fashioned into a metal [[lantern]], which fell into the hands of Alan Scott, a young [[engineer]].  Following a railroad bridge collapse, the flame instructed Scott how to fashion a ring from its metal, to give him fantastic powers as the superhero Green Lantern.  He adopted a colorful costume (setting himslef appart from his successors, as he wore very little green in his outfit) and became a crimefighter.<br/> <br/>-== References ==<br/>-*Weisman, Robert (2006) "Wrangling over applications" The Boston Globe, [http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2006/02/06/wrangling_over_applications?mode=PF], Feb. 6, 2006<br/>-*"A Pledge of Integrity", The Boston Globe [http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2006/02/06/a_pledge_of_integrity/], Feb. 6, 2006<br/>+Years later, the green flame would be [[retcon|retconned]] as the expunged [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] characteristics of the [[Guardians of the Universe]] from the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Earth-1|Earth-1]] universe.

He has occasionally used it to create solid objects and force fields in the manner usually associated with fellow Green Lantern [[Hal Jordan]], and to read minds.  His ring could protect him against any object made of metal, but would not protect him against [[wood]], [[rubber]] (in the second story, he is laid low by a rubber sap), or any other plant-based substance.  This was said to be because the green flame was an incarnation of the strength of "green, growing things".<br/>+<br/>+During the 1940s, Green Lantern seemed to alternate between serious adventure - particularly when his arch-nemesis, [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]], appeared - and light comedy, usually involving his sidekick [[Doiby Dickles]].

I am writing to you because you voted "keep" in AfD for aetherometry entry.  The present situation is that by Wikipedia standards there is no reputable secondary literature at all about aetherometry.  The minority view is contained only in primary sources, which do not even fulfill Wikipedia standards for scientific references, and there are no other publications, so there is no majority view.  "Majority view" here does not mean view of majority of Wikipedia administrators, it means published and generally accepted view of outside scientific community.  There is nothing like this for aetherometry.  As result,  nothing in entry can be verified or referenced, it is all interpretation and opinion.  This is not how encyclopedia should work, and is against Wikipedia policy.  Since you said that entry should be kept, you must have idea how entry can start to provide verifiable encyclopedic information when there are no existing secondary sources.  How can this problem be solved?  I think you cannot just say "keep" and leave to others dealing with this problem, which to me seems completely not solvable.  Please, describe what your solution is, and how you will personally help make aetherometry entry honest, reputable and verifiable.  Sincerely, Janusz.

Many of his works are well known in classical music circles, but among the general public, he is probably best known for the various pieces which feature prominently in the [[Stanley Kubrick]] [[film]]s ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', ''[[The Shining]]'', and ''[[Eyes Wide Shut]]''.<br/>+[[Image:Lewis_and_Clark.jpg|thumb|right|Lewis and Clark]]<br/> <br/>-== Biography ==<br/>+The '''Lewis and Clark expedition''' (1804&ndash;1806) was the first [[United States]] overland expedition to the Pacific coast and back, led by '''Captain Meriwether Lewis''' and '''Second Lieutenant William Clark''', of the US Army.<br/> <br/>-Ligeti was born in Dicsöszentmárton (now [[Târnăveni]]), in the [[Transylvania]] region of [[Romania]]. Dicsöszentmárton was then a mainly Hungarian town with a large Jewish population. Ligeti recalls that his first exposure to the Romanian language came one day while listening to a conversation among the Romanian-speaking town police, a baffling experience for the young boy. After he left, he was not to return to the town of his birth until the 1990s. <br/>+==Louisiana Purchase and a western expedition==<br/>+[[Image:lewisclarkrussell.jpg|thumb|300px|right|''Lewis and Clark on the Lower Columbia'' by C.M.

It changed mapping of northwest America by providing the first accurate depiction of the relationship of the sources of the [[Columbia River|Columbia]] and [[Missouri River|Missouri]] rivers, and the Rocky Mountains.]]<br/> <br/>-Ligeti received his initial musical training in the conservatory at Cluj-Napoca/Kolozsvár, a large city in the center of Transylvania. His education was interrupted in 1943 when, as a Jew, he was forced to labor by the Nazis. At the same time his parents, brother, and other relatives were deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp, his mother being the only survivor.<br/>+The [[Louisiana Purchase]], in 1803, sparked interest in expansion to the west coast. A few weeks after the purchase, [[United States President]] [[Thomas Jefferson]], an advocate of western expansion, had the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] appropriate $2500, "to send intelligent officers with ten or twelve men, and to explore even to the western ocean". They were to study the [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian tribes]], [[botany]], [[geology]], Western Terrain and [[wildlife]] in the region, as well as evaluate the potential interference of British and French-Canadian hunters and trappers who were already well established in the area. The expedition was not the first to cross North America, but was roughly a decade after the expedition of [[Alexander MacKenzie]], the first European to cross to the [[Pacific Ocean]], in 1793.<br/> <br/>-Following the war, Ligeti returned to his studies in [[Budapest]], graduating in 1949. He studied under [[Pál Kadosa]], [[Ferenc Farkas]], [[Zoltan Kodaly|Zoltán Kodály]] and [[Sandor Veress|Sándor Veress]]. He went on to do [[ethnomusicology|ethnomusicological]] work on [[Romania]]n [[folk music]], but after a year returned to his old school in Budapest, this time as a teacher of [[harmony]], [[counterpoint]] and [[musical analysis]]. However, communications between Hungary and the west had been cut off by the then [[communism|communist]] government, and Ligeti had to secretly listen to [[radio]] broadcasts to keep abreast of musical developments. In December of [[1956]], two months after the Hungarian uprising was put down by the Soviet Army, he fled to [[Vienna]] and eventually took Austrian citizenship.<br/>+Jefferson selected [[Meriwether Lewis|Captain Meriwether Lewis]] to lead the expedition, afterwards known as the '''Corps of Discovery'''; Lewis selected [[William Clark]] as his partner. Due to bureaucratic delays in the [[United States Army|US Army]], Clark officially only held the rank of [[Second Lieutenant]] at the time, but Lewis concealed this from the men and shared the leadership of the expedition, always referring to Clark as "Captain" ([http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/v02.appendix.a.html]).<br/> <br/>-There, he was able to meet several key [[avant-garde]] figures from whom he had been cut off from in Hungary. These included the composers [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] and [[Gottfried Michael Koenig]], both then working on groundbreaking [[electronic music]]. Ligeti worked in the same [[Cologne]] studio as them, and he was inspired by the sounds he was able to create there. However, he produced little electronic music of his own, instead concentrating on instrumental works which often contain electronic-sounding textures.<br/>+The group, initially consisting of 33 members, departed from [[Camp Dubois]], near present day Hartford, Illinois, and began their historic journey on [[May 14]], 1804. They soon met-up with Lewis in [[Saint Charles, Missouri]] and the approximately forty men followed the [[Missouri River]] westward. Soon they passed [[La Charrette]] Missouri, the last white settlement on the Missouri River. The expedition followed the Missouri through what is now [[Kansas City, Missouri]] and [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. On [[August 20]], 1804, the Corps of Discovery suffered its first and only death when Sergeant [[Charles Floyd (explorer)|Charles Floyd]] died, apparently from acute [[appendicitis]].  He was buried at [[Floyd's Bluff]], near what is now [[Sioux City]], [[Iowa]]. During the final week of August, Lewis and Clark had reached the edge of the Great Plains, a place abounding with elk, deer, buffalo, and beavers. They were also entering Sioux territory.<br/> <br/>-From this time, Ligeti's work became better known and respected, and his best known work might be said to span the period from ''Apparitions'' (1958-9) to ''Lontano'' (1967), although his later [[opera]], ''[[Le Grand Macabre]]'' (1978) is also fairly well known. In more recent years, his three books of [[piano]] ''[[Étude]]s'' have become quite well known thanks to recordings made by [[Pierre-Laurent Aimard]], [[Fredrik Ullén]], and others.<br/>+The first tribe of Sioux they met, the Yankton Sioux, were more peaceful than their neighbors further along the Missouri River, the Teton Sioux. The Yankton Sioux were disappointed by the gifts they received from Lewis and Clark--five medals--and gave the explorers a warning about the upriver Teton Sioux. The Teton Sioux received their gifts with ill-disguised hostility. One chief demanded a boat from Lewis and Clark as the price to be paid for passage through their territory. As the Indians became more dangerous, Lewis and Clark prepared to fight back. At the last moment before fighting began, the two sides fell back. The Americans quickly headed upriver until winter stopped them at the Mandan tribe's territory.<br/> <br/>-Ligeti took a teaching post in [[Hamburg]] in 1973, resigning in 1989. Since the [[1980s]], he has suffered from ill health, which has slowed his compositional output, though he continues to write.<br/>+In the winter of 1804&ndash;1805, the party wintered at [[Fort Mandan]], near present-day [[Washburn, North Dakota]]. The [[Shoshone]]/[[Hidatsa]] [[Native Americans in the United States|native]] woman [[Sacagawea]] and her husband, [[French Canadian]] [[Toussaint Charbonneau]], joined the group there and guided them westward. Sacagawea and her [[Shoshone]] tribe came from further west. Not only did Lewis and Clark feel that she could aid them in translation, but they also thought that when they got to that part of the country, she could take them to her native home.  In April 1805, some members of the expedition were sent back home from Mandan in the 'return party'. Along with them went a report about what Lewis and Clark had discovered, 108 botanical specimens, 68 mineral specimens, and Clark's map of the United States.<br/> <br/>-Aside from his musical interests, Ligeti has expressed fondness for the [[fractal geometry]] of [[Benoît Mandelbrot]], and the writings of [[Lewis Caroll]] and [[Douglas R. Hofstadter]].<br/>+The expedition continued to follow the Missouri to its headwaters and the [[Continental Divide]]. In canoes, they  descended the mountains by the [[Clearwater River]], the [[Snake River]], and the [[Columbia River]], past [[Celilo Falls]] and through what is now [[Portland, Oregon]] until they reached the [[Pacific Ocean]] in the December of 1805. At this point, Lewis spotted [[Mt. Hood]], a mountain known to be very close to the ocean. On a big [[pine]], Clark carved<br/>+:''"William Clark December 3rd 1805. By land from the U.States in 1804 & 1805"'' {{fn|1.deVoto}}  <br/> <br/>-Ligeti's son, [[Lukas Ligeti]], is a composer and percussionist based in New York City.<br/>+Clark had written in his journal, "Ocian [sic] in view! O! The Joy!". One journal entry is captioned "Cape Disappointment at the Enterance of the Columbia River into the the Great ''South Sea'' or Pacific Ocean".{{fn|1.deVoto}} By that time the expedition faced its second bitter winter during the trip, so the group decided to vote on whether to camp on the north or south side of the Columbia River. Interestingly, York (Clark's [[manservant]]), a slave, and Sacagawea, an Indian and a woman, voted along with the men of the party. The party agreed to camp on the south side of the river (modern [[Astoria, Oregon]]), building [[Fort Clatsop]] as their winter quarters. While wintering at the fort, the men prepared for the trip home by boiling salt from the ocean, hunting elk and other wildlife. Mostly they just endured the persistent rain. <br/> <br/>-== Ligeti's music ==<br/>+The explorers started their journey home on [[March 23]], [[1806]] and arrived on [[September 23]]. On the way home, Lewis and Clark used four dugout canoes they bought from the Native Americans, plus one that they stole [http://www.lewis-clark.org/content/content-article.asp?ArticleID=513]. Less than a month after leaving Fort Clatsop, they abandoned their canoes because crossing across all the falls proved too much a challenge.<br/> <br/>-Ligeti's earliest works are an extension of the musical language of his countryman [[Béla Bartók]]. The [[piano]] pieces, ''Musica Ricercata'' (1951-53), for example, are often compared to Bartók's set of piano works, ''[[Mikrokosmos]]''. Ligeti's set comprises eleven pieces in all. The first uses almost exclusively just one pitch class, A, heard in multiple [[octave]]s. Only at the very end of the piece is a second note, D, heard. The second piece then adds a third note to these two, the third piece adds a fourth note, and so on, so that in the eleventh piece, all twelve notes of the [[chromatic scale]] are present.<br/>+On July 3, Lewis and Clark split into two teams so Lewis could explore the Marias River. Lewis' group of four met the Blackfeet Indians. Their interview was cordial, but during the night, th Blackfeet tried to steal their weapons. In the struggle, two Indians were killed. The group of four--Lewis, Drouillard, and the Field brothers fled over 100 miles in a day before they camped again. Clark, meanwhile, had entered Crow territory. The [[Crow tribe]] were known as horse thieves. At night, half of Clark's horses were gone, but not a single Crow was seen. Lewis and Clark stayed separated until they reached the confluence of the Yellowstone and Missouri Rivers on August 11, when one of Clark's hunters, Pierre Cruzatte, blind in one eye and nearsighted in the other, mistook Lewis for an elk and fired, injuring Lewis in the thigh. From there, the groups were reunited and able to quickly return home by the Missouri River.<br/> <br/>-Already at this early stage in his career, Ligeti was affected by the [[communism|communist]] regime in Hungary at that time. The tenth piece of ''Musica Ricercata'' was banned by the authorities on account of it being "decadent". It seems that it was thus branded owing to its liberal use of minor second [[interval (music)|interval]]s. Given the far more radical direction that Ligeti was looking to take his music in, it is hardly surprising that he felt the need to leave Hungary.<br/>+The Corps of Discovery returned with important information about the new United States territory and the people who lived in it, as well as its rivers and mountains, plants and animals. The expedition made a major contribution to mapping the North American continent.<br/> <br/>-Upon arriving in [[Cologne]], he began to write electronic music alongside [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]. He produced only three works in this medium, however, including ''Glissandi'' (1957) and ''Artikulation'' (1958), before returning to instrumental work. His music appears to have been subsequently influenced by his electronic experiments, and many of the sounds he created resembled electronic textures. ''Apparitions'' (1958-59) was the first work which brought him to critical attention, but it is his next work, ''Atmosphères'', which is better known today. It was used, along with excerpts from ''Lux Aeterna'' and ''Requiem'', in the soundtrack to [[Stanley Kubrick|Kubrick's]] ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]''; in fact, the music was used without Ligeti's permission.<br/>+:''See [[Timeline of the Lewis and Clark Expedition]] for more detail''<br/> <br/>-''Atmosphères'' (1961) is written for large [[orchestra]]. It is seen as a key piece in Ligeti's output, laying out many of the concerns he would explore through the [[1960]]s. It virtually completely abandons [[melody]], [[harmony]] and [[rhythm]], instead concentrating purely on the [[timbre]] of the sound produced, a technique known as [[sound mass]]. It opens with what must be one of the largest [[cluster chord]]s ever written - every note in the [[chromatic scale]] over a range of five octaves is played at once. The piece seems to grow out of this initial massive, but very quiet, [[chord (music)|chord]], with the textures always changing.  <br/>+[http://www.sierraclub.org/lewisandclark/journal/ Also for a better journal kept by the Corps of Discovery]<br/>+==Achievements==<br/>+[[Image:Prairie.dog.600pix.jpg|thumb|170px|Black tailed Prairie Dog]]<br/> <br/>-Ligeti coined the term "[[micropolyphony]]" for the compositional technique used in ''Atmosphères'', ''Apparitions'' and his other works of the time. He explained micropolyphony as follows: "The complex polyphony of the individual parts is embodied in a harmonic-musical flow, in which the harmonies do not change suddenly, but merge into one another; one clearly discernible interval combination is gradually blurred, and from this cloudiness it is possible to discern a new interval combination taking shape."<br/>+*The U.S. gained an extensive knowledge of the [[geography]] of the [[American West]] in the form of maps of major rivers and mountain ranges<br/>+*Discovered and described 178 new plants and 122 species and subspecies of animals (see [[List of species described by the Lewis and Clark Expedition]])<br/> <br/>-From the [[1970s]], Ligeti returned to some extent to a more melodic style, and also began to concentrate on rhythm. Pieces such as ''[[Continuum (Ligeti)|Continuum]]'' (1970), ''Clocks and Clouds'' (1972-3), were written before he heard the music of [[Steve Reich]] and [[Terry Riley]] in 1972, yet the second of his ''Three Pieces for Two Pianos'', "Self-portrait with Reich and Riley (and Chopin in the background)," commemorates this affirmation and influence. He also became interested in the rhythmic aspects of [[African music]], specifically that of the [[Pygmies]]. In the mid-'70s he wrote his first opera, ''Le Grande Macabre'', a work of absurd theatre with many [[eschatology|eschatological]] references.  His music of the 1980s and '90s has continued to emphasize complex mechanical rhythms, often in a less densely chromatic idiom (he tends to favor displaced [[major]] and [[minor triad]]s and poly[[musical mode|modal]] structures).  Particularly significant are the ''[[Études pour piano]]'' (Book I, 1985; Book II, 1988-94; Book III 1995-2001), which draw from such diverse sources as [[gamelan]], African [[polyrhythm]]s, Bartók, [[Conlon Nancarrow]], and [[Bill Evans]].  Other notable works in this vein include the ''Horn Trio'' (1982), the ''Piano Concerto'' (1985-88), the ''Violin Concerto'' (1992), and the a cappella ''Nonsense Madrigals'' (1993).<br/>+*Opened American fur trade in the West<br/>+*Paved the way for peaceful relations with the Indians<br/>+*Established a precedent for Army exploration of the West<br/>+*Strengthened the U.S. claim to [[Oregon Territory]]<br/>+*Focused U.S. and media attention on the West<br/>+*Produced the first literature about the West (the Lewis and Clark diaries)<br/>+*Made themselves heroes throughout the country and big names in Early American History<br/>+*Helped show pioneers some of the Oregon Trail<br/> <br/>-Ligeti's most recent work is the ''Hamburg Concerto'' for horn and chamber orchestra (1998-99, revised 2003).<br/>+==Expedition members==<br/>+*Captain '''[[Meriwether Lewis]]''' (1774 &ndash; 1809) was private secretary to President Thomas Jefferson and leader of the Expedition.<br/>+*Captain '''[[William Clark]]''' (1770 &ndash; 1838) shared command of the Expedition, although technically second in command.

Ambrose]], author of the book ''Undaunted Courage'' about the expedition, compared the significance and impact of the Lewis and Clark Expedition to Americans of that era with the American landing on the moon for subsequent generations. The expedition not only answered questions about vast uncharted areas of North America (everything between the Missouri River in North Dakota to Mount Hood in western Oregon) but also gave Americans an electrifying sense of the vastness of their new country after the Louisiana Purchase and America's almost limitless natural resources and potential as an emergent nation. He also views the expedition as a quintessential American saga, with a cast of characters that included a French Canadian trapper, President Thomas Jefferson, the heroic personalities and camaraderie of both Captain Lewis and Captain Clark, a platoon of American soldiers reminiscent of [[Rogers' Rangers]], the muscular Black American servant of Clark named York, colorful Indian tribes ([[Sioux]], [[Mandan]]s, [[Nez Percé]], [[Blackfeet]]), Captain Lewis' shaggy dog named Seaman, numerous close shaves with death for everyone on the expedition, quick "think-on-your-feet" diplomatic innovation to defuse hostility and enlist the support of exotic tribes, scientific observation of awe-inspiring naturalistic phenomenon, a case of close combat with Indians, encounters with grizzly bears, harrowing navigation of wild rivers amidst magnificent scenery, and a difficult passage through the snow clad [[Bitterroot Mountains]] of Western [[Montana]] and [[Idaho]]. Despite all the trials, tribulations, and close calls, the expedition did not lose a person between [[North Dakota]] and [[Oregon]] and lost no one on the return trip.

More about Bahadur and the Mutiny in particular - his attitude towards it, level of involvement, etc. (For example, afterwards the British accused him of having helped plan it and produced evidence that he had been in communication with the Afghans urging them to invade India and throw the British out - yet when the mutineers first appeared at the walls of the Red Fort his immediate reaction was to order the gates shut and ask the British to shoot them!). More also on Bahadur's discovery by Indian nationalists, who made him a hero where the British made him a villain - both attempts at manipulating the poor man, though for quite different purposes. A little more on his time in Rangoon and the attitude towards him as a saint, expressed by the current status of his tomb as a place of pilgimage. And I'd like a really expert assessment of Bahadur as a poet - is he really that good?  Incidentally, some statements in this article I question - I don't think his sons and grandson were executed in front of him - they were captured separately and shot because the British officers were afraid the crowd was going to riot.

During his lifetime he earned a reputation as a leading [[humanism|humanist]] scholar and occupied many public offices, including that of [[Lord Chancellor]] from [[1529]] to [[1532]].  More coined the word "[[utopia]]", a name he gave to an ideal, imaginary island nation whose political system he described in a book published in [[1516]].  He is chiefly remembered for his principled refusal to accept King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s claim to be the supreme head of the [[Church of England]], a decision which ended his political career and led to his [[capital punishment|execution]] as a [[treason|traitor]].  In [[1935]], four hundred years after his death, More was [[canonization|canonized]] in the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and was later declared the [[patron saint]] of statesmen, lawyers, and politicians.<br/>-<br/>-==Early life==<br/>-Born in Milk Street, [[London]], Thomas More was the eldest son of Sir John More, a successful lawyer who served as a judge in the [[King's Bench]] court.  More was educated at St Anthony's School and was later a page in the service of [[John Morton]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], who declared that young Thomas would become a "marvellous man".  Thomas attended the [[University of Oxford]] for two years, where he studied [[Latin]] and [[logic]].  He then returned to London, where he studied law with his father and was admitted to [[Lincoln's Inn]] in [[1496]].  In [[1501]] More became a [[barrister]].<br/>-<br/>-To his father's great displeasure, More seriously contemplated abandoning his legal career in order to become a [[monk]]. For about four years he lodged at the [[London Charterhouse]] next to Lincoln's Inn and also considered joining the [[Franciscan]] order. Perhaps because he judged himself incapable of [[celibacy]], More finally decided to marry in [[1505]], but for the rest of his life he continued to observe many ascetical practices, including self-punishment in the form of wearing a [[hair shirt]] and occasional [[flagellation]].<br/>-<br/>-More had four children by his first wife, Jane Colt, who died in [[1511]].  He remarried almost immediately, to a rich widow named Alice Middleton who was several years his senior. More and Alice Middleton did not have children together, though More raised Alice's daughter from her previous husband as his own.  More provided his daughters with an excellent classical education at a time when such learning was usually reserved for men.<br/>-<br/>-==Early political career==<br/>-From [[1510]] to [[1518]], More served as one of the two undersheriffs of the city of London, a position of considerable responsibility in which he earned a reputation as an honest and effective public servant.  In [[1517]] More entered the king's service as councilor and "master of requests".  After undertaking a diplomatic mission to [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], More was knighted and made undertreasurer in [[1521]]. As secretary and personal advisor to King Henry [[VIII]], More became increasingly influential in the government, welcoming foreign diplomats, drafting official documents, and serving as a liaison between the king and his Lord Chancellor: [[Thomas Cardinal Wolsey]], [[Archbishop of York]].<br/>-<br/>-In [[1523]] More became the [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker of the House of Commons]].  He later served as high steward for the universities of Oxford and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].  In [[1525]] he became [[chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]], a position that entailed administrative and judicial control of much of northern England.<br/>-<br/>-==Scholarly and literary work==<br/>-[[Image:Utopia.jpg|300px|thumb|left|[[Woodcut]] by [[Ambrosius Holbein]] for a [[1518]] edition of ''Utopia.''  The traveler Raphael Hythloday is depicted in the lower left-hand corner describing to a listener the island of Utopia, whose layout is schematically shown above him.]]<br/>- <br/>-More combined his busy political career with a rich scholarly and literary production.  His writing and scholarship earned him a considerable reputation as a Christian humanist in continental Europe, and his friend [[Erasmus of Rotterdam]] dedicated his masterpiece, ''[[In Praise of Folly]]'', to him.  (Indeed, the title of Erasmus's book is partly a play on More's name, the word ''folly'' being ''moria'' in Greek.)  Erasmus also described More as a model man of letters in his communications with other European humanists.  The humanistic project embraced by Erasmus and Thomas More sought to reexamine and revitalize Christian [[theology]] by studying the [[Bible]] and the writings of the [[Church Fathers]] in the light of classical [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] tradition in literature and philosophy.  More and Erasmus collaborated on a Latin translation of the works of [[Lucian]], which was published in [[Paris]] in [[1506]].<br/>-<br/>-===''History of King Richard III''===<br/>-<br/>-Between [[1513]] and [[1518]], More worked on a ''History of King [[Richard III of England|Richard III]]'', an unfinished piece of [[historiography]] which heavily influenced [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]''.  Both More's and Shakespeare's works are controversial among modern historians for their exceedingly unflattering portrayal of King Richard, a bias due at least in part to the authors' allegiance to the reigning [[Tudor dynasty]], which had wrested the throne from Richard at the end of the [[Wars of the Roses]]. More's work, however, barely mentions [[Henry VII of England|King Henry VII]], the first Tudor king, perhaps because More blamed Henry for having persecuted his father, John More.<br/>-<br/>-===''Utopia''===<br/>-<br/>-In [[1515]] More wrote his most famous and controversial work, ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'', a book in which a fictional traveller, Raphael Hythloday ( Nonsenso, literally dispenser of nonsense ), describes the political arrangements of the imaginary island nation of Utopia (a play on the Greek ''ou-topos'', meaning "no place", and ''eu-topos'', meaning "good place").  In the book, More contrasts the contentious social life of [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Europe]]an states with the perfectly orderly and reasonable social arrangements of the non-Christian Utopia, where [[property|private property]] does not exist and almost complete [[religious toleration]] is practiced.  Many commentators have pointed out that [[Karl Marx]]'s later vision of the ideal [[Communism|communist]] state strongly resembles More's Utopia.<br/>-<br/>-More might have chosen the literary device of describing an imaginary nation primarily as a vehicle for discussing controversial political matters freely.  His own attitude towards the arrangements he describes in the book is the subject of much debate.  While it seems unlikely that More, a devout Roman Catholic, intended pagan, proto-communist Utopia as a concrete model for political reform, some have speculated that More based his Utopia on [[monk|monastic]] communalism or on the [[Bible|Biblical]] communalism described in the ''[[Acts of the Apostles]]''.<br/>-<br/>-The original edition included details of a symmetrical alphabet of More's own invention, called the "[[Utopian alphabet]]". This alphabet was omitted from later editions, though it remains notable as an early attempt at cryptography that may have influenced the development of shorthand.<br/>-<br/>-===Religious polemics===<br/>-<br/>-As Henry VIII's advisor and secretary, More helped to write the ''[[Defense of the Seven Sacraments]]'', a polemic against Protestant doctrine that earned Henry the title of "Defender of the Faith" from the Pope in 1521. Both Martin Luther's response to Henry and More's subsequent ''Reply to Luther'' have been criticized for their slanderous ''[[ad hominem]]'' attacks.<br/>-<br/>-==Henry VIII's divorce==<br/>-On the death in [[1502]] of Henry's elder brother, [[Arthur, Prince of Wales]], Henry became [[heir apparent]] to the English throne and married his brother's widow, [[Catherine of Aragon]], daughter of the Spanish king, as a means of preserving the English alliance with [[Spain]]. Henry also found himself in love with Catherine. At the time, [[Pope Julius II]] had issued a formal dispensation from the biblical injunction against a man marrying his brother's widow.  This dispensation was based partly on Catherine's testimony that the marriage between her and Arthur had not been [[consummate|consummated]].<br/>-<br/>-For nearly 20 years the marriage of Henry VIII and Catherine was smooth, but Catherine failed to provide a male heir and Henry eventually became enamored of [[Anne Boleyn]], one of Queen Catherine's ladies in the court. In [[1527]], Henry instructed Cardinal Wolsey to petition [[Pope Clement VII]] for an [[annulment]] of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, on the grounds that the pope had no authority to override a biblical injunction, and that therefore Julius's dispensation had been invalid, rendering his marriage to Catherine void.  After the pope steadfastly refused such an annulment, Henry forced Wolsey to resign as Lord Chancellor and appointed Thomas More in his place in [[1529]]. Henry then began to embrace the Protestant teaching that the Pope was only the [[Bishop of Rome]] and therefore had no authority over the Christian Church as a whole.<br/>-<br/>-==Chancellorship==<br/>-More, until then fully devoted to Henry and to the cause of royal prerogative, initially cooperated with the king's new policy, denouncing Wolsey in Parliament and proclaiming the opinion of the theologians at Oxford and Cambridge that the marriage of Henry to Catherine had been unlawful.  But as Henry began to deny the authority of the Pope, More's qualms grew.<br/>-<br/>-===Campaign against Protestantism===<br/>-More, despite the tolerant attitude suggested by his earlier works, had come to believe that the rise of Protestantism represented a grave threat to social and political order in Christian Europe.  During his tenure as Lord Chancellor, he wrote several books in which he attacked Protestantism and defended the existing anti-[[heresy]] laws, which he vigorously enforced. More had six Protestants [[Execution by burning|burned at the stake]] and ordered the imprisonment of as many as forty others.  His chief concern in this matter was to root out collaborators of [[William Tyndale]], the exiled Lutheran who in [[1525]] had published an English translation of the Bible which was circulating clandestinely in England.<br/>-<br/>-===Resignation===<br/>-In [[1530]] More refused to sign a letter by the leading English churchmen and aristocrats asking the Pope to annul Henry's marriage to Catherine. In [[1531]] he attempted to resign after being forced to take an oath declaring the king the supreme head of the English church "as far the law of Christ allows".  In [[1532]] he asked the king again to relieve him of his office, claiming that he was ill and suffering from sharp chest pains.  This time Henry granted his request.<br/>-<br/>-==Trial and execution==<br/>-The last straw for Henry came in [[1533]], when More refused to attend the coronation of [[Anne Boleyn]] as the [[Queen of England]].  Shortly thereafter More was charged with accepting [[bribe]]s, but the patently false charges had to be dismissed for lack of any evidence.  In [[1534]] he was accused of conspiring with [[Elizabeth Barton]], a [[nun]] who had prophesized against the king's divorce, but More was able to produce a letter in which he had instructed Barton not to interfere with state matters.<br/>-<br/>-On [[April 13]] of that year More was asked to appear before a commission and swear his allegiance to the parliamentary [[English Act of Succession|Act of Succession]].  More accepted Parliament's right to declare Anne the legitimate queen of England, but he refused to take the oath because an anti-papal preface to the Act made of it an acknowledgement of Parliament's authority to legislate in matters of religion by denying the authority of the Pope, which More would not accept. Four days later he was imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]], where he wrote his devotional ''Dialogue of Comfort Against Tribulation''.<br/>-<br/>-On [[July 1]] [[1535]], More was tried before a panel of judges that included the new Lord Chancellor, Sir [[Thomas Audley, 1st Baron Audley of Walden|Thomas Audley]], as well as Anne Boleyn's father, brother, and uncle.  He was charged with high treason for denying the validity of the Act of Succession.  More believed he could not be convicted as long as he did not explicitly deny that the king was the head of the church, and he therefore refused to answer all questions regarding his opinions on the subject.  [[Thomas Cromwell]], at the time the most powerful of the king's advisors, brought forth the [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor General]], [[Richard Rich]], to testify that More had, in his presence, denied that the king was the legitimate head of the church.  This testimony was almost certainly perjured (witnesses [[Richard Southwell]] and Mr Palmer both denied having heard the details of the reported conversation), but on the strength of it the jury voted for More's conviction.<br/>-<br/>-Before his sentencing, More spoke freely of his belief that "no temporal man may be head of the spirituality". He was sentenced to be [[hanged, drawn and quartered|hanged, drawn, and quartered]] (the usual punishment for traitors) but the king commuted this to execution by [[beheading]]. On the scaffold he declared that he died "the king's good servant and God's first." The execution took place on [[July 6]]. More's body was buried at the Tower of London, in the chapel of St. Peter ad Vincula.  His head was placed over [[London Bridge]] for a month and was rescued by his daughter, [[Margaret Roper]], before it could be thrown in the [[River Thames]].  The skull is believed to rest in the Roper Vault of St. Dunstan's Church, in [[Canterbury]].<br/>-<br/>-==Influence and reputation==<br/>-[[Image:HouseOfMore.JPG|300px|right|thumb|House of Thomas More in London.]]<br/>-[[Image:Chelsea_thomas_more_statue_1.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Statue of Thomas More in front of Chelsea Old Church, [[Cheyne Walk]], [[London]]. (January 2006)]]<br/>-<br/>-The steadfastness with which More held on to his religious convictions in the face of ruin and death, and the dignity with which he conducted himself during his imprisonment, trial, and execution, contributed much to More's posthumous reputation, particularly among Roman Catholics.  More was [[beatification|beatified]] by the Pope in [[1886]] and canonized with [[John Fisher]] after a mass petition of English Roman Catholics in [[1935]]. His joint feast day with Fisher is [[22 June]]. In [[2000]], Saint Thomas More was declared "heavenly patron of statesmen and politicians" by [[Pope John Paul II]].<br/>-<br/>-More's conviction for treason was widely seen as unfair, even among Protestants.  His friend [[Erasmus]], who was broadly sympathetic to reform movements within the Christian Church, declared after his execution that More had been "more pure than any snow" and that his genius was "such as England never had and never again will have."  More was portrayed as a wise and honest statesman in the [[1592]] play ''Sir Thomas More'', which was probably written in collaboration by [[Henry Chettle]], [[Anthony Munday]], [[William Shakespeare]], and others, and which survives only in fragmentary form after being censored by Edmund Tylney, [[Master of the Revels]] in the government of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]].<br/>-<br/>-Roman Catholic writer [[G.K. Chesterton]] said that More was the "greatest historical character in English history."  The [[20th-century]] [[agnosticism|agnostic]] playwright [[Robert Bolt]] portrayed More as the ultimate man of conscience in his play ''[[A Man for All Seasons]]. ''That title is borrowed from Robert Whittinton, who wrote in 1520 that More:<br/>-<br/>-:"is a man of an angel's wit and singular learning. I know not his fellow. For where is the man of that gentleness, lowliness and affability? And, as time requireth, a man of marvelous mirth and pastimes, and sometime of as sad gravity. A man for all seasons." [http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/politics/pg0078.html]<br/>-<br/>-In [[1966]], Bolt's play was made into a successful film directed by [[Fred Zinnemann]].  <br/>-<br/>-[[Karl Zuchardt]] wrote a novel, ''Stirb Du Narr!'' ("Die you fool!"), about More's struggle with King Henry, portraying More as an idealist bound to fail in the power struggle with a ruthless ruler and an unjust world.<br/>-<br/>-As the author of ''Utopia'', More has also attracted the admiration of modern [[Socialism|socialist]]s.  While Roman Catholic scholars maintain that More's attitude in composing ''Utopia'' was largely [[irony|ironic]] and that he was at every point an orthodox Christian, Marxist theoretician [[Karl Kautsky]] argued in the book ''Thomas More and his Utopia'' ([[1888]]) that ''Utopia'' was a shrewd critique of economic and social exploitation in pre-modern [[Europe]] and that More was one of the key intellectual figures in the early development of socialist ideas.<br/>-<br/>-A number of modern writers, such as [[Richard Marius]], have attacked More for alleged  religious fanaticism and intolerance (manifested, for instance, in his enthusiastic persecution of heretics). The polemicist [[Jasper Ridley]] goes much further, describing More as "a particularly nasty sadomasochistic pervert" in his book ''The Statesman and the Fanatic'', a line also followed by Joanna Dennyn in a biography of Anne Boleyn.<br/>-<br/>-Other biographers, such as [[Peter Ackroyd]], have offered a more sympathetic picture of More as both a sophisticated humanist and man of letters, as well as a zealous Roman Catholic who believed in the necessity of religious and political authority.<br/>-<br/>-==Biographies==<br/>-*[[William Roper]], [http://www.bartleby.com/36/2/ "The Life of Sir Thomas More"] (written by More's son-in-law ''ca''.

({{nasdaq|AMZN}}) is an [[United States|American]] [[electronic commerce]] company based in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], [[Washington]]. It was one of the first major companies to sell goods over the [[Internet]]. Amazon also owns [[Alexa Internet]], [[a9.com]], and the [[Internet Movie Database]] (IMDb).<br/> <br/>-Founded as Cadabra.com by [[Jeff Bezos]] in [[1994]] and launched in [[1995]], Amazon.com began as an [[online]] [[bookstore]], though it soon diversified its product lines, adding [[DVD]]s, music [[CD]]s, [[computer]] [[software]], [[video game]]s, [[electronics]], [[apparel]], [[furniture]], [[food]], and more.<br/>+'''Be My Last''' is [[Utada Hikaru]]'s eighteenth single. It was released on [[September 28]], [[2005]] and was also her first Japanese single in [[2005]]. This song is the main theme for the up and coming movie "Haru no Yuki", or its English title, "Snowy Love Fallin' in Spring".<br/> <br/>-Amazon offers [[Amazon Web Services|web services]] for access to its catalog as well as for integration with retailers like [[Target Corporation|Target]] and [[Marks & Spencer]]. [[a9.com]] provides search engine services directly on the Amazon.com site.<br/>+'''Be My Last''' reached # 1 on the first day of its release on the [[Oricon]] chart. "Be My Last" has sold about 145,000 copies. [[Utada Hikaru]] had five TV performances a month after it had been released due to her promotionial work in Europe which delayed her performances. On the television program [[Music Station]], [[Utada Hikaru]] was accompanied with a cello as background music for "Be My Last" instead of the CD version which she had used for the other programs. [[Matsuura Aya]] had also sung '''Be My Last''' on [[October 30]], [[2005]].<br/> <br/>-==Business model==<br/>-[[Image:Amazon website-disaster victims.png|thumb|right|320px|Screenshot of the Amazon home page using [[Internet Explorer]]]]<br/>-The company began as an online [[bookstore]].  Founder Bezos saw the potential of the Internet; while the largest brick-and-mortar bookstore might offer upwards of 200,000 titles, an online bookstore could sell many times more.  Bezos renamed his company "Amazon" in reference to the world's most voluminous river, the [[Amazon River|Amazon]].  Amazon.com began service in July 1995. The company was originally incorporated in [[1994]] in the state of [[Washington]] and was reincorporated in [[1996]] in [[Delaware]].  Amazon.com had its [[initial public offering]] on [[May 15]], [[1997]], trading on the [[NASDAQ]] stock exchange under the symbol '''AMZN''' at an IPO price of $18.00 per share (equivalent to $1.50 after three [[stock split]]s during the late [[1990s]]).<br/>+==Track Listing==<br/>+*CD Version<br/>+#Be My Last<br/> <br/>-Amazon's initial [[business plan]] was unusual, in that the company did not expect to turn a profit for four to five years after it was founded.  In retrospect the strategy was sound, despite the [[dotcom death|dotcom collapse of 2000]].  Amazon grew at a steady pace in the late [[1990s]] while other Internet companies appeared out of nowhere and grew at a blindingly fast pace.  Amazon's "slow" growth caused a number of its stockholders to complain, saying that the company was not reaching profitability fast enough.  When the Internet "bubble" burst and many e-companies began going out of business, Amazon persevered and finally turned its first-ever profit in the fourth quarter of 2002.  It totaled a meager $5 million, just 1 cent per share, on revenues of over $1 billion, but it was important symbolically.  It has since remained profitable and maintained revenues of over $1 billion per fiscal quarter. In January 2004 Amazon posted its first full-year net profit (for calendar year 2003). Its profits were $35.3 million on revenues of $5.65 billion. Much of the growth of the company was due to its international division.<br/>+*CD+DVD Version<br/>+CD Tracklist<br/>+#Be My Last<br/>+DVD Tracklist<br/>+#Be My Last (Music Video)<br/> <br/>-Recognizing the website's success in popularizing online shopping, ''[[Time Magazine]]'' named Bezos its [[1999]] [[Man of the Year]].<br/>+== Charts ==<br/> <br/>-==Partnerships and locations==<br/>-Amazon.com operates retail websites not only for the United States, but also for [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[France]], [[China]] and [[Japan]].

Typing [[Toys R Us|ToysRUs]].com into one's browser will similarly bring up Amazon.com's Toys & Games tab. Amazon.com also operates retail Web sites for [[Target Corporation|Target]], the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]], and [http://www.bombaycompany.com/ Bombay Company].<br/>-<br/>-===Corporate headquarters===<br/>-The company's headquarters are in [[Seattle, Washington]] (more specifically, [[Beacon Hill, Seattle, Washington|Beacon Hill]]).

Amazon also has customer service centers in [[Japan]] and, through [[Joyo.com]], in [[China]].<br/>-<br/>-==Expansion of product lines and site features==<br/>-Amazon's bookstore quickly began expanding, branching off into retail sales of [[music]] [[compact disc|CD]]s, videos and [[DVD]]s, [[software]], consumer [[electronics]], kitchen items, tools, lawn and [[garden]] items, [[toy]]s, [[apparel]], sporting goods, gourmet [[food]], [[jewelry]], [[watch]]es, [[health]] and personal-care items, [[cosmetics|beauty products]], [[musical instrument]]s, and more.<br/>-<br/>-A popular feature of Amazon is the ability for users to submit reviews to the web-page of each product.  As part of their review users must rate the product on a scale from one to five stars.  Since Amazon does not allow for a no star rating the star system can be interpreted as being on a zero to four rating. <br/>-<br/>-Announced at the very end of 2005 is a new feature called Amazon Connect, which is likely to prove quite popular with authors since it allows them to post remarks that appear at the bottom of the detail pages for each of their books and on the Amazon home page of those who have bought their books. Only authors whose books are sold by Amazon can participate.<br/>-<br/>-According to information in the Amazon.com discussion forums, Amazon derives about 40% of its sales from affiliates, whom they call "Associates."  An Associate is essentially an independent seller or business that receives a commission for referring customers to the Amazon.com site.  Associates do this by placing links on their websites to the Amazon homepage or to specific products.  If a referral results in a sale, the Associate receives a commission from Amazon.  By the end of 2003, Amazon had signed up almost one million Associates.  Associates can access the Amazon catalogue directly on their websites by using the [[Amazon Web Services]] (AWS) [[XML]] service.  Amazon was the first online business to set up an Associates program.  The idea has since been copied by many other online businesses.  <br/>-<br/>-Amazon bought the [[Internet Movie Database]] (IMDb) in April [[1998]], a move that upset a number of its longtime users; the transformation of IMDb from a public-domain, nonprofit site to a commercial venture was seen as a slap in the face to many Internet users.  However, the IMDb has continued to grow and prosper.<br/>-<br/>-Amazon bought [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]-based [[PlanetAll]] in August 1998 for 800,000 shares of Amazon stock. PlanetAll operated a Web-based address book, calendar, and reminder service.  In the same deal, Amazon acquired Sunnyvale-based [[Junglee.com]], an [[XML]]-based [[data-mining]] startup for 1.6 million shares of Amazon stock.  The two deals together were valued at about $280 million at the time.  Most staff of both firms were absorbed by Amazon in early 1999.  These employees went on to build community-focused features for the Amazon Web site, including Amazon.com Auctions, Amazon.com Marketplace, Friends & Favorites, and Purchase Circles.  <br/>-<br/>-Amazon.com launched Amazon.com Auctions, its own Internet auctions service, in March 1999.  However it failed to chip away at industry pioneer [[eBay]]'s juggernaut growth.  Amazon Auctions was followed by the launch of a fixed-price marketplace business called [[zShops]] in September 1999, and a failed [[Sotheby's]]/Amazon partnership called [[sothebys.amazon.com]] in November.  Although zShops failed to live up to its expectations, it laid the groundwork for the hugely successful [[Amazon Marketplace]] service launched in 2001 that let customers sell used books, CDs, DVDs, and other products alongside new items. Amazon Marketplace's main rivals today is eBay's [[half.com]] service. <br/>-<br/>-In June 1999, Amazon bought [[Alexa Internet]], [[Accept.com]], and [[Exchange.com]] in a set of deals worth approximately $645 million.<br/>-<br/>-In [[2002]], Amazon became the exclusive retailer for the much-hyped [[Segway HT|Segway Human Transporter]].  Bezos was an early supporter of the Segway before its details were made public.<br/>-<br/>-Search Inside the Book is a feature which makes it possible for customers to search for keywords in the full text of many books in the catalog. The feature started out with 120,000 titles (or 33 million pages of text) on [[October 23]], [[2003]]. There are currently about 250,000 books in the program. Amazon has cooperated with around 130 [[publisher]]s to allow users to perform these searches. To avoid copyright violations, Amazon.com does not return the computer-readable text of the book but rather a picture of the page containing the found excerpt, disables printing of the pages, and puts limits on the number of pages in a book a single user can access. Amazon is planning to launch Search Inside the Book internationally.<br/>-<br/>-In 2004, Amazon purchased [[Joyo.com]], a Chinese e-commerce Web site. It also debuted [http://www.a9.com/ A9.com], a company focused on researching, and building innovative [[technology]].  One of the technologies A9.com was working on was a [[search engine]] with a "Search Inside the Book" feature allowing users to search within the text of books as well as searching for text on the Web. Another A9.com technology was its "Find It on the Block" feature allowing users to find not just the phone number, address, map, and directions for a business; but to see a picture of it, and all the businesses and shops on that same street.<br/>-<br/>-Also in 2004, Amazon launched its "Presidential Candidates" feature, whereby customers could donate from $5 to $200 to the campaigns of [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|U.S. presidential hopefuls]], resurrecting the Amazon Honor System for the purpose. The Honor System was originally launched in 2001 as a way for Amazon customers to "tip" their "favorite Web sites and to buy digital content on the Web," Amazon collecting 2.9% of the payment plus a flat fee of 30 cents. It has never been shut down, but had fallen into relative disuse.<br/>-<br/>-At the end of the year, with the catastrophic [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|earthquake and tsunami in the Indian Ocean]], Amazon set up an online donation channel to the [[American Red Cross]] using the Honor System, waiving its processing fee. As of [[January 3]], [[2005]], over 162,000 individuals had donated over $13.1 million in this way. The same week, Amazon created similar channels for the [[British Red Cross|British]], [[Canadian Red Cross|Canadian]], French, [[German Red Cross|German]] and [[Japanese Red Cross|Japanese]] [[Red Cross]] organisations via its international sites. Over 7,000 Britons donated over $350,000; over 900 Canadians, over $56,000; over 660 French, over $23,000; over 2,900 Germans, over $145,000; and over 1,900 Japanese, over $66,000.<br/>-<br/>-Amazon reactivated its Red Cross donation channel when [[Hurricane Katrina]] struck at the end of August, 2005. As of [[September 8]], over 98,000 payments had been made totaling over $10.7 million.<br/>-<br/>-Amazon added a [[wiki]] feature to their product database: every product has a wiki section.<br/>-<br/>-==Patent controversies==<br/>-The company has been controversial for its use of [[patent]]s as an alleged hindrance to competitors. The "[[one click patent]]" is perhaps the best-known example of this. Amazon's use of the one-click patent against competitor [[Barnes and Noble]]'s website led the [[Free Software Foundation]] to announce a [[boycott]] on Amazon in December [[1999]] [http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=1999-12-22-001-05-NW-LF].  The boycott was discontinued in September [[2002]] [http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/amazon.html].<br/>-<br/>-On [[February 25]], [[2003]], the company was granted a patent titled "Method and system for conducting a discussion relating to an item on [[Internet forum|Internet discussion board]]s."<br/>-<br/>-==Other controversies==<br/>-===Customer service phone number===<br/>-Amazon.com has caused frustration among those wishing for more active customer support. Its little-advertised [[customer service]] [[phone number]] in the U.S., (800) 201-7575 (and 81-11-808-3210 in Japan),is hard to find because Amazon's help pages omit contact numbers and ask customers to send their questions via e-mail. However, Amazon customers also have the option of submitting their phone numbers and receiving a call from Amazon customer service. <br/>-<br/>-Amazon's customer service policy has been standard over the years despite complaints. Some customers consider person-to-person communication over the phone a more convenient support option, as opposed to e-mail, which can take hours or days to be acted upon. Of course, complaints about customer service are not unique to Amazon; many large web-oriented enterprises draw complaints about meager, ineffective, and outsourced customer support. However, Amazon's size and prominence in e-commerce has drawn a lot of focus to its policies and has prompted others to create Web sites for the sole purpose of distributing the appropriate customer service numbers. To understand the extent of customer dissatisfaction with this policy, it's worth noting that such a web page with Amazon contact numbers received in excess of 23,000 visits in December 2004 alone.[http://clicheideas.com/amazon.htm]<br/>-<br/>-==Labor relations==<br/>-Saying that they were frustrated with low wages, lack of advancement opportunities, and poor treatment, Amazon.com workers at eight distribution centers sought to join the [[United Food and Commercial Workers]] (UFCW) in December 2000. Meanwhile, the [[Communications Workers of America]] undertook a campaign to unionize some 400 customer-service representatives in Seattle. Amazon.com management embarked on an aggressive counter-campaign that included shutting down its Seattle service center. [http://news.com.com/2100-1017-808013.html] [http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=311]. Amazon.com suceeeded in stalling the unions' efforts in part by appealing to workers' fear of finding jobs at the end of the [[dot com]] boom.

Other common images include a different owl with '''"YA RLY"''' ('''"Yeah, really"'''). The usual conversation flow, including the meme, starts with O RLY?, followed by YA RLY!, then sometimes ending with the NO WAI! owl. An additional exchange of SRSLY? SRSLY! (seriously) or YA WAI! (yeah way) is sometimes incorporated. <br/>-<br/>-Its usage is usually [[sarcasm|sarcastic]]; some have suggested that O RLY mocks [[America Online|AOL]] speak.

Only 9% of the these participants had received theraputic care previous to this study. There conclusion was: "Psychological illness already present before the TM phase worsened considerably. TM can cause mental illness or at the very least prepare the way for the onset of mental illness." [http://www.freedomofmind.com/resourcecenter/groups/t/tm/tmgerman.htm]. The study group was 67 persons with direct or indirect connection with TM. 27 of the group had practised TM, with the others either parents or spouses of a practitioner. According the paper, the subjects all either reported a negative experience with the practice of TM or had rejected the organization of the TM and its representatives.[http://www.agpf.de/TM-Bensheim1.htm]<br/>+<br/>+This is the paragraph that was removed. Moreover, the Skeptic organization website only reported that study without any form of review. The reputability of the skeptic organization website '''as a publisher''' can reasonably be disputed and we will need a consensus about whether or not it is a reputable source before we can accept it for inclusion. Typically website do not count as a reputable source. In other words, the report of the Skeptic organization can also be considered as a self-published source: it is their own report in their own website.

The website is a German "anti-cult" site. The youth organisation may well still exist since it was a church youth group.- Paul<br/>+<br/>+: Who was the publisher? A print is a publication if it is brought to the public attention. I am not sure that an internal report is really a way to bring a study to the public attention, and thus I dispute the fact that it is a publication.   However, even if we consider it as a publication, we have a bigger issue here. The policy is specific that it must be a '''credible third-party''' publication. --[[User:Lumiere|Lumière]] 14:41, 10 February 2006 (UTC) <br/>+<br/>+:: That's not accurate.

The German Church has a long history of discriminating against any group that does not "belong" to the church - at last count over 250 groups and individuals were on their black-list. Interstingly enough in 1999 a German Govt Commission came to the conclusion that at present cults presented no danger to soceity (Chapter 6.1 page 374).Paul<br/>+<br/>+: Thanks a lot. This is indeed very useful. Editors are encouraged to evaluate the credibility of sources. Original research is not accepted in an Wikipedia article, but evaluating the credibility of the sources is not original research and is in fact necessary. Very useful! --[[User:Lumiere|Lumière]] 15:09, 10 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+<br/>+::: Sorry to be "nit-picking" but I disagree with the statement "According the paper, the subjects all either reported a negative experience with the practice of TM or had rejected the organization of the TM and its representatives." The document clearly states that the starting point for all those questioned was a negative experience etc"  Here is the wording from the original "Die gemeinsame Ausgangslage für alle war eine negative Erfahrung mit der Praxis der Meditation oder ihren Folgen bzw. eine ablehnende Haltung zur Organisation der TM und ihren Vertretern. "  Ausgangslage means "starting point" or "Initial position". I think it should be included that they all had this position before taking part in the study. - Thanks ..Paul<br/>+<br/>+:::: Though this study does not have a reputable source and thus is not acceptable for inclusion in  Wikipedia in accordance with WP policy, I am interested to see what it really says. What would be your proposed sentences? Are you suggesting to add a sentence or to modify the current sentences? --[[User:Lumiere|Lumière]] 15:21, 10 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::: Please demonstrate that the society for youth and culture is not a reputabble source.[[User:Sethie|Sethie]] 15:50, 10 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+:::: The society is most likely a reputable society in Germany otherwise it would not have received money from the German government. The issue here is not the reputability of the society, but whether it can be used as a source.  The policy is very clear that, if you want to include the view of an organization, irrespectively of the reputability of this organization, this organization must have published its view in a reputable third-party publication. This means that self-published source are not accepted as reputable source. The exception is when the view is about the organization itself. In this case, this view can be included in an article about the organization. --[[User:Lumiere|Lumière]] 17:05, 10 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+::::: That's not what the policy says.

I just feel that since the authors state in Section 2.2 of their profile of those that responded to their questionaire that they already had a negative view of TM, then this should be included if this source remains. It certainly shows that this was not a neutral study. Something like "At the start of the study all those questioned expressed negative experiences of TM or its organisation ". Thank you for accepting the correction to the source of the study. With regard to the study it was a self-published broschure. - Paul<br/>+<br/>+== Refactoring the talk page.  ==<br/>+<br/>+I suggest that we do as suggested in [[wikipedia:refactoring_talk_pages]].

Forget about the fact that it is a refactoring. Me and others are allowed to write what we think is useful in this talk page. You could argue that you do not want the active version to be refactored (because you like it long and you don't want anything to be cut), but now that you have archived it, you cannot object to it anymore. Creating an archive for the  original version is a part of refactoring. You just helped the process. Thanks! --[[User:Lumiere|Lumière]] 14:53, 10 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+I created the page [[Talk:Transcendental meditation/Refactoring]]. Please feel free to extract any important point from the archives to this refactoring page. Read [[wikipedia:refactoring_talk_pages]] for instructions about refactoring.

This will be very useful for those who come visit the page and want to find out the important issues. --[[User:Lumiere|Lumière]] 15:03, 10 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+== Please remove the paragraphs about the German's study ==<br/>+<br/>+These paragraphs about the german study clearly violate WP:verifiability policy. If there is an edit war (say with Hipocrite that keeps putting them back), be careful not to remove these paragraphs more than three times in 24 hours because you will violate the three-revert rule ([[WP:3RR]]). Also, carefully check for discussion in the talk page. The goal is to achieve a consensus. If there is a consensus either way, go with the consensus. However, right now Hypocryte is simply acting without discussing in the talk page. Therefore, do not hesitate to remove these paragraphs while respecting the 3RR rule. --[[User:Lumiere|Lumière]] 15:34, 10 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+: The booklet was published, it is noted in the german government statements.

While I deny this is a source of dubious reliability, "Sometimes a statement can only be found in a publication of dubious reliability, such as a tabloid newspaper. If the statement is relatively unimportant, remove it. If it is important enough to keep, attribute it to the source in question. For example: "According to the British tabloid newspaper The Sun ..."

There are only two possibilities: self-publishing or third-party publishing. If an organisation does not use a third-party publisher, then it is self-publishing.  This is the case for both the German society and the skeptic organization. Very simple. --[[User:Lumiere|Lumière]] 02:36, 11 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+I've just spent some time looking over the two references cited for this study. One is on the website of a man claiming to "rescue" people from cults and mind control (definitely not an unbiased source). The second cite is not in English, which goes against the [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (links)#Foreign-language sites|Wikipedia style guide]] because the subject of the article itself is not a German topic, and there are no relevant maps or charts that can be discerned from the information provided. I'm no big proponent of meditation or anything, but this seems like clear bias to me. If there are more English-language references or examples, you should feel free to put them in, but in this case the verifiability is extremely shaky and the section should (in my humble opinion) be removed. [[User:Kafziel|Kafziel]] 16:43, 10 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+: Thanks to express just common sense, which turns out to be policy! --[[User:Lumiere|Lumière]] 16:50, 10 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+<br/>+::: Could Hipocrite please give me the references to support his statement that "The booklet was published, it is noted in the german government statements". I know of know German Govt statements concerning this study. The study was done by a German Christian Organisation who published their own findings. Unfortunately for most of you the only reliable copy of this is available in German on the site of the leading anti-cult veteran Ingo Heinemann, who had nothing to do with the research. I can confirm that he has on his website a copy of the original research, but as I said elsewhere you will need it translating. Its scientific basis and conclusions are debatable since it was undertaken with a small group of people already dissatified with TM and some of the conclusions are based on people's opinions. - Paul<br/>+<br/>+:::: Bundesverwaltungsgericht ruling May 24, 1989 in Case number 7 C 2.87.

It seems you may have just taken information off a website in English that carries only limited facts. In 1980 the TM organisation successfully won a case against the German Govt prohibiting it from presenting false, negative statements about TM. This was based on testimony of independent expert witnesses who found no danger in TM.   In 1989 the Govt appeal case (which is the one you mention here) had this decision revised – not on the basis of any new information that TM was dangerous , but based on the Govts claim that it had reduced its warnings about TM but retained the right to warn unstable people that TM may be dangerous for them (even though nothing was presented to support this.) Since the Govt no longer warns the TM organisation has not pursued its own outsatnding appeal against this revision. The Govt gave no more warnings about TM and in 1999 a German Govt Commission came to the conclusion that at the present time cults in the country present no danger to society. It seems your source just mixed up information from different sources. 1+1 =4 Source http://www.agpf.de/Bundesverfassungsgericht-1BvR881-89.htm - easier than the complecated journey thriough the Bundes site .. Paul<br/>+<br/>+:::Great input, Paul, thank you. So legitimacy can't really be lent to the government's decision because a) since it was an appeal, clearly the courts have varied their rulings in the past, b) the government, although winning their appeal, has still not resumed warnings so evidently they don't feel too strongly about it, and c) even the government's eventual victory is on yet another appeal. If this subject is going to be used at all, it should only be to state that TM is a contentious issue in Germany (and perhaps sum up the situation as you did, above). [[User:Kafziel|Kafziel]] 19:22, 10 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:::: I suppose that we can talk about what happens in between the TMO and the German govt, but the scientific study should not be the main point because it has no reputable source. --[[User:Lumiere|Lumière]] 22:38, 10 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::: Whoops, now someone has taken the whole thing out and replaced it with "In a 1989 decision, the Bundesverwaltungsgericht of then-Western Germany made a determination that Trancendental Meditation can "cause psychic defects or destruction of personality."<br/>+This was not the ruling at all!! Also it was not the Bundesverwaltungsgericht (deals with administrative law)but the Bundesverfassungsgericht (deals with constitutional law). In other words the Govt did not appeal to the normal courts (where it had already lost) but to the constitutional court and argued under its rights as a Govt. As I stated above the ruling was that the Govt could warn unstable people that TM could cause psychical damage in the same way as other life events could... the Court specifically mentions other life events for such people as being "engaement, marriage, armed service, job loss and also TM" (Der Ausbruch der Erkrankung setze eine entsprechende Disposition voraus (sog. vulnerable Individuen). Auslösendes Element könne jedes Ereignis sein, das die ganze Person in Anspruch nehme, eine Verlobung, eine Heirat, eine Niederkunft, ein Militärdienst und auch TM. ) In all honesty can that really be interpreted as it now stands on the intro page? I would suggest contacted someone familiar with German law before allowing such a layman's interpretation to be included. - Paul<br/>+<br/>+:Paul, what is your relation to the TM organization? [[User:Hipocrite|Hipocrite]] - [[User talk:Hipocrite|&laquo;<small>Talk</small>&raquo;]] 19:51, 10 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+<br/>+I said in one of my earlier postings that I practise TM. I live in Germany and am very familiar with events here. I have tried to just focus on the facts concerning the issue .. I had no objection to either the Bensheimer study being mentioned or the court case, just that the information was not correct in my opinion. All the best Paul<br/>+<br/>+I've changed the wording of the German section with a large warning tag stating that we need sources (English ones, particularly). I've kept the German link there for now, for lack of a better option. At this point I have no reason to believe Paul's summation is untrue; it can certainly be reviewed by other German speaking Wikipedians. The section seems pretty NPOV to me at this point, but still lacks verifiability (in English, at least).  [[User:Kafziel|Kafziel]] 20:05, 10 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:  We would be against policy to include the German study only on the basis that it was published somewhere. It must be published with a credible third-party publisher. A WP article is not just a place to provide all information that we feel is true and seems relevant. It may seem that we will obtain a nice NPOV debate, with all sides presented, but NPOV is not the only criteria. Every side must be carefully checked agaisnt No Original Research and Verifiability. If as a result, one side loses some content, let it be so because it just means that this content was not well sourced and was perhaps simply wrong. This is not against NPOV. It is not up to us to evaluate whether the content is accurate and fair. This is the job of the publisher, and this is why it must be a reputable third-party publisher.  --[[User:Lumiere|Lumière]] 22:38, 10 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:::In principle I have no great objection, except that, to my knowledge there is no Govt list and the warning only applies to certain unstable people who could be affected in the same way by marriage etc .. it is not that marriage, engagement or TM are on any list but that these were mentioned in the court ruling. So maybe it still needs some tweaking to reflect thsi.Also in 1999 the Governments own Enquete Commission into "Cults" in general (TM was also included in their survey) found that cults do not present a great danger to soceity at this time  Enquete-Kommission<br/>+"Sogenannte Sekten und Psychogruppen" - can be downloaded as pdf at http://www.bundestag.de/ftp/ftp_archiv_13.html#enqsekten. (English version also available) Since that time the Govt has kept a low profile in such matters. - Paul<br/>+<br/>+:I've changed the wording so it doesn't imply that there is some official "list". I also included the cite to the decision about cults, etc. I think this section is starting to look halfway decent. What say we all take a little break from the frantic editing of today, stand back a little bit, and see if we can get a little bit of input from some other editors? [[User:Kafziel|Kafziel]] 21:02, 10 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+:::::::.Rock on .. it's getting late here in Germany and over the weekend I want to enjoy the snow:-) ::::::::::: I am trying to find an official version of the court case for you in english .. but may not be available .. certainly does not seem to be one on the relevant sites for German courts ... Nice to "meet" you all -Paul<br/>+<br/>+Actually, the paragraph on Dr. Otis study is not reflecting the content of the paper anymore. It is getting worst. There is obviously an important alternative presented by Dr. Otis, and this has been dropped. There is only one way we can present Dr. Otis study and it is to present all the possible explanations for the observations made in the study. Otherwise, it is a biased POV. I am also checking the sources for Dr. Otis study to see of it was published with a reputable third-party publisher, i.e., some reputable journal. --[[User:Lumiere|Lumière]] 22:38, 10 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+== Dr Otis study: in a book published by a general publisher.  ==<br/>+<br/>+We might need to check it more carefully, but it seems that Dr Otis study only appeared in a book that was published by a general publisher. The standard for scientific research is a peer-reviewed journal. If it is not a peer-reviewed journal, it better have a pretty good reputation in the subject area.  Even with a reputable publisher, a book has a very low reputability because the editors of the book can essentially publish whatever they want in this book. At the least, if we have a reputable publisher for the book, the subject of the book and the editors will be carefully chosen.  The publisher was  Aldine Publishing Company.  I tried to find out more about this publisher and it was not easy. There was not much on the web about this publisher. I think it was started in Germany, but not sure. After some research, I found this website http://www.philsp.com/data/data302.html, in which we can see that the publisher also publishes children's book.  This is very strange. I never seen that before. It must be a mistake.  Until we have further information, we have to consider that the study was not published in a reputable source. If we get back to the previous NPOV version (the one we had before Hipocrite dropped everything that was in favor of TM), it will make more sense that we keep it in this article until we find out more about the publisher. [[User:Lumiere|Lumière]] 23:21, 10 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+: Go get the book out of a library. It's neither a childrens book nor a general interest book. The publisher is in Hawthorne, New York. Go look up "Aldine de Gruyter," the current name for the imprint. [[User:Hipocrite|Hipocrite]] - [[User talk:Hipocrite|&laquo;<small>Talk</small>&raquo;]] 01:07, 11 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:: I was not talking about the book, but the publisher. Anyway, you are telling me that the publisher has a new name. So, I have to check again. [[User:Lumiere|Lumière]] 01:20, 11 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:::: I agree with Hipocrite. Wikipedia's standards are '''not''' the same as scientific research standards. Take a look at some other articles' sources - [[comic book]]s, [[fanzine]]s, [[website]]s, etc. If it's independently verifiable, it counts. We don't need to see the publisher's credentials. That's why we have a [[Wikipedia:Risk disclaimer|content disclaimer]]. [[User:Kafziel|Kafziel]] 01:28, 11 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::::: This is not what the poliocy says. It says that what is a reputable source depends on the type of contents. It also says that it is preferable to have a peer-reviewed journal for scientific content. And, of course, the policy requires that we evaluate the sources, which is needed if it is not a peer-reviewed journal. If we don't agree on the policy, we will not have consensus.    [[User:Lumiere|Lumière]] 01:37, 11 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+::::: Of course the Wikipedia standards are not the same as for a scientific journal. They are only stronger for scientific contents. We do not accept original research, whereas a scientific journal does. An encyclopedia should have a higher standard. A scientific theory that was just published in one reputable journal but with no follow-up will not normally find its place in an encyclopedia. We accept them in Wikîpedia, but still we do not have lower standards, except when it is misinterpreted. [[User:Lumiere|Lumière]] 01:44, 11 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+::::: You confuse a broader range of topics with lower standards. We have a broader range of topics, which means that we need different standards for different types of contents. However, we certainly do not have lower standards for any of these types of contents. [[User:Lumiere|Lumière]] 01:50, 11 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+I checked the publisher that Hipocrite mentioned and the book "Meditation: Classic and Contemporary Perspectives" do not show up when you use their search engine.

[[User:Kafziel|Kafziel]] 21:23, 11 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+: I know you do consider this as vandalism, and it may be true that you are not alone. This happens all the times when people are in serious disagreement. Tell me exactly why Hipocrite can completely destroy a serious amount of work that reported on Dr. Otis study, and then you conclude every thing is great, but when I remove a small paragraph, which obviously made no sense,  it is vandalism? Maybe you should think about the possibility that you have your own POV.  -[[User:Lumiere|Lumière]] 22:02, 11 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+::I have absolutely no POV on the subject. I'm only here because a request was made for a third opinion. Hipocrite was also asked not to make substantial changes until we can reach some consent. The vandalism warning I gave you was valid, and as you have just made clear your edit was not in good faith but rather a spiteful retaliation to Hipocrite's changes. [[User:Kafziel|Kafziel]] 01:23, 12 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+== About request for citations in the Dr Otis paragraph ==<br/>+Sethie, The required citation for each of your request is already given. There is no need to cite it each time. I think that you misinterpret the Verifiability and No origibal research policies. These policies do not say that the content that is sourced  must correspond words for words to the sources. The criteria for no original research is that the content that is sourced is totally backed by the sources, not that it is there words for words. --[[User:Lumiere|Lumière]] 23:25, 11 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+<br/>+I believe somehow some ideas that are not contained with Dr. Otit's study got mixed in with that paragraph. <br/>+<br/>+Please provide a source which says:<br/>+~However, his conclusion was in fact an explanatory conclusion or explanation, not a logical conclusion <br/>+~The MAIN observation which brought him to this explanatory conclusion<br/>+~An alternative explanation for this same obvervation<br/>+~The alternative explanation, blaming on prior conditions, appears more supported by direct evidence than Dr. Otis proposed explanatory conclusion<br/>+etc.<br/>+<br/>+All of these things sound to me like COMMENTARY on Dr. Otis' study.... Please prove me wrong by showing me that these are Dr. Otis' ideas themselves, and not someone stating what THEY think about his research.

[[User:Sethie|Sethie]] 00:37, 12 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+All of these provide a direct description of the paper. Again, there is no requirement to provide exact quotes. There are observations described in the paper and I report them. There are many alternative explanations for these observations and I report them. This is not a biased report of the paper: this is exactly what the paper does.  The fact that one of these explanations is presented as a conclusion is also reported. This is a totally faithful description of the paper. Are you trying to hide some parts of the paper, and the role that these parts have in the paper? <br/>+<br/>+Anyway, this paragraph is only there until we obtain more information about the reputability of the source. If there is nothing to establish the reputability of the source, clearly this study will be removed. Therefore, instead of arguing against a faithful description of the paper, you should focus on establishing the reputability of its source. -[[User:Lumiere|Lumière]] 01:00, 12 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+<br/>+I take your response as being- "I will not provide sources." Hence I will remove those statements. [[User:Sethie|Sethie]] 01:13, 12 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:It was pure OR.

This single word expresses a very strong opinion. Like any other viewpoint, it should be notable, verifiable and attributed. Your three cites might be enough for the verifiability requirement (it depends on the reputability of these sources). However, it does not address the notability requirement. Such a view must be notable: there must be prominent adherents. Also, the sentence does not mention who says that this organization is controversial: this view must be attributed.  In other words, it is totally innapropriate to try to pass such a strong view just like that by inserting the word "controversial". --[[User:Lumiere|Lumière]] 03:21, 12 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+==What are you trying to achieve here?==<br/>+<br/>+Sorry for interrupting, but I think this subject serves as an excellent example that relates to foundational questions about NPOV itself. Meditation is a subjective experience that is inherently non-scientific, however, it is interesting to understand its "objective" effects from a scientific, empirical perspective.<br/>+<br/>+What "truth" should this article present? will it be the subjective "truth" of the meditator, who is confident over the positive effects meditation has over their lives? or will it be the "truth" of the scientist, who is approaching the subject with [[empiricist]] methods?<br/>+<br/>+The answer, as reflected from the article, is that the empiricist approach is predominantly more important. My question is: but isn't that bias toward [[positivism]]? yes, of course it is. This is the sort of problems NPOV cannot handle. A TM practitioner ''defines'' the subject differently from a scientist.<br/>+<br/>+But what is the "correct" approach? answer: '''there is no "correct" approach'''. A scientist will never accept subjective experience as evidence, and a practitioner will not accept scientific research that trys to falsify their subjective experience. What you seem to be doing here is trying to synthetically "balance" Pro and Con [[positivist]] interpretations of scientific research on the subject.<br/>+<br/>+As I told [[User_talk:Larry Sanger|Larry Sanger]], NPOV is "inherently wrong". You have been misled. Different viewpoints ''define'' the subject differently (even if only slightly, in some cases), there is no place for a real compromise. An attempt for a "forced" synthesis creates a result that may appeal to all sides, '''within the context of the debate''', but may consequently distort the meaning of both sides. As I told Sanger, NPOV is '''process oriented''', it seems to work because people are willing for a compromise, but they really shouldn't as the end result may incorrectly falsify both sides. --[[User:Anon84.x|Anon84.x]] 15:38, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</td>

The series is named after the main character, Inuyasha. Inuyasha was in [[Shogakukan]]'s [[Shonen Sunday]] (Shūkan Shōnen Sunday). The name "Inuyasha" literally means "Dog night part Demon". ''[[wiktionary:inu|Inu]]'' "dog" + "night" "Part demon" from Japanese kanji ''ya'',"sha" derived from masculine [[Sanskrit]] ''yaksha'', Rumiko Takashi said during an interview that "yasha" meant "forest spirit". The full title is 戦国お伽草子ー犬夜叉 ([[Rōmaji]]: ''Sengoku o-togi zōshi Inuyasha''), which roughly translates to ''''Inuyasha, A [[feudalism|Feudal]] [[Fairy tale|Fairy Tale]]''''.<br/>+<br/>+A female junior high school student, [[Kagome Higurashi]], falls through a well ending up in the [[Sengoku Period|Warring States Period]]. There she meets a [[han'yō]] (half human and half [[yōkai]] (demon) named Inuyasha. The two are trying to get the shards of the "Shikon Jewel" before they fall into the wrong hands.<br/>+InuYasha is intended for ages twelve and up, because it does contain mild language, and mild fantasy violence.<br/>+<br/>+== Overview ==<br/>+{{spoiler}}<br/>+<br/>+<br/>+[[Kagome Higurashi]] is an ordinary girl who is somehow pulled into an old well at her family's [[Shinto]] shrine by a mysterious force, sending her back in time 500 years to the feudal era. (The time where Inuyasha lives). During the time slip, a youkai claims that Kagome possesses the ("Shikon Jewel") and attempts to seize it.  The girl fights back and when she climbs out, she finds herself in the Warring States Period of Japan, where both humans and youkai reside.<br/>+<br/>+She is quickly recognized as the reincarnation of the miko Kikyo by [[Kaede]], an elderly miko who happens to be Kikyo's younger sister.  Youkai are immediately drawn to Kagome and she flees into the forest to save the villagers who have taken her in.  Her presence causes a strange boy pinned to an sacred tree by an arrow to awake.  He is Inuyasha, a Hanyou (half-human, half-demon) and recognizes Kagome as Kikyo, the priestess who sealed him to the tree. In order to combat the youkai, despite Kaede's warnings, Kagome frees Inuyasha from the Genbouku god-tree.<br/>+<br/>+However, the youkai manages to attack Kagome and remove an object from Kagome's body, the Shikon Jewel.  While the youkai is easily destroyed, it is Kagome's duty to protect the jewel from both youkai and corrupt humans who seek to use it to gain power - including Inuyasha, who desires to use the jewel in order to become a Youkai (a full demon).<br/>+<br/>+However, when the jewel is shattered, Kagome and Inuyasha must team up to recover the shards before they get into the wrong hands.  While they gain valuable allies along the way with the monk (Houshi) [[Miroku (InuYasha)|Miroku]], youkai exterminator (taijiya) [[Sango (Inuyasha)|Sango]], and fox-Youkai (kitsune) [[Shippo]], they find adversaries in Inuyasha's older brother [[Sesshomaru]], a resurrected [[Kikyo]], and the malicious demon [[Naraku]].<br/>+<br/>+==Explanation of time travel==<br/>+[[Image:ShikonNoTama.jpg|thumb|The [[Jewel of Four Souls|Jewel of the Four Souls (Shikon no Tama)]].]]<br/>+<br/>+<br/>+<br/>+The well always transports Kagome by the same amount of time. That is to say, if she spends a week in the Sengoku period, a week has also passed when she returns home.<br/>+<br/>+[[Image:InuyashaTimeline.JoshG.jpg|A timeline of the initial story of InuYasha.]]<br/>+<br/>+The group of four heroes travel all over the land of Japan to destroy Naraku, because Miroku, Sango and InuYasha want revenge.<br/>+<br/>+==Title dispute==<br/>+There is a long-standing debate about the proper English spelling of "Inuyasha", the title character's name. Variant spellings include "Inuyasha", "InuYasha", "Inu Yasha", and "Inu-Yasha". Fans of the series often use "IY" (or less rarely, "Inu"), especially on fansites, although it is considered to be more of an abbreviation than an actual name. Since Japanese does not use spacing or capitalization, there is no "correct" spelling. So far, the 'official' spelling is "Inuyasha", but fandom inertia (such as at fanfiction.net, where Inuyasha has a massive fanbase that grows more or less hourly) has largely held on to "Inuyasha". This may be in part to the fact that none of the other characters in the series has names with multiple capitals & the Japanese English logo used for the movies. Since 'Inuyasha' translates to 'Dogdemon' (see article head), InuYasha (DogDemon) clarifies the amalgamation of the name.<br/>+<br/>+This is, again, overkill because there are no capitals in Japanese. Separating the name (Inu Yasha) is more easily readable but may confuse english speakers--Inuyasha is the character's given name, and he does not offer a family name.<br/>+<br/>+Cartoon Network, the US anime licensee, and Viz Media which publishes the English version of the manga and produces the English dub of the anime use "InuYasha" (Viz formerly used "Inu-Yasha" in the title but switched to the current "InuYasha". Viz still uses the spelling "Inu-Yasha" in the text of the graphic novels). This is an example of the disputes that often arise with romanization. In Japan though, it’s spelled Inuyasha.<br/>+<br/>+<br/>+==Popularity==<br/>+Since its introduction on [[Cartoon Network]]'s [[Adult Swim]] block in August 2002, the ranks of ''Inuyasha'' fans have swelled to the point where most fans call the program a "cult" and its fans "rabid zealots". The show is so popular that, although it has been taken off the air many times in its run (in order to make way for shows such as ''[[Kikaider]]'', ''[[The Big O]]'', and ''[[FLCL]]''), it has always been reinstated due to the demands of viewers. After a while, Adult Swim's producers and programmers became sarcastic about this, and it became something of a running joke that they were on the side of the viewers, but were at the mercy of superior departments. Practically speaking, the hiatus are likely necessary to give [[Viz Media]] time to dub enough episodes far enough in advance to allow for a several-month-long uninterrupted run.<br/>+<br/>+As time progressed, the show was moved to increasingly later viewing hours. In August 2002, it aired at 11:00 PM. In March 2004, it aired at 12:30 AM. In January 2006, Cartoon Network resumed showing new episodes Tuesday nights at 12:30 AM, although repeats are no longer shown. Presumably, the logic behind this is that the fans will not mind staying up later, and other shows can be put between them and their goal. However, the show has proven to be a slightly more mainstream hit in other countries such as on [[YTV]] in Canada, where it is one of the station's highest rated programs running on weeknights at 11:05 PM and the "newest" episode on Fridays at 9 PM. Its popularity has also spread to Latin America where it runs on weekday afternoons.<br/>+<br/>+There are many possible reasons for the popularity of the ''Inuyasha'' series. A likely one is that it is eclectic, including elements from many different genres. At first, the series mainly appears to be action-oriented, and it does indeed have a significant amount of action, with at least one confrontation with an enemy in most episodes. However, it also includes a great deal of comedy (frequently slapstick), many monsters that add notes of the horror genre, and occasional romance. Another probable reason that ''Inuyasha'' is so popular is that it has rather sympathetic characters who are varied enough that most people can relate to at least one of them.<br/>+<br/>+Other criticisms include the sheer length of the series in both anime and manga form dragging out certain story points past credibility. Similar to ''Ranma ½'', Takahashi has sometimes been accused by fans of being unable to finish a story effectively; others cite this is merely a desire of the animators and publishers to continue a still-lucrative franchise, as is the case with many other shōnen titles.<br/>+<br/>+Although not an "adult" series, the show airs in this slot due to some occasional, middle to mild violence scenes, such as the one on the first episode where Inuyasha is impaled against a tree.<br/>+<br/>+The series will end its run in Cartoon Network in 2006. However, as no conclusion were included in its plot, and the manga's story is still not finished, there is belief that someday the series's production can be resumed, a fact not uncommon in long running anime series like this one.<br/>+<br/>+== Characters ==<br/>+<!--Keep this section short and sweet.--><br/>+===Inuyasha's Group===<br/>+;'''[[Inuyasha (character)|Inuyasha]]''' (犬夜叉)<br/>+:The male [[protagonist]], a hybrid of a dog demon and a human (called a "hanyōu" in Japanese, meaning half-demon and half-human). He has a tendency for massive regeneration after fights from injuries which would kill most people. It is unknown if this is demon powers or a deus ex machina effect. <br/>+;'''[[Kagome Higurashi]]''' (日暮かごめ ''Higurashi Kagome'')<br/>+:The female protagonist and a third year middle school student. In the tradition of many Rumiko Takahashi heroines ([[Akane Tendo]], [[Maison Ikkoku|Kyoko Otonashi]]), Kagome can be extremely sweet.<br/>+:Inuyasha wears a special bead necklace (known as the Beads of Subjugation) which only responds to Kagome's command: when she yells "Sit!" ("Osuwari!") or "Sit, boy!" Inuyasha is thrown to the ground. Kagome is known to abuse this power sometimes.<br/>+;'''[[Miroku (Inuyasha)|Miroku]]''' (弥勒)<br/>+:A Buddhist monk who suffers from a inherited curse that was first visited on his grandfather by Naraku when he was fighting him. This curse created a gaping hole in the palm of his hand (''kazāna'' or "wind tunnel"). While Kazāna is a powerful weapon against demons, if Kazāna absorbs Naraku's large, poisonous bees (Sainyosho), he becomes poisoned. If the Kazāna is not removed by defeating Naraku, then the Kazāna will one day absorb Miroku himself - this was how his father and grandfather died.<br/>+:He has questionable morals asking every pretty woman he meets to bear his child. He falls in love with Sango. <br/>+<br/>+;'''[[Sango (Inuyasha)|Sango]]''' (珊瑚)<br/>+:A demon slayer ("youkai taijiya") who hails from a village of professional demon slayers. She wields the Hiraikotsu, which is a heavy 7-foot-tall tan-colored boomerang-like weapon made by Sango's father of demon bones. Sango is also a tragic victim of Naraku's evil: her entire village was destroyed by Naraku's demons.<br/>+;'''[[Kirara]]''' (雲母)<br/>+:Sango's faithful, [[nekomata]]-demon; light-tan colored fur, with black stripes on each of her bushy tails (she has two) near the tip, and black-tipped paws. Also called Kilala (pronounced "Kee-Lah-Lah") in the English dub, but spelled Kirara (r's and l's are interchangable). Kirara can change between two forms,  a ferocious youkai the size of a huge tiger with the ability to fly, and a cute little kitten. Sango often uses Kirara's flying ability in her large transformed form as transportation to keep up with Inuyasha's running and leaping ability (often with Kagome holding onto his back). As well, Miroku and Shippō also use Kirara's large transformed flying ability for transportation.<br/>+;'''[[Shippo]]''' (七宝 ''Shippō'')<br/>+:An orphaned young fox youkai (kitsune) whose father was killed by the Thunder Brothers, and the first character in the story to join Inuyasha and Kagome in their travels as a group. Shippo can shapeshift, but most of his forms look ridiculous and when he does assume a good form, he retains his tail. His other noteworthy abilities are turning into a wooden horse that can fly, leaving a trail of crying mushrooms and acorns, illusionary tricks with toys like his giant spinning top attack, using his race's patented fox fire magic, and making things like leaves or himself multiply. He tends to get into people's business a lot and he often makes cheeky comments which annoy Inuyasha. Shippo and Inuyasha have a kind of brotherly relationship, and Inuyasha often bonks him on the head so Shippo goes crying to Kagome.<br/>+<br/>+=== Supporting Characters ===<br/>+;'''[[Kaede (Inuyasha)|Kaede]]''' (楓)<br/>+:A priestess and sister of Kikyō who protected the village for fifty years after her sister's death. She is the first to recognize Kagome as the reincarnation of her sister.<br/>+;'''[[Myoga (InuYasha)|Myoga]]''' (冥加 ''Myōga'')<br/>+:A flea demon who is Inuyasha's source of information. He usually runs away from dangerous situations. He was inintially charged with protecting the remains/gravesight of Inuyasha's father which held the [[Tessaiga]]. The Grave was hidden inside the black pearl in Inuyasha's right eye. Myoga also enjoys drinking demon blood, and actually saves Inuyasha's life at one point by drinking the poison out of his blood.<br/>+;'''[[Totosai]]''' (刀々斎 ''Tōtōsai'')<br/>+:An elderly blacksmith who forged the Tetsuaiga and the [[Tenseiga]]. He rarely appears unless to repair the damage swords or instruct Inuyasha in hidden powers within the Tessaiga. Totosai can breathe Fire and wields a giant forging hammer. He also is transported by a three eyed ox which can fly. <br/>+;'''[[Hachiemon]]''' (八衛門)<br/>+:A congenial shape-shifting yōkai who has befriended Miroku. Hachi's natural appearance is a Tanuki (Raccoon Dog) demon. Hachi is short for Hachiemon.<br/>+<br/>+=== Kikyo's Group ===<br/>+;'''[[Kikyo]]''' (桔梗 ''Kikyō'')<br/>+:A priestess who loved Inuyasha and was killed by Naraku fifty years prior (in Inuyasha's time) to the story's start. She is brought back to life by the ogress Urasue. Although she looks alive, her body is still "dead," and she must ingest the souls of the dead to move.<br/>+:After a short while, Kikyo's jealousy for Kagome fades and she often appears before the group to help Inuyasha and Kagome during their adventures.<br/>+;'''[[Shinidamachu]]''' (死魂虫 ''Shinidamachū'')<br/>+:Kikyo's lesser yōkai that collect souls of the dead to sustain her life. Commonly just called "soul collectors" by fans.<br/>+<br/>+=== Sesshomaru's Group ===<br/>+;'''[[Sesshomaru]]''' (殺生丸 ''Sesshōmaru'')<br/>+:Inuyasha's callous and tenebrous older brother. Unlike Inuyasha, Sesshomaru is a yōkai and detests humans. Sesshomaru is contemptuous of Inuyasha for being han'yō, and becomes infuriated that Inuyasha inherited the sword called [[Tetsusaiga]] which has the power to kill a hundred demons at once. Instead, Sesshomaru inherited the [[Tenseiga]], a sword which cannot kill, but can bring people back to life. While fighting over the Tetsusaiga with Inuyasha, Sesshomaru loses his left arm.<br/>+:Even without an arm, Sesshomaru is an extremely strong demon who can withstand things other demons can't (e.g., the purified air of Mt. Hakurei, Mukotsu's poisons, etc.) <br/>+;'''[[Jaken]]''' (邪見)<br/>+:A demon who is Sesshōmaru's loyal but weak [[kappa]] servant, a comical character. Sesshōmaru usually treats Jaken badly, often teasing him. But Jaken willingly takes the abuse and continues to fawn over Sesshōmaru.<br/>+;'''[[Rin (Inuyasha)|Rin]]''' (りん)<br/>+:A mute (for a little while) orphan girl who discovers Sesshōmaru in the woods after he is recuperating from his big battle with Inuyasha. She brings him whatever scraps of food she can scrounge up.<br/>+;'''A'un''' (阿吽)<br/>+:A two-headed yōkai that is Rin's means for transportation.<br/>+<br/>+=== Naraku's Group ===<br/>+;'''[[Naraku]]''' (奈落)<br/>+:The main antagonist, Naraku (literally means "underworld") is a hanyō that originated from a bandit named Onigumo ("Demon Spider").<br/>+;'''[[Kagura (Inuyasha)|Kagura]]''' (神楽)<br/>+:A wind sorceress, created as the First detachment from Naraku. Although Naraku's servant, Kagura has an independent mind, and wants to be free of Naraku.<br/>+;'''[[Kanna (InuYasha)|Kanna]]''' (神無 ''Kan'na'')<br/>+:The Second detachment of Naraku, she is a yōkai who appears to be a pale little girl with white hair and clothing. She has the power to steal souls with her mirror. Her mirror also has the power to deflect weapons and can be used as a means of [[scrying]].<br/>+;'''[[Akago]]''' (赤子)<br/>+:Naraku's heart and sixth detachment, he is a baby that can possess anyone with darkness in their heart.  His main goal is to control Kagome's mind by finding pain, anger, or jealousy within her heart, and use her abilities to find the remaining shards of the Shikon jewel.<br/>+;'''[[Hakudoshi]]''' (白童子 ''Hakudōshi'')<br/>+:Created from Akago's body, he was Entei's master and looks like a 7-year-old child.  Like Naraku, his heart is not inside his body, so he is able to endlessly regenerate himself.  Created as the seventh detachment of Naraku.<br/>+;'''[[Byakuya]]''' (白夜)<br/>+:He is Naraku's latest detachment, meant to replace Kagura. He is loyal to Naraku unlike his last few detachments, and has an incredible power of creating illusions.  He travels around on a giant origami paper crane.<br/>+;'''[[Goshinki]]''' (悟心鬼)<br/>+:The third detachment from Naraku who was slain by Inuyasha's yōkai form. Before his death, his fangs broke Inuyasha's Tessaiga and released Inuyasha's yōkai state. Therefore, his fangs were used to make Sesshomaru's second sword, the Tokijin.<br/>+;'''[[Saimyosho]]''' (最猛勝 ''Saimyōshō'')<br/>+:The Saimyosho are used as spies to see what others are doing from somewhere safe. Naraku also uses them to poison Miroku if he uses his Kazāna.<br/>+;'''[[Moryomaru]]''' (魍魎丸 ''Moryōmaru'')<br/>+:One of Naraku's enemies. Due to his telepathic powers, both Kagura and Kohaku suspect he is Akago.  He is a 100-foot monster with a human shape, and can shoot blasts of energy from his arm. He was originally a soulless puppet created by Hakudoshi.<br/>+;'''[[Juromaru]]''' & '''[[Kageromaru]]''' (獣郎丸 ''Jūrōmaru'' & 影郎丸 ''Kagerōmaru'')<br/>+:The fourth & fifth detachments of Naraku. Both were slain soon after they were released.<br/>+;'''[[Muso]]'''<br/>+:The reincarnation of the soul of Onigumo that was expunged from Naraku's body.  He was absorbed back into Naraku.<br/>+;'''[[Kohaku]]''' (琥珀)<br/>+:Sango's younger brother who is under Naraku's control. Kohaku, Sango, and the whole yōkai-slaying tribe were shot by arrows due to the scheme of Naraku. Sango was the only one to survive.<br/>+<br/>+=== Wolf Tribe ===<br/>+*'''[[Koga (InuYasha)|Koga]] (鋼牙 ''Kōga'')''' — The young leader of a yōrōzoku (yōkai wolf tribe), Koga wishes to avenge his fallen comrades who were slaughtered by Kagura, one of Naraku's minions. While brash and arrogant, he is shrewd enough to run from a fight if he thinks he can't win. He has a shikon shard in each of his legs which make him stronger. Although he bickers with Inuyasha constantly, when one of them is in danger, the other will lend a hand.<br/>+;'''Ginta''' (銀太)<br/>+: Ginta is one of Koga's followers. His hair is gray with a dark blue piece in the center. He has mostly fur for his armor.<br/>+;'''Hakkaku''' (白角)<br/>+: Hakkaku is the other of Koga's followers. He has a white mohawk, chain armor, and a fur hide.<br/>+<br/>+===Characters from Modern Day===<br/>+;'''Kagome's family ('''[[Sota Higurashi]], [[Mama (InuYasha)|Kagome's Mom]], & [[Grandpa (InuYasha)|Kagome's Grandpa]]''' (日暮草太 ''Higurashi Sōta'', かごめの母, & かごめの祖父)<br/>+:They are the only ones aware of Kagome's double life and often cover for her while she's in Inuyasha's world.  Her mother takes Kagome's time travel adventures in stride and makes sure her daughter gets all the supplies she needs (first aid stuff, food); Sōta collects Kagome's homework from school and admires Inuyasha who he calls "Inu no nīchan" ("big brother" in the dub); Grandpa is a shrine keeper and comes up with all sorts of bizarre excuses as to why Kagome is not in school.<br/>+;'''[[Hojo (InuYasha)|Hojo]]''' (北条 ''Hōjō'')<br/>+:A boy in love with Kagome in the modern era, he is oblivious to the fact that Kagome doesn't seem to be in love with him. He often gives her unusual health-related gifts because of her many "sicknesses" from his family's health food store. Kagome later meets Hojo's ancestor, Hojo Akitoki, in Inuyasha's time; both descendant and ancestor are very alike in personality.  In real life, the [[Hojo clan]] were virtually annihilated during the [[Sengoku]] Era by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]].<br/>+;'''[[Yuka, Eri, Ayumi]]<br/>+: Kagome's three friends from modern day.  They are constantly trying to get Kagome to date Hojo and tries to solve the problems with her love life.

Jakotsu is quite openly homosexual, and many fans support a relationship between him and Bankotsu.<br/>+;'''Ginkotsu''' (銀骨)<br/>+:Listens to Renkotsu's orders, has robot metal parts on his body, and various amounts of weaponry within (sort of like a feudal era version of a cyborg). He often seems to say what sounds like "gesh" or "yes" from time to time. Later on he is made into somewhat of a mobile vehicle, particularly a tank, when a majority of his original body is destroyed.<br/>+;'''Suikotsu''' (睡骨)<br/>+:Uses metal claws as weapon, a man with a split personality: one is a nice, caring doctor, and one is an evil murderer; the evil side awoke when he was traumatized by seeing a child being killed in front of him; the only originally good person in the shichi'nintai, he is back to his good self at the moment of his "final" death (after resurrection).<br/>+;'''Kyokotsu''' (凶骨 ''Kyōkotsu'')<br/>+:A giant; large and stupid, his size is his weapon, and proves to be a  formidable foe. It is possible that he could be a [[jikininki]].<br/>+<br/>+=== Other Characters ===<br/>+;'''[[Midoriko]]''' (翠子)<br/>+:A priestess of great spiritual power from many centuries before the Sengoku period. Her soul was locked in battle with a yōkai's soul inside the Shikon Jewel, and the Jewel came out of her body.<br/>+;'''[[Tsubaki (Inu Yasha)|Tsubaki]]''' (椿)<br/>+:A dark priestess who made a deal with a demon to retain her youth and beauty. In her youth, she was Kikyo's rival and sees her chance at revenge when she encounters Kagome. She met her end when Naraku lured her to do his bidding with the almost complete Shikon Jewel and her underestimation of Kagome's abilities.<br/>+;'''[[Onigumo]]''' (鬼蜘蛛)<br/>+:The human bandit whose lust and greed was the catalyst for the creation of Naraku.  Taken from the legendary [[tsuchigumo]].<br/>+;'''[[Entei (Inuyasha)|Entei]]''' (炎蹄)<br/>+:A yōkai horse who serves only the most powerful yōkai.<br/>+;'''Kocho and Asuka'''<br/>+:Kikyo's shikigami that summoned Kagome when Kikyo needed to be purified of Naraku's shōki and act as messengers to Inuyasha when Kikyo wants to speak to him.

II ''), born '''Karol Józef Wojtyła''' {{ref|pronunciation}} ([[May 18]], [[1920]] – [[April 2]], [[2005]]) reigned as [[pope]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] for almost 27 years, from [[October 16]] [[1978]] until his death, making his the [[List of 10 longest-reigning popes|second-longest pontificate]]. On [[May 13]] [[2005]], [[Pope Benedict XVI]], John Paul II's successor, waived the five year waiting period for a cause for [[beatification]] to be opened. The official process for beatification began in the Diocese of [[Rome]] on [[June 28]], [[2005]]. [http://opportunities.typepad.com/news/2005/06/pope_john_paul_.html]  <br/>-He was the first [[Poland|Polish]] pope and the first non-[[Italian people|Italian]] pope since the 16th century. His early reign was marked by his opposition to [[Communism]], and he is often credited as one of the forces which brought about the fall of the [[Soviet Union]]. <br/>+{{germany-geo-stub}}<br/> <br/>-In other domains, his concern for the poor, the weak and those who suffer, and his stances on [[warfare]], [[violence]], [[capital punishment]], [[evolution]], world debt forgiveness, combined with his willingness to visit [[Socialist]] nations, and his strong relationships with leaders of non-Catholic Churches and non-Christian faiths ([[ecumenism]]) were considered by some to be proof that he was "liberal."  <br/>+[[Category:Towns in North Rhine-Westphalia]]<br/> <br/>-His affirmation of the long-standing Christian doctrine that [[abortion]], [[homosexual]] [[sexual relations|sex]], and [[contraception]] are immoral, his continuing the tradition of ordaining only men to the priesthood, teaching that divorced persons could not remarry without a declaration of nullity, that valid sacramental marriage exists between one man and one woman, emphasizing the benefits of retaining the discipline of mandatory [[Clerical celibacy|priestly celibacy]], and his opposition to [[secularism]] are cited by some as proof that he was "conservative."<br/>-<br/>-During his reign, the pope travelled extensively, visiting over 100 countries, more than any of his predecessors. He [[canonization|canonized]] more people than all popes before him put together. He was Pope during a period in which [[Catholicism]]'s influence declined in [[developed country|developed countries]] but expanded in the [[Third World]]. <br/>-<br/>-Pope John Paul II was extremely popular worldwide, attracting the largest crowds in history (at times attracting crowds of over one million people in a single venue [over four million people at the [[World Youth Day]] in Manila]), and being respected by many even outside of the [[Catholic Church]], despite strident criticism from some quarters.  John Paul II was fluent in numerous languages: his native [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Latin]].<br/>-<br/>-In 1992, he was diagnosed as having [[Parkinson's disease]]. On [[2 April]] [[2005]] at 9:37 pm [[Vatican City|Vatican]] Time, Pope John Paul II died while a vast crowd kept vigil on [[St Peter's Square]]. Millions of people flocked to Rome to pay their respects to the body and for his funeral. The last years of his reign had been marked by his fight against the various diseases ailing him, provoking some concerns that he should abdicate, but in retrospect his determination was widely seen as an exemplary display of courage.<br/>-<br/>-{{infobox popestyles|<br/>-papal name=Pope John Paul II|<br/>-dipstyle=[[His Holiness]]|<br/>-offstyle=Your Holiness|<br/>-relstyle=Holy Father|<br/>-deathstyle=[[Servant of God]]|}}<br/>-<br/>-==Overview==<br/>-<br/>-John Paul II emphasized what he called the "[[universal call to holiness]]" and attempted to define the Catholic Church's role in the modern world. He spoke out against ideologies and politics of [[communism]], [[Marxism]], [[feminism]], [[imperialism]], [[relativism]], [[materialism]], [[fascism]] (including [[Nazism]]), [[racism]] and unrestrained [[capitalism]]. In many ways, he fought against [[oppression]], [[secularism]] and [[poverty]]. Although he was on friendly terms with many [[Western world|Western]] heads of state and leading citizens, he reserved a special opprobrium for what he believed to be the corrosive spiritual effects of modern Western [[consumerism]] and the concomitant widespread secular and hedonistic orientation of Western populations.<br/>-<br/>-John Paul II affirmed traditional Catholic teachings by opposing [[abortion]], [[contraception]], [[capital punishment]], [[embryonic stem cell research]], [[human cloning]], [[euthanasia]], and [[war]]. He also defended traditional teachings on [[marriage]] and [[gender role]]s by opposing [[divorce]], [[same-sex marriage]] and the [[ordination of women]]. His conservative views were sometimes criticized as regressive. John Paul II called upon followers to vote according to Catholic teachings. <br/>-John Paul II became known as the "Pilgrim Pope" for travelling greater distances than had all his predecessors combined. According to John Paul II, the trips symbolized bridge-building efforts (in keeping with his title as [[Pontifex Maximus]], literally Master Bridge-Builder) between nations and religions, attempting to remove divisions created through history.<br/>-<br/>-He beatified 1,340 people, more people than any previous pope. The [[Roman Curia|Vatican]] asserts he canonized more people than the combined tally of his predecessors during the last five centuries, and from a far greater variety of cultures.[http://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/saints/index_saints_en.html] Whether he had canonized more saints than all previous popes put together, as is sometimes also claimed, is difficult to prove, as the records of many early canonizations are incomplete, missing, or inaccurate. However, it is known that his abolition of the office of ''Promotor Fidei'' ("Promoter of the Faith" and the origin of the term [[Devil's Advocate]]) streamlined the process. He has been criticized by many for doing this.<br/>-<br/>-Pope John Paul II died on [[2 April]] [[2005]] after a long fight against [[Parkinson's disease]] and other illnesses. Immediately after his death, many of his followers demanded that he be elevated to [[sainthood]] as soon as possible, shouting "Santo Subito" (meaning "Saint immediately" in [[Italian language|Italian]]). Both ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'' and [[Pope Benedict XVI]], Pope John Paul II's successor, referred to John Paul II as "Great".<br/>-<br/>-John Paul II was succeeded by the Dean of the [[College of Cardinals]], [[Pope Benedict XVI|Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger]] of [[Germany]], the former head of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] who had led the Funeral Mass for John Paul II.<br/>-<br/>-== Biography ==<br/>-{{main|Biography of Pope John Paul II}}<br/>-===Early life===<br/>-[[Image:Karol Wojtyla at 12.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Karol Wojtyła at 12 years old]]<br/>-Karol Józef Wojtyła was born on [[18 May]] [[1920]] in [[Wadowice]] in southern [[Poland]]. His mother, Emilia Kaczorowska, died in 1929, when he was just aged 9 and his father supported him so that he could study. His youth was marked by extensive contacts with the then thriving [[Jew]]ish community of [[Wadowice]]<br/>-<br/>-Karol enrolled at the [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Kraków]]. He worked as a volunteer librarian and did compulsory military training in the Academic Legion. In his youth he was an [[athletics|athlete]], [[acting|actor]] and [[playwright]] and he learned as many as eleven [[language]]s during his lifetime, including Latin, Ukrainian, Greek, Spanish, French, Italian, German, English, and of course his native Polish.  He also had some facility with Russian.<br/>-<br/>-During the [[Second World War]] academics of the Jagiellonian University were arrested and the university suppressed. All able-bodied males had to have a job. He variously worked as a messenger for a restaurant and a manual labourer in a limestone quarry.<br/>-<br/>-===Church career===<br/>-In 1942 he entered the [[Underground education in Poland during World War II|underground seminary]] run by the Archbishop of [[Kraków]], [[Adam Stefan Cardinal Sapieha|Cardinal Sapieha]]. Karol Wojtyła was [[ordination|ordained]] a [[priest]] on [[1 November]] [[1946]].  Not long after, he was sent to study [[theology]] at the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas]], commonly known as the [[Angelicum]], where he earned a [[licentiate]] and later a [[doctorate]] in sacred theology. This doctorate, the first of two, was based on the Latin dissertation ''Doctrina de fide apud S. Ioannem a Cruce'' (''The Doctrine of Faith According to Saint John of the Cross'').  Even though his doctoral work was unanimously approved in June of 1948, he was denied the degree   because he could not afford to print the text of his dissertation (an Angelicum rule).  In December of that year, a revised text of his dissertation was approved by the theological faculty of [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Kraków]], and Wojtyła was finally awarded the degree. <br/>-<br/>-He earned a second doctorate, based on an evaluation of the possibility of founding a Catholic ethic on the ethical system of [[phenomenologist]] [[Max Scheler]] (''An Evaluation of the Possibility of Constructing a Christian Ethics on the Basis of the System of Max Scheler''), in 1954.  As was the case with the first degree, he was not granted the degree upon earning it.  This time, the faculty at Jagiellonian University was forbidden by communist authorities from granting the degree.  In conjunction with his [[habilitation]] at [[Catholic University of Lublin]], [[Poland]], he finally obtained the [[doctorate]] in [[philosophy]] in 1957 from that institution, where he had assumed the Chair of Ethics in 1956. <br/>-<br/>-On [[4 July]] [[1958]] [[Pope Pius XII]] named him titular bishop of [[Ombi]] and auxiliary to Archbishop Baziak, apostolic administrator of the [[Archdiocese]] of [[Kraków]]. Karol Wojtyła found himself at 38 the youngest [[bishop]] in [[Poland]].<br/>-<br/>-In 1962 Bishop Wojtyła took part in the [[Second Vatican Council]], and in December 1963 [[Pope Paul VI]] appointed him [[Archbishop]] of [[Kraków]]. Paul VI elevated him to [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] in 1967.<br/>-[[Image:John Paul.jpg|thumb|right|John Paul Blessing the Faithful]]<br/>-<br/>-===A Pope from Poland===<br/>-{{main|Papal conclave, 1978 (October)}}<br/>-In August 1978 following Paul's death, he voted in the [[Papal election|Papal Conclave]] that elected [[Pope John Paul I]], who at 65 was considered young by papal standards. However John Paul I was in poor health and he died after only 33 days as pope, thereby precipitating another conclave.<br/>-<br/>-Voting in the second conclave was divided between two particularly strong candidates: [[Giuseppe Cardinal Siri]], the Archbishop of [[Genoa]]; and [[Giovanni Cardinal Benelli]], the Archbishop of [[Florence]] and a close associate of [[Pope John Paul I]]. In early ballots, Benelli came within nine votes of victory. However Wojtyła secured election as a compromise candidate, in part through the support of [[Franz Cardinal König]] and others who had previously supported Cardinal Siri.<br/>-<br/>-He became the 264th Pope according to the Vatican (265th according to sources that count [[Pope Stephen II]]). At only 58 years of age, he was the youngest pope elected since [[Pope Pius IX]] in [[1846]]. Like his immediate predecessor, Pope John Paul II dispensed with the traditional [[Papal coronation]] and instead received ecclesiastical [[investiture]] with the simplified [[Papal inauguration]].<br/>-<br/>-=== Assassination attempts ===<br/>-<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:JPIIassinattem81.jpeg|thumb|215px|Bodyguards rush to John Paul II's aid after the first assassination attempt in 1981.]] --><br/>-On [[13 May]] [[1981]] John Paul II was shot and critically wounded by [[Mehmet Ali Ağca]], a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] gunman, as he entered [[Saint Peter's Square|St. Peter's Square]] to address an audience. Ağca was caught and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]]. Two days after [[Christmas]] 1983, John Paul II visited the prison where his would-be assassin was being held. The two spoke privately for some time. John Paul II said, "What we talked about will have to remain a secret between him and me. I spoke to him as a brother whom I have pardoned and who has my complete trust."  Ağca was released on [[parole]] from a Turkish prison in January, 2006.<br/>-<br/>-Another assassination attempt took place on [[12 May]] [[1982]], just a day before the anniversary of the last attempt on his life, in [[Fatima, Portugal]] when a man tried to stab John Paul II with a [[bayonet]], but was stopped by security guards. The assailant, an ultraconservative Spanish [[priest]] named [[Juan María Fernández y Krohn]], reportedly opposed the reforms of the [[Second Vatican Council]] and called the pope an agent of [[Moscow]]. He served a six-year sentence, and was expelled from Portugal afterwards.<br/>-<br/>-=== Health ===<br/>-{{main|Health of Pope John Paul II}}<br/>-When he first entered the [[papacy]] in 1978, John Paul II was an avid sportsman, enjoying [[hiking]] and [[swimming]]. In addition, John Paul II travelled extensively after becoming pope; at the time, the 58-year old was extremely healthy and active.<br/>-<br/>-In 1981, though, John Paul II's health suffered a major blow after the first failed [[assassination]] attempt. The bullet-wound caused severe [[bleeding]], and the Pope's [[blood pressure]] dropped. In addition, a [[colostomy]] was also performed. He nevertheless maintained an impressive physical condition throughout the 1980s.<br/>-<br/>-Starting about 1992, John Paul II's health slowly declined. He began to suffer from an increasingly slurred speech and difficulty in hearing. In addition, the Pope rarely walked in public. Though not officially confirmed by the [[Roman Curia|Vatican]] until 2003, most experts agreed that the frail pontiff suffered from [[Parkinson's Disease]].<br/>-<br/>-In February 2005 John Paul II was taken to the hospital with an inflammation of the [[larynx]], the result of [[influenza]]. Though later released from the hospital, he was taken back later that month after difficulty breathing. A [[tracheotomy]] was performed, limiting the pope's speaking abilities.<br/>-<br/>-In March of 2005, speculation was high that the Pope was near-death; this was confirmed by the Vatican days before John Paul II passed away.<br/>-<br/>-=== Death ===<br/>-On [[31 March]] [[2005]] the Pope developed a very high fever, but was neither rushed to the hospital, nor offered life support, apparently, in accordance with his wishes to die in the Vatican.{{ref|Frail}} Later that day Vatican sources announced that John Paul II had been given the [[Anointing of the Sick]] by his friend and secretary [[Archbishop]] [[Stanisław Dziwisz]]. During the final days of the Pope's life, the lights were kept burning through the night where he lay in the Papal apartment on the top floor of the [[Apostolic Palace]].<br/>-<br/>-Thousands of people rushed to the Vatican, filling [[St Peter's Square]] and beyond, and held vigil for two days. At about 15:30 CEST, John Paul II spoke his final words, "Let me go to the house of the Father", to his aides in his native Polish and fell into a [[coma]] about four hours later.{{ref|Final}}  He died in his private apartments, at 21:37 [[CEST]] (19:37 [[UTC]]) on [[2 April]], 46 days short of his 85th birthday.  Already, the vigil of the Second Sunday of Easter, that is, Divine Mercy Sunday, was being commemorated.<br/>-<br/>-A crowd of over two million within Vatican City, over one billion Catholics world-wide, and many non-Catholics mourned John Paul II. The [[Poles]] were particularly devastated by his death.  The public viewing of his body in [[St. Peter's Basilica]] drew over four million people to Vatican City and was one of the largest [[pilgrimage]]s in the [[history of Christianity]]. Many world leaders expressed their condolences and ordered flags in their countries lowered to half-mast. Numerous countries with a Catholic majority, and even some with only a small Catholic population, declared mourning for John Paul II.<br/>-<br/>-==== Funeral ====<br/>-<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:jp2crowdstoseepope.jpg|thumb|300px|right|<small>©[[Associated Press]]</small><br>Two million people reportedly viewed Pope John Paul II's body lying in state.]] --><br/>-{{main|Funeral of Pope John Paul II}}<br/>-The death of Pope John Paul II set into motion [[ritual]]s and traditions dating back to [[medieval]] times. The [[Rite of Visitation]] took place from [[4 April]] through 22:00 CET (20:00 [[UTC]]) on [[7 April]] at [[St. Peter's Basilica]]. On [[8 April]] the Mass of [[Requiem]] was conducted by the Dean of the College of Cardinals, [[Pope Benedict XVI|Joseph Ratzinger]], who would later become the next pope.  It has been estimated to have been the largest attended funeral of all time.<br/>-<br/>-John Paul II was interred in the grottoes under the basilica, the Tomb of the Popes. He was lowered into the tomb that had been occupied by the remains of [[Pope John XXIII|Blessed Pope John XXIII]], but which had been empty since his remains had been moved into the main body of the basilica after his [[beatification]] by John Paul II in 2003.<br/>-<br/>-==== John Paul "The Great" ====<br/>-Since the death of John Paul II, a number of clergy at the Vatican have been referring to the late pontiff as "John Paul the Great"&mdash;only the fourth pope to be so acclaimed, and the first since the first millennium. His successor, [[Pope Benedict XVI]], referred to him as "the great Pope John Paul II" in his first address from the [[loggia]] of St Peter's Church.  Pope Benedict has continued to refer to John Paul II as "the Great."  At the 2005 World Youth Day in Germany, Pope Benedict, speaking in Polish, John Paul's native language, said, "As the great Pope John Paul II would say: keep the flame of faith alive in your lives and your people." The Italian newspaper ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' even called him "the Greatest."<br/>-<br/>-Scholars of [[canon law]] say that there is no official process for declaring a pope "Great"; the title establishes itself through popular, and continued, usage.  The three popes who today commonly are known as "Great" are [[Pope Leo I|Leo I]], who reigned from [[440]]&ndash;[[461]] and persuaded [[Attila the Hun]] to withdraw from Rome; [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory I]], [[590]]&ndash;[[604]], after whom the [[Gregorian Chant]] is named; and [[Pope Nicholas I|Nicholas I]], [[858]]&ndash;[[867]], who also withstood a siege of Rome (in this case from [[Carolingian]] Christians, over a dispute regarding marriage [[annulment]]).<br/>-<br/>-Historically, the title "the Great" has been given only to the first pope (or sovereign) in a line bearing a name.  John Paul II would, by this criterion, be unlikely to be dubbed "the Great."  However, there are exceptions. For example, Alexander the Great, was also Alexander III.  The fact that, until John Paul II, no popes after the first, have received this title is likely more a function of the fact that so few popes have been acclaimed "the Great" at all, and as such this is not a title that is limited to only the first pope of a given name.<br/>-<br/>-====Beatification====<br/>-On [[13 May]] [[2005]] [[Pope Benedict XVI|Benedict XVI]] made his first [[promulgation]] of the [[beatification]] process choosing to honour his predecessor, John Paul II.  Normally five years pass before the beatification process begins for a person after his or her death but due to the popularity of John Paul II&mdash;devotees chanted "Santo subito!" ("Saint now!") during the late pontiff's funeral&mdash;Benedict XVI waived the custom and officially styled the late pope with the title given to all those being scrutinized in the beatification process, Servant of God.<br/>-<br/>-==Life's work==<br/>-<br/>-===Teachings===<br/>-<br/>-:Main article: ''[[Teachings of Pope John Paul II]]''<br/>-<br/>-As pope, John Paul II's most important role was to teach people about [[Catholic]] [[Christianity]]. He wrote a number of important documents that many observers believe will have long-lasting influence on the Church.<br/>-<br/>-A notable achievement of John Paul II was the publication of the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]], which became an international bestseller. Its purpose, according to the Pope's [[Apostolic Constitution]] ''Fidei Depositum'' was to be "a statement of the Church's faith and of Catholic doctrine, attested to or illumined by Sacred Scripture, the Apostolic Tradition and the Church's [[Magisterium]]." His first [[encyclical]] letters focused on the [[Triune God]]; the very first was on [[Jesus]] the Redeemer (''"[[Redemptor Hominis]]"'').<br/>-<br/>-In his Apostolic Letter ''At the beginning of the third millennium'' (''[[Novo Millennio Ineunte]]''), he emphasized the importance of "starting afresh from [[Christ]]": "No, we shall not be saved by a formula but by a Person." In what he calls a "program for all times," he  placed "sanctity" as the single most important priority of all pastoral activities in the entire Catholic Church. Thus, he canonized many saints around the world as exemplars for his vision and he supported the prelature of [[Opus Dei]], whose aim is to spread the message of the [[universal call to holiness]] and the sanctification of secular activities, which he said is a "great ideal." <br/>-<br/>-In ''The Splendour of the Truth'' (''[[Veritatis Splendor]]'') he emphasized the dependence of man on God and his law ("Without the Creator, the creature disappears") and the "dependence of freedom on the truth". He warned that man "giving himself over to [[relativism]] and [[skepticism]], goes off in search of an illusory freedom apart from truth itself".<br/>-<br/>-In ''[[Fides et Ratio]]'' (''On the Relationship between Faith and Reason'') John Paul promotes a renewed interest in philosophy and an autonomous pursuit for Truth in theological matters. Drawing on many different sources (such as Thomism), he describes the mutually supporting relationship between faith and reason, and emphasizes why it is important that theologians should focus on the relationship. John Paul proposes that philosophy has lost its meaning (eg. the pursuit for objective truth), and that restoring it will ultimately help cure the nihilistic condition of our current age; and, moreover, lead to the Truth of sacred scripture.<br/>-<br/>-John Paul II also wrote extensively about workers and the social doctrine of the Church, which he discussed in three encyclicals. Through his encyclicals, John Paul also talked about the dignity of women and the importance of the [[family]] for the future of mankind.<br/>-<br/>-Other important documents include ''The Gospel of Life'' (''[[Evangelium Vitae]]''), where he issued unprecedented teachings on moral matters like on murder, euthanasia and abortion, statements which, according to the [[ Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], were "infallible", and ''Orientale Lumen'' (''Light of the East'').<br/>-<br/>-John Paul II, who was present and very influential at the [[Second Vatican Council| Vatican II]] (1962-65), affirmed the teachings of that Council and did much to implement them.  Nevertheless, his critics often wished aloud that he would embrace the so-called "progressive" agenda that some hoped would evolve as a result of the Council.  John Paul II continued to declare that [[contraception]], [[abortion]], and [[homosexual|homosexual acts]] were gravely sinful, and, with [[Ratzinger|Cardinal Ratzinger]] (future Pope Benedict XVI), opposed [[Liberation theology]]. He exalted marital [[sexual intercourse]] as a [[sacrament]]al act that was, in every instance, profaned by contraception, abortion, divorce followed by a second marriage, and homosexual acts.  He also rejected calls to break with the constant tradition of the Church by ordaining women to the priesthood. In addition, John Paul II chose not to end the discipline of mandatory priestly [[celibacy]], although he did encourage married clergymen of other Christian traditions who later became Catholic to be ordained as Catholic priests. In fact, the Council did not advocate "progressive" changes in these areas, and condemned abortion as an "unspeakable crime".<br/>-<br/>-John Paul II, as a writer of [[philosophical]] and [[theology|theological]] thought, was characterized by his explorations in [[phenomenology]] and [[personalism]]. He is also known for his development of the [[theology of the body]].<br/>-<br/>-=== Pastoral trips ===<br/>-{{main|Pastoral trips of Pope John Paul II}}<br/>-[[Image:Foreign trips of John Paul II.png|thumb|250px|Map indicating countries which were visited by John Paul II.]]<br/>-During his pontificate, Pope John Paul II made 104 foreign trips, more than all previous popes put together. In total he logged more than 1.1 million km (725,000 miles). He consistently attracted large crowds on his travels, some amongst the largest ever assembled in human history. While some of his trips (such as to the [[United States]] and the [[Holy Land]]) were to places previously visited by [[Pope Paul VI]] (the first pope to travel widely), many others were to places that no pope had ever visited before. All these travels were paid by the money of the countries he visited and not by the Vatican.<br/>-<br/>-[[Image:Pope-poland.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Millions cheer Pope John Paul II during his first visit to Poland as pontiff in 1979]]<br/>-One of John Paul II's earliest official visits was to [[Poland]], in June 1979.{{ref|home}} In 1982 he became the first reigning pope to travel to the [[United Kingdom]], where he met [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]], the [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England|Supreme Governor]] of the [[Church of England]].<br/>-<br/>-Throughout his trips, he stressed his devotion to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] through visits to various [[shrines to the Virgin Mary]], notably [[Knock]] in [[Ireland]], [[Fátima, Portugal|Fátima]] in [[Portugal]], [[Our Lady of Guadalupe|Guadalupe]] in [[Mexico]] and [[Lourdes]] in [[France]].<br/>-<br/>-In 1984 John Paul II became the first Pope to visit [[South Korea|Korea]] and [[Puerto Rico]]. On [[15 January]] [[1995]] he offered Mass to an estimated crowd of between four and eight million in [[Luneta Park]], [[Manila, Philippines]], the largest ever papal crowd, and considered the largest single event in human history. On [[January 20]], [[1998]], Pope John Paul II became the first pontiff to visit [[Cuba]].  During his visit, John Paul sharply criticized Cuba's stance on religious expression.  On [[22 March]] [[1998]] he paid a second visit to [[Nigeria]]. Also in 1999 John Paul II made another of his multiple trips to the United States. In 2000 he became the first modern Catholic pope to visit [[Egypt]], where he met with the [[Coptic Christianity|Coptic pope]] and the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Alexandria]]. In May 2001 the Pontiff took a pilgrimage that would trace the steps of his co-namesake, [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]], across the [[Mediterranean]], from [[Greece]] to [[Syria]] to [[Malta]].<br/>-<br/>-He was the first Catholic Pope to visit and pray in an [[Islamic]] [[mosque]], in [[Damascus]], [[Syria]]. He visited [[Umayyad Mosque]], where [[John the Baptist]] is believed to be interred.<br/>-<br/>-In September 2001 amid post-[[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11]] concerns, he travelled to [[Kazakhstan]], with an audience of largely [[Muslim]]s, as well as [[Armenia]], to participate in the celebration of the 1700 years of [[Christianity]] in that nation.<br/>-<br/>-=== Relations with other religions ===<br/>-Pope John Paul II travelled extensively and came into contact with many divergent faiths. With these he ceaselessly attempted to find common ground, whether it be doctrinal or dogmatic. He made history with his establishment of contacts with [[Israel]], praying at the [[Western Wall]] in Jerusalem. [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|Tenzin Gyatso]], the 14th [[Dalai Lama]] and the spiritual leader of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], visited Pope John Paul II eight times, more than any other single dignitary. The Pope and the Dalai Lama often shared similar views and understood similar plights, both coming from peoples who have suffered under [[communism]].<br/>-<br/>-<gallery><br/>-Image:Dalai Lama.jpg|John Paul II meets [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama]] at the Vatican in 1999.<br/>-Image:Jp2lutheran_2.jpg|Pope John Paul II becomes the first pope ever to preach in a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church; Rome, December 1983<br/>-Image:jp ii wailing_wall.jpg|John Paul II prays and expresses sorrow for past Catholic mistreatment of Jews at the [[Western Wall]].<br/>-Image:Jp2synogogue.jpg|Pope John Paul II visiting The Great Synagogue of Rome in April 1986<br/>-Image:Pope_and_Christodoulos2.jpg|Pope John Paul II and Archbishop Christodoulos issue a "common declaration".<br/>-</gallery><br/>-<br/>-==== Relations with the Jewish people ====<br/>-[[Relations between Catholicism and Judaism]] improved during the pontificate of John Paul II. He spoke frequently about the Church's relationship with [[Jew]]s. As a child, Karol Wojtyla had played sports with his many Jewish neighbors. In 1979 he became the first Pope to visit [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] in [[Poland]], where many of his countrymen (mostly Polish Jews) had perished under [[Nazi]] rule. Shortly afterwards, he became the first pope known to have made an official papal visit to a synagogue, when he visited the [[Synagogue of Rome]] on [[13 April]] [[1986]].<br/>-<br/>-In March 2000, John Paul II visited [[Yad Vashem]], (the Israeli national [[the Holocaust|Holocaust]] memorial) in [[Israel]] and later touched the holiest site in [[Judaism]], the [[Western Wall]] in [[Jerusalem]]. In October 2003 the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) issued a statement congratulating John Paul II on entering the 25th year of his papacy.<br/>-<br/>-Immediately after the pope's death, the ADL issued a statement that Pope John Paul II had revolutionized Catholic-Jewish relations, saying that &quot;more change for the better took place in his 27 year Papacy than in the nearly 2,000 years before.&quot; (''Pope John Paul II: An Appreciation: A Visionary Remembered'').<br/>-<br/>-A number of points of dispute still exist between the Catholic Church and the Jewish community, including [[World War II]]-related issues and issues of doctrine. Nonetheless, the number of issues that divide Jewish groups and the Vatican has dropped significantly during the last 40 years.<br/>-<br/>-==== Relations with the Eastern Orthodox Church ====<br/>-{{main|Pope John Paul II's relations with the Eastern Orthodox Church}}<br/>-In May 1999, John Paul II visited [[Romania]] on the invitation from Patriarch [[Teoctist]] of the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]]. This was the first time a pope had visited a predominantly Eastern Orthodox country since the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]] in 1054. On his arrival, the Patriarch and the President of Romania, [[Emil Constantinescu]], greeted the Pope. The Patriarch stated, "The second millennium of Christian history began with a painful wounding of the unity of the Church; the end of this millennium has seen a real commitment to restoring Christian unity."<br/>-<br/>-John Paul II visited other heavily Orthodox areas such as [[Ukraine]], despite lack of welcome at times, and he said that an end to the Schism was one of his fondest wishes.<br/>-<br/>-Pope John Paul II could not escape the controversy of the [[involvement of Croatian Catholic clergy with the Ustasa regime]] of an active collaborator with the [[Ustase|Ustaše]] fascist regime. On [[22 June]] [[2003]] he visited [[Banja Luka]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].<br/>-<br/>-The Pope had been also saying during his entire pontificate that one of his greatest dreams was to visit [[Russia]], but this never occurred. He had made several attempts to solve the problems which arose over a period of centuries between the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] churches, like giving back the [[Kazan]] [[Icon|Icon of the Mother of God]] in August 2004. However, the Orthodox Church never expressed much enthusiasm, making statements to the effect of: "The question of the visit of the Pope in Russia is not connected by the journalists with the problems between the Churches, which are now unreal to solve, but with giving back one of many sacred things, which were illegally stolen from Russia." ([[Vsevolod Chaplin]]).<br/>-<br/>-===The Pope for youth===<br/>-<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Toronto.jpg|frame|left|120px|Pope John Paul II met a quarter of a million young people in [[Toronto]] in 2002]] --><br/>-John Paul II had a special relationship also with Catholic youth and is known by some as The Pope for Youth. He was a hero to many of them. Indeed, at gatherings, young Catholics, and conceivably non-Catholics, were often fond of chanting the phrase "JP Two, We Love You", and occasionally John Paul would retort "No. JP Two, He Loves YOU!"<br/>-<br/>-He established [[World Youth Day]] in 1984 with the intention of bringing young Catholics from all parts of the world together to celebrate their faith. These week-long meetings of youth occur every two or three years, attracting hundreds of thousands of young people, who go there to sing, party, have a good time and deepen their faith. His most faithful youths gathered themselves in two organizations: "papaboys" and "papagirls."<br/>-<br/>-===Apologies===<br/>-Over the later parts of his reign, John Paul II made several apologies to various peoples that had been wronged by the Catholic Church through the years. Even before he became the Pope, he was a prominent supporters of initiatives like the [[Letter of Reconciliation of the Polish Bishops to the German Bishops]] from 1965. During his reign as a Pope, he publicly made apologies for over 100 of these mistakes, including:<br/>-*The persecution of the Italian scientist and philosopher [[Galileo Galilei]] in the [[trial (law)|trial]] by the Roman Catholic Church in 1633 ([[31 October]] [[1992]]).<br/>-*Catholic involvement with the [[African slave trade]] ([[9 August]] [[1993]]).<br/>-*The Church's role in [[Execution by burning|burnings at the stake]] and the religious wars that followed the [[Protestant Reformation]] (May 1995, in the [[Czech Republic]]).<br/>-*The injustices committed against women in the name of Christ, the violation of women's rights and for the historical denigration of women ([[10 July]] [[1995]], in a letter to "every woman").<br/>-*Inactivity and silence of some Roman Catholics during the [[Holocaust]] ([[16 March]] [[1998]]).<br/>-*For the execution of [[Jan Hus]] in 1415 ([[18 December]] [[1999]] in [[Prague]]). When John Paul II visited Prague in 1990s, he requested experts in this matter "to define with greater clarity the position held by Jan Hus among the Church's reformers, and acknowledged that "independently of the theological convictions he defended, Hus cannot be denied integrity in his personal life and commitment to the nation's moral education." It was another step in building a bridge between Catholics and Protestants.<br/>-*For the sins of Catholics throughout the ages for violating "the rights of ethnic groups and peoples, and [for showing] contempt for their cultures and religious traditions". ([[12 March]] [[2000]], during a public Mass of Pardons).<br/>-*For the sins of the [[Fourth Crusade|Crusader attack on Constantinople]] in 1204. ([[4 May]] [[2001]], to the [[Patriarch of Constantinople]]).<br/>-*For [[missionary]] abuses in the past against indigenous peoples of the [[Oceania|South Pacific]] ([[22 November]] [[2001]], via the [[Internet]]).<br/>-*For the massacre of [[Aztecs]] and other [[Mesoamerica]]ns by the [[Spain|Spanish]] in the name of the Church.<br/>-<br/>-=== Social and political stances ===<br/>-John Paul II was a considered a conservative on [[doctrine]] and issues relating to reproduction and the [[ordination]] of women.  No pope, however, has strayed from the Catholic Church's unbroken moral teachings on artificial contraception and the ordination of women.<br/>-<br/>-A series of 129 lectures given by John Paul during his Wednesday audiences in Rome between September 1979 and November 1984 were later compiled and published as a single work entitled "[[Theology of the Body]]," an extended meditation on the nature of [[human sexuality]] and masculinity in human life. He also extended it to condemnation of abortion, [[euthanasia]] and virtually all uses of capital punishment, calling them all a part of the "[[culture of death]]" that is pervasive in the modern world. He was opposed to [[capital punishment]]. He campaigned for world [[Debt_relief|debt forgiveness]] and [[social justice]].<br/>-<br/>-==== Stance against dictatorship ====<br/>-<br/>-In 1984 and 1986, through the voice of [[Ratzinger|Cardinal Ratzinger]], leader of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], John Paul II officially condemned the [[Liberation theology]] which had many followers in South America. [[Oscar Romero]]'s attempt, during his visit to Europe, to obtain a Vatican condemnation of [[El Salvador]]'s regime, denounced for violations of human rights and its support of [[death squads]], was a failure. In his travel in Managua, Nicaragua, John Paul II harshly condemned what he dubbed the "popular Church" (i.e. "[[ecclesial base communities]]" (CEBs) supported by the [[Latin American Episcopal Conference|CELAM]]) and, against Nicaraguan clergy tendencies to support the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinistas]], insisted on Vatican's sole and only authority. John Paul II was also criticized for visiting [[Augusto Pinochet]] in Chile. He invited him to restore democracy, but, critics claim, not in as firm terms as the ones he used against communist countries. John Paul also allegedly endorsed [[Pío Cardinal Laghi]], who critics say supported the "[[Dirty War]]" in Argentina and was on friendly terms with the Argentinean generals of the military dictatorship, allegedly playing regularly tennis matches with general [[Jorge Rafael Videla]]. <br/>-<br/>-<br/>-[[Image:1981 01 Lech Walesa.jpg|250px|left|thumb|[[Lech Wałęsa]], leader of [[Solidarność]], received by Pope John Paul II in the Vatican in January 1981]]<br/>-The pope, who began his papacy when the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] controlled his native country of Poland, as well as the rest of [[Eastern Europe]], was a harsh critic of [[communism]], supporting the Polish [[Solidarity]] movement. Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] once said the collapse of the [[Iron Curtain]] would have been impossible without John Paul II.{{ref|Gorbachev}} This view is shared by those people who credited him, as well as [[Ronald Reagan]], of the 1989 fall of [[Berlin Wall]]. In later years, after having harshly condemned [[Liberation theology]], John Paul II criticized some of the more extreme versions of [[corporate capitalism]].<br/>-<br/>-==== Jubilee 2000 campaign ====<br/>-<br/>-In 2000 he publicly endorsed the [[Jubilee 2000]] campaign on [[African]] [[debt relief]] fronted by Irish rock stars [[Bob Geldof]] and [[Bono]]. It was reported that during this period, [[U2]]'s recording sessions were repeatedly interrupted by phone calls from the pope, wanting to discuss the campaign with Bono.<br/>-<br/>-==== Iraq war ====<br/>-<br/>-In 2003 John Paul II also became a prominent critic of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|2003 US-led invasion of Iraq]]. He sent former [[Nunciature to the United States|Apostolic Pro-Nuncio to the United States]] [[Pío Cardinal Laghi]] to talk with [[President of the United States|American President]] [[George W. Bush]] to express opposition to the war. John Paul II said that it was up to the [[United Nations]] to solve the international conflict through diplomacy and that a unilateral aggression is a crime against peace and a violation of [[international law]].<br/>-<br/>-==== European Constitutional Treaty ====<br/>-<br/>-In [[European Union]] negotiations for a new [[European Constitution|European Constitutional Treaty]] in 2003 and 2004, the Vatican's representatives failed to secure any mention of Europe's "Christian heritage"&mdash;one of the pope's cherished goals.<br/>-<br/>-==== Sex issues ====<br/>-<br/>-The pope was also a leading critic of [[homosexual marriage]]. In his last book, ''Memory and Identity'', he referred to the "pressures" on the [[European Parliament]] to permit homosexual marriage. Reuters quotes the pope as writing, "It is legitimate and necessary to ask oneself if this is not perhaps part of a new ideology of evil, perhaps more insidious and hidden, which attempts to pit human rights against the family and against man."<br/>-<br/>-The Pope also reaffirmed the Church's teaching on gender in relation to [[transsexuals]], as the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], which he supervised, made clear that the condition must be seen as a mental illness and that transsexuals could not serve in church positions.<br/>-<br/>-===Criticism===<br/>-[[Image:John Paul II Brazil 1997 3.jpg|thumb|200px|John Paul II visited Brazil in 1997.]] <br/>-{{main|Criticism of Pope John Paul II}}<br/>-<br/>-When the [[Cold War]] ended, some conservatives argued that the Pope moved too far left on foreign policy, and had [[pacifism|pacifist]] views that were too extreme. His opposition to the [[2003 Iraq War]] was criticized for this reason.<br/>-<br/>-John Paul II was also criticized for his support of the [[Opus Dei]] prelature and the [[canonization]] of its founder, [[Josemaría Escrivá|Jose María Escrivá]], whose opponents call him an admirer of [[Spain|Spanish]] dictator [[Francisco Franco]]. This support was coherent with the 1984 and 1986 condemnations of [[Liberation theology]], the Pope's opposition to [[Oscar Romero]] in El Salvador and, according to his critics, also to his visit to [[Augusto Pinochet]], Chile's dictator. His supporters say that the latter is one more among all the heads of states he visited. <br/>-<br/>-John Paul II's steadfast defense of the moral teachings of the Catholic Church regarding [[gender roles]] and [[human sexuality|sexuality]] also came under attack. Some [[feminism|feminists]] criticized his positions on the role of women, while other feminist groups championed his support and deep understanding of the dignity of women.  He upheld the Catholic stand against [[homosexuality]] and [[same-sex marriage]] because he believed that although every homosexual person should be respected and loved, the sexual expression of homosexuality is a sin. This upset many Gay-rights activists.<br/>-<br/>-His unwaivering stand with Catholic moral teachings on artificial [[contraception]] was particularly controversial. Claims were made that John Paul II's papacy spread an unproven belief that [[condom]]s do not block the spread of [[HIV]]; between these two claims, many critics have blamed him for contributing to [[AIDS in Africa|AIDS epidemic]]s in [[Africa]] and elsewhere in which millions have died.{{ref|Toynbee}} His supporters disagree and stress the importance of sexual abstinence in preventing the spread of [[AIDS]]. Critics have also claimed that large families are caused by lack of contraception and exacerbate [[Third World]] poverty and problems such as [[street children]] in [[South America]].  Supporters have countered that poverty can not be contracepted out of existance.<br/>-<br/>-John Paul II was also criticized for the way he administered the Church; in particular, some critics charged that he failed to respond quickly enough to the [[Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal]]. He was also criticized for [[Centralization|recentralizing]] power back to the Vatican following what some viewed as a [[decentralization]] by [[Pope John XXIII]]. As such he was regarded by some as a strict [[authoritarian]].<br/>-<br/>-Besides all the criticism from those demanding modernization, [[Traditional Catholic]]s were at times equally vehement in denouncing him from the right, demanding a return to the [[Tridentine Mass]] and repudiation of the reforms instituted after the [[Second Vatican Council]], such as the use of the vernacular language in Mass.

In the Insular (i.e. Island-related) Cases, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] established the framework for applying the Constitution to these islands. In summary, the Supreme Court said that full constitutional rights did not automatically extend to all areas under American control.<br/> <br/>-==Career==<br/>+==List of Insular Cases==<br/>+There is no authoritative list of Insular Cases; the term at a minimum applies to several 1901 cases but certain later decisions are sometimes also included:<br/> <br/>-===Global Wrestling Federation===<br/>-Booker Huffman or Booker T '''(Edmons Morka)''' was trained by [[Scott Casey]] and debuted on [[March 1]], [[1989]] as '''Booker T'''.

They debuted as the tag team [[Harlem Heat]], with Booker renamed "'''Kole'''" and Lane renamed "Kane". At their request Kole and Kane were once again named "'''Booker T'''" and "Stevie Ray" respectively.  and would hold the [[WCW World Tag Team Championship|WCW World Tag Team Championships]] a record ten times.<br/>+==See also==<br/>+*[[Insular area]]s, [[Guano Islands Act]]<br/> <br/>-In the late [[1990s]], Huffman began competing as a singles wrestler, while his brother joined the [[nWo]], then became a [[color commentator]]. Huffman won the [[WCW World Television Championship]] six times, and traded the belt with [[Chris Benoit]] in a "best of seven" series which saw the belt contested on ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Nitro]]'', ''[[WCW Thunder|Thunder]]'' and [[List of WCW pay-per-view events|pay-per-views]]. He was the first ever [[African American]] to hold the title. <br/>+==External link and primary source==<br/>+<!-- source for list of cases --><br/>+*[http://www.macmeekin.com/Library/Insular%20Cases.htm A lawyer's website on Island Law]<br/> <br/>-During 2000, Stevie Ray reformed Harlem Heat with [[Anthony Norris|Big T]], and had [[lawyer]] [[Clarence Mason|J. Biggs]] strip Huffman of his right to use the letter "T" as part of his name. Throughout this period, Huffman was referred to simply as "'''Booker'''". Huffman would eventually completely change his in-ring name, joining [[Bill DeMott|General Rection's]] [[military]]-themed [[Misfits In Action]] [[stable (professional wrestling)|faction]] as '''G.I. Bro'''. He regained his more popular alias shortly before his World Title win.<br/>-<br/>-Huffman was elevated to the main event in [[1999]]; Lane Huffman has speculated that this could in part have been due to a number of [[Racism|racial discrimination]] [[lawsuit]]s filed against WCW. After WCW [[booker (professional wrestling)|booker]] [[Vince Russo]] grew disgruntled with [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship|WCW World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Hulk Hogan]]'s alleged politicking, he fired Hogan during the live broadcast of [[Bash at the Beach#2000|Bash at the Beach 2000]] and announced an impromptu match between [[Jeff Jarrett]] and Huffman for the now-vacant World Title. Huffman won the match, in the process becoming the second ever African American Champion. He went on to win the title three more times in 2000 and [[2001]], and would win the title once more in the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (where he lost the belt to the [[The Rock (entertainer)|The Rock]].  Coincidentally, the similarity in gimmicks between the two wrestlers has called into question who was the originator of said [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]]).<br/>-<br/>-Huffman won a total of twenty three titles in WCW, making him the most decorated athlete in the history of the organization.<br/>-<br/>-===World Wrestling Entertainment===<br/>-After WCW was bought by the WWF in [[March 2001]], Booker T(aka Edoms Morka) originally appeared as a face. However, he turned heel during [[The Invasion]] storyline as a senior member of [[The Alliance]]. After the Alliance disbanded following the [[Survivor Series#2001|2001 Survivor Series]], he remained a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]]. In [[December 2001]], Booker T joined forces with [[Vince McMahon]] and [[Ray Traylor|The Boss Man]] and [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feuded]] with [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]]. After Booker T cost Austin a match against [[Chris Jericho]] for the [[WWE Undisputed Championship]] at [[WWE Vengeance#2001|Vengeance 2001]], Austin gained revenge by attacking Booker T in a [[Supermarket|grocery store]], humilitating him by covering him in [[food]].  <br/>-<br/>-Booker T won the WCW World Tag Team Championships for an eleventh time, this time with [[Andrew Martin|Test]]. In addition, he held the [[WWE Hardcore Championship]] twice in [[May 2002]]. When the WWE roster was split into two groups, Booker T was [[WWE Draft|drafted]] to ''[[WWE RAW|RAW]]''.<br/>-<br/>-Booker T joined the WWE version of the [[nWo]] in [[2002]], but was thrown out of the group by [[Shawn Michaels]], thus [[turn (professional wrestling)|turning]] [[face (professional wrestling)|face]]. He formed a successful tag team with [[Virgil Runnels III|Goldust]], another enemy of the nWo and won the [[World Tag Team Championship|World Tag Team Championships]]. By [[2003]], Booker T's popularity had soared and he amicably separated from Goldust in order to pursue the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]]. In [[February 2003]] he eliminated [[The Rock (entertainer)|The Rock]] to win a [[battle royal]] for the number one contendership, granting him a title shot at [[WrestleMania XIX]].<br/>-<br/>-Several weeks before WrestleMania, the incumbent champion, [[Triple H]], cut a controversial [[Promo (professional wrestling)|promo]] on Booker T in order to gain [[Heat (professional wrestling)|heat]]. Triple H downplayed Booker T's WCW success, pointing out that the WCW Championship had been held by non-wrestlers like Vince Russo and actor [[David Arquette]]. He implied that Booker T, as a black wrestler, would never win a world championship in WWE. Booker T went on to lose to Triple H at WrestleMania, falling victim to a [[Botch (professional wrestling)|botched]] Pedigree.<br/>-<br/>-Booker T remained on ''RAW'' for another year, trading the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship]] with [[Jason Reso|Christian]] and winning the World Tag Team Championships a third time, this time with [[Rob Szatkowski|Rob Van Dam]]. On [[March 22]], [[2004]] he was traded to ''[[WWE SmackDown!|SmackDown!]]'' along with [[Dudley Boyz|The Dudley Boyz]] in exchange for Triple H. On ''SmackDown!'', Booker T quickly established himself as a heel again by disparagingly referring to ''SmackDown!'' as the "minor leagues". He first ruffled the feathers of then WWE champion, the late [[Eddie Guerrero|Eddie Guerrero]]. He then feuded with former partner Rob Van Dam, then with [[Mark Calaway|The Undertaker]] in a feud which saw him utilise [[voodoo]] magic in order to try and overcome his "supernatural" foe. Later Booker immersed himself in a feud with [[John Cena|John Cena]], winning the vacant [[WWE United States Championship]]. Eventually, a [[playoff format|Best-of-Five]] series of matches was booked to determine the undisputed United States champion, which Cena won back in the fifth match at [[WWE No Mercy|No Mercy 2004]].<br/>-<br/>-On [[October 21]], 2004, ''SmackDown!'' general manager [[Theodore Long]] placed Booker T in a six man tag team match with Rob Van Dam and [[Oscar Gutierrez|Rey Mysterio]] against [[John Layfield|John "Bradshaw"Layfield]], [[René Goguen|René Duprée ]] and [[Kenzo Suzuki]]. Bradshaw expected Booker T to betray his partners, but instead Booker T pinned Bradshaw, this turning face once again. Booker T faced Bradshaw for the [[WWE Championship]] at the [[Survivor Series#2004|2004 Survivor Series]] on [[November 14]], but lost after he was hit in the head with the championship belt. <br/>-<br/>-In [[March 2005]], Booker Huffman signed a two-year contract extension with WWE, quelling rumors that his retirement was imminent.<br/>-<br/>-Booker T's wife Sharmell was soon introduced to ''SmackDown!'' and became his valet, leading to a feud with [[Kurt Angle]], who began [[stalking]] Sharmell. Angle referred to Sharmell as a "gutter slut", claiming that he "liked it". The feud ended when Booker T defeated Angle at [[WWE Judgement Day#2005|Judgement Day 2005]]. In [[July 2005]] Booker T began a feud with Christian, who he defeated at [[The Great American Bash]].<br/>-<br/>-[[Image:Booker T US Title.jpg|thumb|Booker T, with his wife [[Sharmell Sullivan|Sharmell]], after winning the United States Championship.]]<br/>-On the October 20th edition of ''SmackDown!'', Booker T was placed in a match against Chris Benoit for the [[WWE United States Championship]]. He won the match due to an unseen assist from Sharmell. Although Booker T is believed to have become a heel, he had yet to turn due to him being unaware of his wife's doings. On the following edition of ''SmackDown!'', General Manager Theodore Long showed footage of Sharmell interfering in Booker T's matches. Later Booker T and Sharmell went to apologize to Benoit and give him a rematch, but instead they both attacked Benoit, officially turning heel. Booker was then boast that he had been fully aware of what Sharmell had been doing and had been playing dumb to fool everyone.<br/>-<br/>-On [[November 25]], 2005 Booker T fought against Benoit for the United States Championship. Booker T was stripped from the belt by Theodore Long, because of the confusion of who won since they pinned each other at the same time. Long decided to put the Benoit and Booker against each other in a best of seven series, just like the one the two had in their WCW days. The two met at Survivor Series for the first match for the vacant United States Championship, which Booker T won.<br/>-<br/>-He increased his lead to 2-0 during a special live episode of ''SmackDown!''. On [[December 9]], 2005, an episode of ''SmackDown!'', Booker T increased his lead 3-0. At [[WWE Armageddon#2005|Armageddon 2005]], in a must win match for Chris Benoit, Booker T tapped out to the Crippler Crossface, making the series 3-1.<br/>-<br/>-At a [[house show]] in [[White Plains, NY]] on [[December 26]], [[2005]], Booker T strained his [[groin]] [[muscle]], which will reportedly take four to six weeks to heal. Booker T was scheduled to face Chris Benoit in Match 5 of the Best of Seven Series at the ''SmackDown!'' tapings the following night. At the beginning of the show, general manager [[Theodore Long]] said that Booker would have to [[forfeit]]. Both Booker and Benoit protested (Benoit not wanting a cheap victory). Booker managed to persuade Long to allow him to choose a stand-in for the match. After shooting down Orlando Jordan's request, Booker selected [[Randy Orton]] as a stand-in. Benoit claimed victory over Orton via disqualification, due to interference from Sharmell.<br/>-<br/>-In Match 6, taped on January 3rd, Benoit again beat Orton via disqualification, this time from Orlando Jordan after Jordan promised to rise to the occasion earlier that night.  This tied the series at 3 matches apiece.<br/>-<br/>-In the last contest, Match 7, on January 13(Taped January 10) Randy Orton once again acted as a substitute, pinning Chris Benoit following Booker T hitting the latter with the United States Title Belt giving Booker the series and the championship. Orton shook Booker's hand after the win but then informed Booker he "owed me one," presuambly with a future title shot.<br/>-<br/>-==Personal information==<br/>-In 2000, Huffman appeared in the film ''[[Ready to Rumble]]'' as himself.<br/>-<br/>-In [[April 2002]], Huffman opened a retail outlet in [[Houston, Texas]] at 12313 Bellaire Boulevard.

The vast majority of international organizations consider modern ethnic Macedonians a distinct ethnic group.<br/>+<br/>+Historians generally date the arrival of the Slavs in Macedonia and the Balkans to the 6th or 7th centuries AD. The Macedonians had little or no political and national identity of their own until the [[20th century]]. Medieval sources traditionally describe them as Bulgarians, a definition which survived well into the period of Ottoman rule as attested by the Ottoman archives and by descriptions of historians and travellers, for example [[Evliya Celebi]] and his ''Book of Travels''.<br/>+<br/>+In the late [[19th century]] and the beginning of [[20th century]], there were lot of clashes of Serbophile Chetniks (originating from Macedonia) and Bulgarophile Komitas all over the Slavic-speaking Macedonia, which shows the lack of their proper national feeling.<br/>+During the Turkish rule, the Macedonians had little or no political and national identity of their own until the [[20th century]]. <br/>+<br/>+[[19th century]] ethnographers and travellers were generally united in identifying them as Bulgarians until the period between [[1878]] and [[1912]] when the rival propaganda machines of Serbia, Greece and Bulgaria succeeded in effectively splitting the Slavophone population of Macedonia into three distinct parties, a pro-Serbian, pro-Greek and pro-Bulgarian one ([http://knigite.abv.bg/en/hb/index.html Henry Brailsford]).<br/>+<br/>+The key events in the formation of a distinctive "Macedonian" identity thus came during the first half of the 20th century in the aftermath of the [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912-1913 and especially following the [[Second World War]].<br/>+<br/>+==The Balkan Wars==<br/>+The Balkan Wars resulted in drastic changes to Macedonia's demographics after the Ottomans were forced out of the region. Ottoman Macedonia was carved up between the Balkan nations, with its northern parts coming under Serbian rule, the southern under Greece and the northeastern under Bulgaria. <br/>+<br/>+The territory of the present-day Republic of Macedonia came under the direct rule of Serbia (and later the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]), and was sometimes termed "southern Serbia", and it officially, together with a large portion of today's southern Serbia, belonged to the newly formed Vardar banovina (district). An intense programme of "Serbianization" was implemented during the [[1920s]] and [[1930s]], during which time the local population were forcibly assimilated into Serbian culture. Between the world wars in Serbia Macedonian dialects was treated as a Serbian dialects (UCLA Language Material Sources, [[http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/]]). Only the literary [[Serbian language]] was taught, it was the language of education, media, and public life; even so Macedonian literature was tolerated as a local dialectal folkloristic form. Serbian National Theatre in Skopje even performed some of the Macedonian language plays (now the classical drama pieces) (UCLA Language Material Sources, [[http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/]]).<br/>+<br/>+Greece adopted strongly repressive policies towards the Slavic population in its northern regions, mainly due to Bulgaria's expantionist policy during the [[Second Balkan War]]. Those that inhabited northeastern Greece fled to Bulgaria or Serbia after the [[Balkan wars]] or were exchanged with Greeks from Bulgaria under a population exchange treaty in the [[1920s]]{{fact}}. <br/>+<br/>+The Slavophones that stayed in northwestern Greece were regarded as a potentially disloyal "Bulgarian minority" and came under severe pressure, with restrictions on their movements, cultural activities and political rights; as a result many emigrated, for the most part to [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[USA]] and eastern European countries like Bulgaria.{{fact}} A number of Macedonian Slavic and Turkish place names and Slavic personal surnames were renamed during this period (eg. Lerin becoming [[Florina]], Nachev becoming Natsulis [http://www.hrw.org/reports/pdfs/g/greece/greece945.pdf])  This was a government sponsored process of Hellenization.[http://www.hrw.org/reports/pdfs/g/greece/greece945.pdf] Many of the border villages were closed to outsiders, ostensibly for security reasons. The Greek government and people have never recognized the existence of a "Macedonian" ethnic group, as the term "Macedonian" is already reserved for the ethnic Greek population that has traditionally inhabited Greece's northern-most region ([[Macedonia (Greece)]]).<br/>+<br/>+On August 10, 1920, upon signing the Treaty of Sevres to protect its national minorities, the [[Image:Abecedar2.jpg|250px|thumb|right|ABECEDAR school book]] Greek government notified the [[League of Nations]] that ''"measures were being taken towards the opening of schools with instruction in the Slav language in the following school year of 1925/26"''. Thus, the primer intended for the Macedonian children in Greek Macedonia to learn their native language in school, entitled "ABECEDAR" [http://www.mymacedonia.net/aegean/hellenization.htm],  [http://www.gate.net/~mango/GR_evidence_H_Andonovski.htm] [http://www.makedonika.org/ABECEDAR.htm] was offered as an argument in support of this statement. This primer, prepared by a special government commissioner was published by the Greek government in Athens in 1925, but was printed in a specially adapted Latin alphabet instead of the traditional [[Cyrillic]], since Cyrillic was the official alphabet of neighboring Bulgaria and Serbia. The book was to be held up as proof that a Macedonian Slavic tongue exhisted and that it was neither Bulgarian nor Serbian, but a distinct language protected and encouraged by the State. This would mean that the Greek government officially recognized for the first time a separate national entity of the Macedonians within Greece. But after fears from Serbia and Bulgaria that the Macedonians in their borders might demand the same rights, the Abecedar school books were confiscated and destroyed before it got into the reach of the children [http://www.hrw.org/reports/pdfs/g/greece/greece945.pdf HRW pg.42].<br/>+<br/>+==Macedonians after the Second World War==<br/>+[[Image:19_begalci1.jpg|thumb|250px| Macedonian refugees from Greek Macedonia fleeing across the border during the Greek Civil War]]<br/>+After the Second World War, the [[Communist]] Yugoslav leader [[Josip Broz Tito]] decided that the policy of Serbianization in Macedonia had failed - it had led to strong resentment of Belgrade. In addition, the Macedonians had been strong supporters of Tito's [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Partisan]] resistance movement, fighting the occupying Bulgarians, Germans and Italians as well as opposing the Serbian royalist [[Chetnik]]s, who were, until midway through the war, the West's favorite rebels in Serbia. The Macedonian resistance had a strongly nationalist character, not least as a reaction to Serbia's pre-war repression, same as to the Bulgarian repression during the beginning of the Bulgarian occupation of the region.{{fact}} It was clear well before the end of the war that Tito would seek major changes to the region's political balance.<br/>+<br/>+Following the war, Tito supported the separation of Yugoslav Macedonia from Serbia, making it a republic of the new federal Yugoslavia (as the People's Republic of Macedonia) in [[1946]]. He also supported the concept of a separate Macedonian nation, as a means of further severing the ties of the Slav population of Yugoslav Macedonia with Bulgaria, which were already questionable after the strong Macedonian resistance to the Bulgarian occupation. The differences between the Macedonian and Bulgarian language were emphasized and the region's historical figures were promoted as being uniquely Macedonian (rather than Serbian or Bulgarian). A separate [[Macedonian Orthodox Church]] was established, splitting off from the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] in 1967 (only partly successfully, because the church has not been recognised by any other Orthodox Church yet). The ideologists of a separate and independent Macedonian country, same as the pro-Bulgarian and pro-Serbian sentiment was forcibly suppressed.{{fact}}<br/>+<br/>+Tito had a number of reasons for doing this. First, he wanted to reduce Serbia's dominance in Yugoslavia; establishing a territory formerly considered Serbian as an equal to Serbia within Yugoslavia achieved this effect. Secondly, he wanted to sever the ties of the Macedonian population with Bulgaria, which could undermined the unity of the Yugoslav federation. Thirdly, Tito sought to justify future Yugoslav claims towards the rest of geographical Macedonia; in August [[1944]], he claimed that his goal was to reunify "all parts of Macedonia, divided in 1915 and 1918 by Balkan imperialists." To this end, he opened negotiations with Bulgaria for a new federal state, which would also probably have included Albania, and supported the Greek Communists in the [[Greek Civil War]]. The idea of reunification of all of Macedonia under Communist rule was abandoned in [[1948]] when the Greek Communists lost and Tito fell out with the Soviet Union and pro-Soviet Bulgaria.<br/>+<br/>+Tito's actions had a number of important consequences for the Macedonian. The most important was, obviously, the promotion of a distinctive Macedonian identity as a part of the multiethnic society of Yugoslavia. It may be only the subject of speculations whether Tito forced the Macedonian consciousness on the population of Yugoslav Macedonia or simply lifted the last restrictions to an already existing national sentiment. There have been numerous accounts from northern Macedonia from the late [[1940s]] that the policy of Bulgarization during the Bulgarian occupation ([[1941]]&ndash;[[1944]]) was as abhorrent for the ordinary Macedonian as the policy of Serbization until then.{{fact}} [[IMRO]]'s leader in exile, [[Ivan Mihailov]], and the renewed Bulgarian IMRO after 1990 have, on the other hand, repeatedly argued that between 120,000 and 130,000 people went through the concentration camps of Idrizovo and Goli Otok for pro-Bulgarian sympathies or ideas for independent Macedonia in the late 1940s., which has also been stated by former prime minister [[Ljubčo Georgievski]] [http://www.b-info.com/places/Macedonia/republic/news/95-11/nov15.mak ].{{fact}} The critics of these claims question the number as it would implied roughly a third of the male Christian population at that time; and the reasons of imprisonment, they argue, were multiple as there were Macedonian nationalists, Stalinists, Middle class members, Albanian nationalists and everybody else who was either against the post war regime or denounced as one for whatever reasons. Unlike the time before WWII, when Macedonia was hotbed for unrest and terror and about 60% of the entire royal Yugoslav police force was stationed there [http://www.unet.com.mk/mian/shs.htm] [http://knigite.abv.bg/en/ib/i_banac.html], after the war there were no signs of disturbances comparable with pre-war times or post war times in other parts of former Yugoslavia, such as Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia. [http://www.balkan-archive.org.yu/kosta/new.ustase/list.html] [http://www.pavelicpapers.com/documents/odpor/index.html] [http://www.pavelicpapers.com/documents/ratline/index.html]. Whatever the truth, it was certainly the case that most Macedonians embraced their official recognition as a separate nationality. Even so, some pro-Bulgarian or pro-Serbian sentiment persisted despite government suppression; even as late as [[1991]], convictions were still being handed down for pro-Bulgarian statements.<br/>+<br/>+In Greece, they faced considerably tighter restrictions as its government saw them as a potentially disloyal minority. Greeks were resettled in the region in two occasions, firstly following the Bulgarian loss of the [[Second Balkan War]] when Bulgaria and Greece mutually deported their populations ([[1913]]){{fact}}, and secondly in [[1923]] as a result of the population exchange with Turkey that followed the Greek military defeat in Asia minor. After the Second World War many of the Macedonians who lived in Greece either chose to emigrate to Communist countries (especially Yugoslavia) to avoid prosecution for fighting on the side of the Greek communists (see: [[Greek Civil War]]), or were forced to do so.{{fact}} Although there was some liberalization between [[1959]] and [[1967]], the Greek military dictatorship re-imposed harsh restrictions. The situation gradually eased after Greece's return to democracy, but Greece still get's many critics about the poor treatment of its minorities. <br/>+<br/>+The Macedonians in Albania faced restrictions under the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] [[dictatorship]] of [[Enver Hoxha]], though ordinary Albanians were little better off. Their existence as a separate minority group was recognised as early as 1945 and a degree of cultural expression was permitted.<br/>+<br/>+As ethnographers and linguists tended to identify the population of the Bulgarian part of Macedonia as Bulgarian in the interwar period, the issue of a Macedonian minority in the country came up as late as the [[1940s]]. In [[1946]], the population of [[Blagoevgrad Province]] (also referred to as Pirin Macedonia) was declared Macedonian and teachers were brought in from Yugoslavia to teach the [[Macedonian language]]. The census of [[1946]] was accompanied by mass repressions, the result of which was the complete destruction of the local organisations of the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] and mass internments of people at the Belene concentration camp. The policy was reverted at the end of the [[1950s]] and later Bulgarian governments argued that the two censuses of [[1946]] and [[1956]] which recorded some 200,000 Macedonians were the result of pressure from [[Moscow]]. Western governments remained, however, mistrustful and continued to list the population of Blagoevgrad Province as Macedonian until the beginning of the [[1990s]] despite the [[1965]] census which put Macedonians in the country at 9,000.{{fact}} The two latest censuses after the fall of Communism (in [[1992]] and [[2001]]) have, however, confirmed the results from previous censuses with some 3,000 people declaring themselves as "Macedonians" in Blagoevgrad Province in 2001 (<1.0% of the population of the region) out of 5,000 in the whole of Bulgaria.<br/>+<br/>+During this period, ethnic Macedonians living in the region continue to complain of official harassment.

The coat-of-arms is composed by a double bent garland of ears of wheat, tobacco and poppy, tied by a ribbon with the embroidery of a traditional folk costume. In the centre of such a circular room there are mountains, rivers, lakes and the sun; where the ears join there is a red five-pointed star, a traditional symbol of [[Communism]]. All this is said to represent "the richness of our country, our struggle, and our freedom".<br/>+<br/>+<br/>+* '''''Lion:''''' The lion first appears in 1595 in the Korenich-Neorich coat of arms, where the coat of arms of Macedonia is included among with those of eleven other countries.

Later versions of these coat of arms include a more detailed crown and lion with the word "Macedonia" written in a scroll like style.

Some say that in last 15 years their have been disagreement among the Slavophone Albanian citizens about their being members of a Macedonian nation.{{fact}}<br/>+<br/>+* '''Bulgaria''' maintains generally cordial relations with the Macedonians, recognizing them as a distinct ethnic group and last counting them in the [[2001]] census. However, Macedonian groups in the country have reported official harassment, with the Bulgarian Constitutional Court banning a small Macedonian political party in [[2000]] as separatist and Bulgarian local authorities banning political rallies. The 5000-strong Macedonian population in Bulgaria claims to have experienced a period of intensive assimilation and repression.<br/>+<br/>+* '''Greece''' does not recognise any ethnic minorities. Legally, Greece only recognises a "religious minority", the [[Greek Muslim minority]], in [[Thrace]], and opposes the use of the term "Macedonians" to refer to the country's Slav minority, which is centred on the northern Greek town of [[Florina]]. The term "Slavomacedonians" is sometimes used instead, to distinguish them from the Greeks who inhabit Macedonia. There is a Slavic macedonian political party in Greece, the [[Rainbow Party]]: their last (2004) election tally amounted to 6,176 votes (or 0.1%) nationwide (2,955 in the region of Macedonia - out of which 1,200 in the Prefecture of [[Florina]] - and the rest 3,221, were from other parts of Greece.

(This list may contain some small errors). The number of districts in Pakistan has grown since 1947.<br/> <br/>-'''Raga ''' (<i>r&#x0101;g</i> /&#x0930;&#x093e;&#x0917; ([[Hindi]]), <i>raga</i> (Anglicised  from <i>r&#x0101;ga&#x1e25;</i>/&#x0930;&#x093e;&#x0917;&#x0903; ([[Sanskrit]])) or <i>r&#x0101;gam</i> /&#x0bb0;&#x0bbe;&#x0b95;&#x0bae;&#x0bcd; ([[Tamil language|Tamil]])) are the [[musical mode|melodic modes]] used in [[Indian classical music]].  "Raag" is the modern Hindi pronunciation used by Hindustani musicians; "Ragam" the Tamil form used by Karnatak [[Carnatic music]] musicians.<br/>+Under the older system in effect before August 2000, the ''district'' was the fourth level of government. Pakistan was divided into provinces which contained administrative units called ''divisions'' which contained ''districts''. In August 2000, under the new system, the ''division'' was abolished as an administrative tier, and the provinces are directly divided into ''districts''. <br/> <br/>-A raga functions both as description and prescription.  It describes a generalized form of melodic practice; it prescribes a set of rules for how to build a [[melody]]. It specifies rules for movements up (<i>aarohanam</i> [&#2310;&#2352;&#2379;&#2361;&#2339;&#x092e;&#x094d;]) and down (<i>avarohanam</i> [&#2309;&#2357;&#2352;&#2379;&#2361;&#2339;&#x092e;&#x094d;]) the [[musical scale|scale]], which [[note (music)|notes]] should figure more and which notes should be used more sparingly, which notes may be sung with ''[[gamaka]]'', phrases to be used, phrases to be avoided, and so on.{{ref|FN1}}The result is a framework that can be used to [[musical composition|compose]] or [[improvisation|improvise]] melodies, allowing for endless variation within the set of notes.<br/>+A ''district'' is further subdivided into [[tehsil]]s ([[Town]]). Tehsils may contain villages or municipalities. There are over five thousand local governments in Pakistan. Since 2001, these have been led by democratically elected local councils, each headed by a Nazim (the word means "supervisor" in Urdu, but is sometimes translated as "mayor.") Women have been allotted a minimum of 33% seats in these councils; there is no upper limit to the number of women in these councils.<br/> <br/>-Although notes are an important part of raga practice, it by no means exhausts what a raga is.  A raga is more than a scale.  Many ragas share the same scale.<br/>+The [[Karachi District]] as it stands today was made by merging the districts of Karachi Central, Karachi East, Karachi South, Karachi West and Malir.<br/> <br/>-The underlying scale may have [[pentatonic|five]], [[hexatonic|six]] or [[heptatonic|seven tones]] made up of [[swara]]s. This provides one method of classifying ragas. Ragas that have five swaras are called <i>audava</i> (&#2324;&#2337;&#2357;) ragas; those with six, <i>shaadava</i> (&#2359;&#2366;&#2337;&#2357;); and with seven, <i>sampoorna</i> (&#2360;&#2306;&#2346;&#2370;&#2352;&#2381;&#x0923;) ([[Sanskrit]] for 'complete'). Those ragas that do not follow the strict ascending or descending order of swaras are called <i>vakra</i> (&#2357;&#2325;&#2381;&#2352;) ('crooked') ragas. <br/>-(<i>To see the order of notes, check the article on [[swara]].</i>)<br/>+== Islamabad Capital Territory ==<br/>+[[Islamabad]]<br/> <br/>-The basic mode of reference is that which is equivalent to the Western [[Ionian mode]] (this is called ''[[Bilawal]] thaat'' in Hindustani music).  All relationships between pitches follow from this basic arrangement of intervals.  In any given seven-tone mode, the second, third, sixth, and seventh notes can be [[natural]] (''shuddha'', lit. 'pure') or [[flat]] (''komal'', 'soft') but never sharped, and the fourth note can be natural or [[sharp]] (''tivra'') but never flatted, making up the twelve notes in the Western [[equal tempered]] [[chromatic scale]] (but without Western pitch equivalencies like, for example, A# and Bb). Ragas can also specify [[microtonal]] changes to this scale: a flatter second, a sharper seventh, and so forth.  Treatises from the first millennium report that the octave used to be divided theoretically into 22 microtones ("shrutis"), but by the 16th century, this practice seems to have died out.  Furthermore, individual performers treat pitches quite differently, and the precise intonation of a given note depends on melodic context.  There is no [[absolute pitch]]; instead, each performance simply picks a ground note, which also serves as the [[drone]], and the other [[scale degree]]s follow relative to the ground note.<br/>+== Districts of Balochistan ==<br/>+<table><tr><td><br/>+There are 26 districts in Balochistan.<br/> <br/>-Some Hindustani (North Indian) ragas are prescribed a time of day or a season.  During the rains, for example, many of the Malhar group of ragas--associated with the monsoon--are performed.  Some musicians take these prescriptions very seriously.  However, since the majority of concert hall performances take place in the evening and night, musicians often have to make concessions for the sake of public performance.  <br/>+<table><tr><td valign=top><br/>+* [[Awaran District|Awaran]]<br/>+* [[Barkhan District|Barkhan]]<br/>+* [[Bolan District|Bolan]]<br/>+* [[Chagai District|Chagai]]<br/>+* [[Dera Bugti District|Dera Bugti]]<br/>+* [[Gwadar District|Gwadar]]<br/>+* [[Jaffarabad District|Jaffarabad]]<br/>+* [[Jhal Magsi District|Jhal Magsi]]<br/>+* [[Kalat District|Kalat]]<br/>+* [[Kharan District|Kharan]]<br/>+* [[Kohlu District|Kohlu]]<br/>+* [[Khuzdar District|Khuzdar]]<br/>+* [[Qilla Abdullah]]<br/>+</td><td valign=top><br/>+* [[Qilla Saifullah]]<br/>+* [[Lasbela District|Lasbela]]<br/>+* [[Loralai District|Loralai]]<br/>+* [[Mastung District|Mastung]]<br/>+* [[Musakhel District|Musakhel]]<br/>+* [[Nasirabad District|Nasirabad]]<br/>+* [[Panjgur District|Panjgur]]<br/>+* [[Pishin District|Pishin]]<br/>+* [[Quetta District|Quetta]]<br/>+* [[Sibi District|Sibi]]<br/>+* Turbat or [[Kech District|Kech]]<br/>+* [[Zhob District|Zhob]]<br/>+* [[Ziarat District|Ziarat]]<br/>+</td></tr><br/>+</table><br/>+</td><td><br/>+[[Image:Balochistan Tehsils.jpg|right|thumb|325px|The districts and tehsils of Balochistan]]<br/>+</td></tr><br/>+</table><br/> <br/>-The two streams of Indian classical music, [[Carnatic music]] and [[Hindustani music]], have independent sets of ragas. There is some overlap, but more "[[false friend|false friendship]]" (where raga names overlap, but raga form does not). In north India, the ragas have recently been categorised into ten <i>thaats</i> or parent scales (by Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande, 1860-1936); [[South India]] uses a somewhat older, more systematic classification scheme called the <i>[[melakarta]]</i> classification, with 72 parent (<i>melakarta</i>) ragas.

It might seem to imply that scales came before ragas, or that ragas are made from scales.  In fact, it's the other way round--parent scales (both melas and thats) were induced from raga practice.

He is widely credited with saving the [[Apollo 12]] mission after it was struck by lightning shortly after liftoff and was one of the central figures during the famous [[Apollo 13]] recovery efforts. <br/> <br/>-==[[Auto racing|Auto Racing]]==<br/>-*[[Stock car racing]]:<br/>-**[[NASCAR Championship]] - [[Darrell Waltrip]]<br/>-**[[Bobby Allison]] won the [[Daytona 500]] <br/>-*[[Champcars|CART Racing]] - [[Rick Mears]] won the season championship<br/>-**[[Indianapolis 500]] - [[Gordon Johncock]]<br/>-*[[Formula One|Formula One Champion]] - [[Keke Rosberg]] of [[Finland]]<br/>-*[[24 hours of Le Mans]]:<br/>-**won by the team of [[Jacky Ickx]] / [[Derek Bell (auto racer)|Derek Bell]] driving a [[Porsche|Porsche 956]]<br/>-*[[Rally racing]] - [[Walter Röhrl]] in an [[Opel]] won the [[World Rally Championship]]<br/>-**[[Walter Rohrl]] / [[Christian Geistdorfer]] won the [[Monte Carlo Rally]] driving an [[Opel|Opel Ascona 400]]<br/>-*[[Drag racing]] - [[Shirley Muldowney]] won the [[NHRA]] [[Top Fuel]] championship.<br/>+==Early life==<br/> <br/>-==[[Baseball]]==<br/>-* [[July 13]]: [[Montreal]] hosts the first [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|MLB All-Star Game]] outside the [[United States]].

The NL has now won 19 of the last 20 contests. Concepción was named the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|MVP]].<br/>+Aaron was the youngest of eight children born to a struggling southwestern [[Oklahoma]] farmer and cattle rancher.  He attended [[Bethany Nazarene College]] for a year before transferring to [[Southwestern Oklahoma State University]].  After<br/>+graduating, he planned to become a teacher but was hired by NASA and became a [[EECOM]] specialist. <br/> <br/>-*[[August 18]]: [[Pete Rose]] sets record with his 13,941st plate appearance.<br/>+==NASA career==<br/> <br/>-*[[World Series]]: [[St. Louis Cardinals]] won 4 games to 3 over the [[Milwaukee Brewers]].

The capsule was struck by lightning 36 seconds after liftoff causing a power surge.  Instruments began to malfunction, communication became garbled, and [[telemetry]] data was lost.  NASA considered aborting the flight.  <br/> <br/>-* [[NBA|NBA Finals]]:<br/>-**[[Los Angeles Lakers]] won 4 games to 2 over the [[Philadelphia 76ers]]<br/>+Several months before the flight, Aaron had been going over simulator data when he, on his own initiative, began examining the obscure ''Signal Condition Equipment'' system and its functions. He became one of the only mission controllers who was familiar with the system and its operations.  He recommended that the flight crew set the system to "auxiliary" mode to try to restore the system.  <br/> <br/>-*[[Basketball World Championship|FIBA World Championship]]<br/>-**[[USSR]] World Champion<br/>+When he gave the order, "Flight, try SCE to 'Aux'", most of his mission control colleagues had no idea what he was talking about.  CapCom asked him to repeat the recommendation.   [[Pete Conrad]]'s response the order was, "What the hell is that!"  Fortunately [[Alan Bean]] was familiar with the switch's location and initiated the command.  Telemetry was restored and the mission was saved. <br/> <br/>-==[[Boxing]]==<br/>-*[[November 12]] [[Aaron Pryor]] defeats [[Alexis Arguello]] in what would later be called the ''fight of the decade''.

Flight Controller [[Gene Kranz]] put Aaron in charge of the vessel's power supply.  He was in charge of rationing the spacecraft's power during the return flight.  He is also credited with developing the innovative powerup sequence that allowed the Command Module to conserve enough power for a safe reentry.  <br/> <br/>-==[[Cycling]]==<br/>-*[[Giro d'Italia]] won by [[Bernard Hinault]] of [[France]]<br/>-*[[Tour de France]] - [[Bernard Hinault]] of [[France]]<br/>-*[[World Cycling Championship]]: [[Giuseppe Saronni]] of [[Italy]]<br/>+Going against existing NASA protocol, he ordered the instrumentation system to be turned on last, just before reentry, rather than first.  The call was a calculated risk.  Without the instrumentation system, the crew and controllers would not know for certain if the cold startup had been successful until the last possible moment before reentry.  However without this sequence change, the capsule would has exhausted its battery supply too early to allow for a safe reentry.  The crew was safely recovered and Aaron was lauded for his innovation.   <br/> <br/>+===Later career===<br/> <br/>-==[[Field Hockey]]==<br/>-*[[March 20]]: In an international women's field hockey match at Wembley Stadium,England.

Sorry for that. What a difficult question it is... It's more or less like asking what do the Greek people think of, say, Asia. I can't generalize that much and note that what I write below is solely my own point of view. It would be much easier if you asked me some less general question. And my POV might be crooked a tad since I'm relatively young (24), I live in a big town (Warsaw) and I'm a student. <br/>-<br/>-Having said that, I don't think that the Polish attitude towards the USA has changed much in last 50 years. Of course, there is a certain mistrust in the US, as well as certain level of.. err.. dissatisfaction? with George W. Bush and his ways, but still America is considered a natural ally of Poland and a state that is generally friendly towards Poland. Poland is a tad different from the rest of Europe in that people here generally like America and support it (even over the Afghanistani and Iraqui cases). At least that's what polls say. <br/>-<br/>-The same applies to Western Europe, though here we could generalize even less. When it comes to Germany, there is still certain animosity towards Germans (especially among the elderly people), mostly because of what the Germans did during WWII, but it's probably the only "Western" country average people care for in Poland. The rest of Western Europe is, as far as I can tell, composed of a mixture of beliefs, stereotypes and experiences, typical to all European states. You know, if you asked an average Pole of France, the only thing he would say would be "Paris, Eiffel tower, wine and Jacques Chirac". UK consists of London and the queen, Spain consists of ETA, FC Barcelona and Real Madrid (perhaps corrida as well), Greece is Acropolis and women with large noses and so on. I doubt an average Pole differs here from an average Brit, Greek or Romanian, for that matter.

A big issue I see, though, is the Notes:  It's set up so the same work is cited on the same note every time - the result is that note 6 appears both ''before'' and ''after'' note 8.

[[User:JASpencer|JASpencer]] 13:24, 25 January 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+: That's not the point - wikilinks are contextual - if you want to link in Catholicism and Freemasonry, you need to mention it as such.

It's sort of like pointing Vatican to the banking scandal - accurate, but tangential as far as the name is concerned.  Furthermore, we're not supposed to point readers to discussions, we're supposed to point them to factual articles so they can make up their own minds.  Your phrasing makes it sound like you're trying to convince the reader of your position, and that's not what the purpose of WP is.  I do think that the article is important, though, and I would suggest adding it as a "see also" at the end of the section instead of trying to work it into the article, as I don't think it fits as it is written.

[[User:MSJapan|MSJapan]] 22:42, 29 January 2006 (UTC)<br/>+::::::: In order for that statement to be NPOV it must be clearly stated in the article that The Masons believe it to be .... not "some sources".

If the article said "The mason's handbook claims that the rituals are beautiful" that would be different.  Inherently Biased sources are still ok to be added to an article while maintaining that article's NPOV status, however it should be pointed out to the article's reader where that information is coming from. <font color="FF3399">[[User:SeraphimXI|Seraphim]]</font> 22:49, 29 January 2006 (UTC)<br/>+:::::::: This is what I'm talking about - fundamental errors.  We ''don't have'' a standard handbook.  Everyone in every jurisdiction has their own, and they aren't all exactly the same.  The quote actually comes from a publically available book by a Masonic writer, Albert Mackey, not some organizationally written book.  Everything written is written by individuals, not the Fraternity.  No one person speaks for Masonry, nor does one ritual, one sign, one anything.  Fundamental errors... [[User:MSJapan|MSJapan]] 22:57, 29 January 2006 (UTC)<br/>+::::::::: All i'm saying is that it should be stated that the source is written by a mason. It's not "Other sources" calling the system beautiful, it is a mason himself saying that it's beautiful.  The fact that it's someone giving something he is directly involved in a complement means that there is an inherent bias in the statement, that the readers of this article must be made aware of. It's not "other sources" in general that are saying this, it's a single source, written by a mason, talking about masonic practices. <font color="FF3399">[[User:SeraphimXI|Seraphim]]</font> 23:12, 29 January 2006 (UTC)<br/>+:No, it's a Masonic writer quoting directly from his standard source, so there is a very big difference.  You are claiming bias based on the fact that you say Mackey wrote the quote about the Fraternity he was involved in, and I'm telling you that that is not the case, because Mackey is not the originator of the quote.  Mackey takes the statement from a ritual book, and as it's a lot easier for a general reader to get Mackey than it is for them to get and understand a ritual book, we used Mackey.

The claim and fact dialog in the last section is particularly blatant.

Nothing wrong with that, but the text did need to be cleaned up.<br/>+:I personally am a bit dubious with putting anti-freemasonry as one homogenous movement, as sites such as masonic info do.  After all the Catholic prohibition on freemasonry may influence Evangelical doubts - but it is hardly the same.  Similarly totalitarian dislike of all autonomous groups (especially secret ones) is not really tied in with theological objections to naturalistic religions.  The anti-establishment critique of masonic influence may be made by some Catholics or Communists, but it is also made by a lot of people who are neither Catholics or Communists for reasons to do with neither theology nor a fear of potential opposition groups. <br/>+:This is not an attack on the editors here, it's just an observation that if a page like this is for historical reasons mainly maintained by people with one point of view then it will tend to get biased quite easily.[[User:JASpencer|JASpencer]] 13:23, 30 January 2006 (UTC)<br/>+::JAS, Anti-Masonry has a long and complex history, just as Masonry does.  It has taken many forms over the years, and many different groups (each for their own individual reasons) have come out against the Fraternity.  That in itself makes the topic worthy of an article. it is similar in scope to anti-semitism.  Spain during the reconquista had very different motives for anti-semitism than Germany during the Nazi period, but both need to be discussed in an article on anti-semitism.  You are correct that Anti-Masonry is not a homogenous movement, Catholics and Communists each have their own motives for being Anti-Masonic... but they have the common bond of being anti-masonic.  It is a broad category and it deserves to be given its own article, seperate from Freemasonry just as a discussion about anti-semitism should be seperate from an article on judeism.  Each article can mention the other, and linking them is proper Wiki protocol.  But they should be seperate. [[User:Blueboar|Blueboar]] 13:52, 30 January 2006 (UTC)<br/>+:JASpencer, I don't think you were here before, but the problem with getting an anti-Masonic editor is that the page becomes a cut and paste of FreemasonryWatch.  Factual research done by others has shown that that particular material (especially the Satanic stuff) is a complete fabrication.  I did some looking around myself at one point, and found the same thing that people like Art DeHoyos did, and that was that much of the material was connected to Freemasonry only because a man who eventually became a Mason wrote it at some point in his life.  It would be POV to let the argument stand as fact.  What then happens is that we get into revert wars because of [[WP:V]] and the fact that most anti-Masons are anti-Masons because they either refuse to read critically or they are evangelical Christians - they think the article is here to say what they want and what they think rather than be an information resource by presenting claims and fact.  For example, would it be fair for the Anti-Semitism article to say Jews eat babies because somebody said so, and then not refute it as an unfair accusation (and in fact a blatant lie)?  Without refutatory material, the article is POV.<br/>+:As Blueboar said, though, that's only part of the argument, and in order to cover other political and religious reasons, we need space.  This is partially why the article was broken out in the first place.  If we merge it back in, we can't really deal with it properly, and history has shown this.

That's why I set the tags so that this one would be merged into the other, since it is obviously a sub-section of the Freemasonry article.  Also I realize that if the merger happens, this article will be shortened substancially.  That is 100% ok since NPOV does not mean equal time, it just means that each side must be given appropriate attention.  Where people are being unfairly silenced, is all the people arguing that they won't allow anti-masonic editors "and the fact that most anti-Masons are anti-Masons because they either refuse to read critically or they are evangelical Christians - they think the article is here to say what they want and what they think rather than be an information resource by presenting claims and fact" yet when people try to present real critisism's they are attacked and then their claims are attacked with counter-arguments that they are not given the chance to respond to.   Instead this article is a history of masonic persecution by anti-masonic groups. Stating "As a general rule, anti-Masonic claims, especially with regard to Satan worship, stem either from a lack of comprehensive reading, from a lack of understanding of the symbolism, or the usage of quotes outside of their context" in an encyclopedia article is rediculious, we are suppossed to present and deal with facts, and you cannot say that all anti-masonic claims come from a lack of comprehensive reading, symbol interperataion, and usage of quotes outside of their context.  For me I believe that the root of it is problary the secrecy surrounding the group, and the fact that members are not allowed to discuss certain "secrets".  If those secrets didn't exist i'm sure most of the critisims would not exist either. Also on that note i'd like to point out a contridiction i've been running into alot the past few days.  It has been pointed out to me over and over that any information pertaining to the secrets is unverifiable, therefore nothing definate can be said about what the secrets are.  However you guys are quick to say stuff like "While there have been many claims made against Freemasonry, the claims of Satan worship, being both the most pervasive and the most long-lasting of the accusations leveled at Freemasonry on an institutional level, are also the most untrue." however in saying that you are saying that the contents of the secrets have nothing to do with Satan, which is a contradiction, you can't have it both ways. <font color="FF3399">[[User:SeraphimXI|Seraphim]]</font> 08:18, 31 January 2006 (UTC)<br/>+:::::: Not to attack any other point that you have made, but the claims of satanic worship amongst the Masonic Order is simply untrue, Masonry has its very roots in the judeo-christain belief and (as it has been shown by this article) stresses belief in a "Divine Being" whether this is God, or Jehovah, or Yahweh is irrelevant and it doesnt seem possible that this claim has any base in fact, this is an article based on facts not the allegations of evangelical Christians.  Their points should be properly addressed and given the attention that they are due, then the facts should make themselves known.  Im not a veteran wikipedia editor or anything of the sort so if ive said anything in the wrong please correct me, but as someone who has had my life saved by Masons i can vouch for their validity, this is not a satanic order nor should it be stated that it is or isnt when there is no basis in fact, only assumptions, thanks for your time. [[User:f1r3r41n|f1r3r41n]] 13:07, 31 January 2006 (UTC)<br/>+::Seraphim - you are showing a very POV attitude here.  You seem to have made the assumption that one of the secrets of Masonry is that Freemasons worship Satan.  Since they do not, there is no contraditcion in stating that the contents of the secrets have nothing to do with Satan.  In the context of this article, the ''fact'' that some people say Freemasons worship Satan is verifiable and worthy of inclusion, it is part of Anti-Masonry.  To keep the Article NPOV, we include the Masonic responce to that claim.  Stating: "As a general rule, anti-Masonic claims, especially with regard to Satan worship, stem either from a lack of comprehensive reading, from a lack of understanding of the symbolism, or the usage of quotes outside of their context" is not POV nor oppinion.  It is fact. If you look at the article several examples of this have been given.  Finally, please remember that this is an article about a distict phenonina known as Anti-Masonry, not a place to "prove" Freemasons are evil.

I don't believe that it's a satanistic group at all.  I'm just pointing out that you cannot have it both ways.  If you want to insist that nobody can know what the secrets are since they are secret, you also cannot dismiss claims by saying that "that's not what the secrets are".

[[User:Blueboar|Blueboar]] 01:59, 1 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+:::::There's nothing wrong with that, what is wrong is the way  it's set up.  If you look at the history of the page, the person that added all the counter-claims originally listed them as responces, and any other information that is added to the article gets reverted.  If you look though the page's history, there was a few times a completly sourced article about freemasons and nazi germany that is just being outright removed, also I noticed that alot of the "facts" that respond to the claims are mainly pointing out that the person who wrote it was not a mason at the time, or was not speaking of masonry, however as is pointed out numerous times also, inorder to be a mason you must believe in a supreme being.  If someone is a satan worshiper and writes books about it, then later becomes a mason, claims that he wasn't a mason at the time seem to be pointless, since it inferrs that masonry allows people who worship satan in since it falls under the belief in a divine being portion of their requirements.  (Of course i'm not saying at all that masons are satan worshipers, i'm just trying to point out that some of the "facts" listed as counter-points to the claims can just as easially be dismissed as the "claims" they follow).  Also i'd like to point out yet again.  My original reason for slapping the NPOV tags on these 2 pages is that this is a POV content fork.  It fits all the requirements as such, and this page should be deleted and the content represented in some way over on the main freemasonry page. <font color="FF3399">[[User:SeraphimXI|Seraphim]]</font> 03:34, 1 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+::::::I'm going to get you for lack of knowledge on your part again.  Most likely, what was removed was added by a user or sockpuppet of a user who was banned from editing any articles regarding Freemasonry.  Furthermore, the article you mention was sourced from FreemasonryWatch, which was also decided by the WP ArbCom to not be a valid source of information.  It was a copyvio for FMW to have it posted, and it was copyvio for us to use it, as it was not in the public domain.  That's not POV, that's policy.  I will also point out that your argument is false.  None of those books were about Satanism, they were about magic, and had nothing to do with Masonry.  They were made to be Masonic by later editing because maybe 10 or 20 years later the author became a Mason.  ''That's'' the point.  Don't conflate the arguments in order to make a point.  I'm also going ot point out again that this is no more a content fork than Anti-Semitism, and if we merge them back, we're going to get the same arguments that it's not covered properly, because it is simply too large a subject to cover adequately in one article.  In short, you want to take an encylopedia article and turn it into a stub because you disagree with it.

"Distinct" means "Readily distinguishable from another" and "Clearly defined," not "homogeneous."

This is certainly not a danger that has been guarded against here.  [[User:JASpencer|JASpencer]] 21:26, 2 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::::I do agree that there needs to be more alot more work in this article in this area.  Right now, I believe it is too much in a "claim -> fact" format and it should be more in a listing of the anti-masonic groupings (i.e. Facsist Anti-masons, Catholic Anti-masons, Conspiracy Theorist Anti-masons, etc) with refutes allowed for each of their claims.  Even as a mason, I do not believe the current format is nutural enough.  Each one of these groups are very different with different arguements, but still fall under the umbrella of being anti-masonic.  Nowhere should catholics be grouped with facsists or a 1830's political party be grouped with autocratic islamic governments, inregards to this article.  Each of these sub-groupings of anti-masonry deserve their own section in this article along with a general historical outline of all the movements.  This will serve as the only point of convergence in their idealogies.  However, the refutes can not be removed at all, many falsities and misquotations have been made regarding freemasonry and if the quote stays (which we may decide to remove or not), the refute must also stay.  Although, I also believe that the current "claim -> fact" wording should be changed to "claim -> refute" to stay within NPOV.  In my mind, well referenced and logical refutes will easily stand up to many of these claims, without having to push the term "fact."  Just my teo cents.

Also i'd like to point out, that alot of the "FACT" sections that come after the "CLAIM" sections are not facts, but interpertations of the facts.  For example the claim from Albert Pike 33° Legendas XIX° ~ XXX° Pg. 40 - 44 is rebutted with a so called "Fact" that contains the wording "This passage seems to be an expansion on a New Testament passage".  Another one "Helena Petrovna Blavatsky 32° Ancient and Accepted Primitive Rite Grand Orient of France The Secret Doctrine" is rebutted as saying "This is conflating two things: one, the Antient and Accepted Primitive Rite was started by John Yarker in the United States, and had nothing to do with the Grand Orient of France." however it's been pointed out over and over to me that the secrets vary from lodge to lodge, and that nobody in one lodge can possibly know what the secrets of another lodge are. Therefore how do they know that The Ancient and Accepted Primitive Rite is US only.  Another thing, a few of them are dissented as saying that the person did not become a mason untill after the book was published.  However the year the person joined is not cited, I don't even know if it is possible to prove that.

[[User:JASpencer|JASpencer]] 18:06, 3 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+<br/>+::I am [[Wiccan]], and I am not currently nor have I ever been a [[Freemasonry|mason]]. My father was once an entered apprentice, way back when I was like 2 years old, that's about it. [[User:Ardenn|Ardenn]] 18:07, 3 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:::And that's more than is really any of your business. [[User:Ardenn|Ardenn]] 18:09, 3 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+:: I don't have a religious affiliation, I don't believe in religions.  And I don't think I know any masons, and being female it's impossible for me to be one. The reason i'm being "stubborn" about this is if you look at the talk page History, this has been pointed out numerous times, the pages have been merged numerous times, at one point they debated changing this page's name to "critisims of freemasonry" but that was shot down because they felt the page would then be a PoV fork.  And everytime someone mentions this or tries to deal with the NPOVness of this article they end up posting something like "I give up".  For me to just sit back and let some obvious POV material stand on wikipedia would make me a bad editor. If I feel it's not NPOV I cannot morally sit by and let it stay up on wikipedia.  I do wish I never read the article in the first place, because I wouldn't have jumped into this  mess, but now that I have read the article, I can see the bias of the editors, and it needs to be fixed.  If you want proof of the bias in the articles, look at the main Freemasonry page, up in the top paragraph it says "in some sources, as "a beautiful system of morality veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."" when discussing the secret rituals, what the article fails to mention is that it is not "some sources" it is one source, that just happens to be a masonic handbook, yet when I proposed to change the text from "some sources" to point out that it comes from a masonic handbook, I was told that it would be adding needless information to the article, and that saying "some sources" wasn't misleading at all.  Last time I checked the word sources is plural, meaning more then one source, and the quoted line is only found in one source that is written by a mason.  If I wrote an article calling myself beautiful I would be accused of being biased, yet apparently when a mason calls the masonic rituals beautiful it's justifiable since masons are the only legitimate sources as to what the contents of the rituals are, even though if you find another source that says something bad about the rituals, that is an unverifiable source since nobody can disclose anything about the rituals, contradiction anyone? <font color="FF3399">[[User:SeraphimXI|Seraphim]]</font> 18:40, 3 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:::I'll break this down one last time:  the "beautiful system" quote comes from Macoy, in a book freely available to the public (it's still in print, and can be purchased in many bookstores or online).  There was also some discussion as to the fact that the quote appears in certain rituals (noted by those who have those rituals).  However, it does not appear in all rituals, as they vary depending on jurisdiction, and even within jurisdictions.  Therefore, it is not possible to cite ''every'' instance of its appearance, but there is ''evidence'' of more than one source.  Macoy is just one man, and even though he called his book ''The Masonic Manual'', it was never adopted as a standard handbook anywhere.  So, anything else he says is merely his own experience, and not a universal fact regarding Masonry.  Therefore, it is not a violation of NPOV not to say it comes from a Masonic handbook, because it really doesn't.<br/>+:::As far as anti-Masonic sources go, many of them are third-hand at best (if not outright fabrication), and as the authors of these sources have never taken part in the rituals, they aren't particularly qualified to comment on them; everything they say is purte conjecture not supported by fact.  For example, in [[Freemasonry]], the oaths are plainly stated to have been changed to remove the penalties, and while it's not dated, I believe it was over 30 years ago at this point.  Therefore, to take a source from 1875 regarding the penalties and quote it as fact that is applicable to the modern day is at the very least uncritical research, and at most an outright lie (anti-Masonic sources do not value fact very highly).<br/>+:::You are also mistaking knowledge for POV.  If someone stated that the Moon was made out of green cheese because a book said so, it would be removed by those who know that it isn't.  However, if it was stated that people ''used'' to believe that the Moon was made out of green cheese, that is acceptable and correct.  Similarly, to claim that the signs and secret words of Masonry are X when there is no modern proof to show this is incorrect.  However, I can clearly show that the signs and words are not standard from place to place (I have a citation from ''Freemasonry for Dummies''), and thus to claim otherwise is wrong.  The secrets are secret, and therefore there is no authoritative modern source to verify what any of the secrets are.  However, as there is a evideced statement that says the secrets are not standard, to include them in a general article is misleading. <br/>+:::There is a particular scope to these Masonic articles, and we need to stay within it. [[User:MSJapan|MSJapan]] 22:06, 3 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::::I think some important history is being overlooked here; the history of bad faith edits by Masonic editors on the Freemasonry related pages and the history of the creation of the so-called 'anti-freemasonry' page.<br/>+<br/>+::::On the first point Masonic editors have shown a pattern of refusing to allow any contributions by non-masonic editors to stand for very long, if at all. The large number of Masonic editors on this page exercise complete defacto control of the content of this page and it should be said by definition they are POV as they have all taken very extreme and serious oaths to each other and the 'society', which they do in fact take VERY SERIOUSLY. These Masons consider their oaths and obligations solom ones. This is not a normal Wikipedia situation, we basically have the situation where a cult has decided to take over all pages related to itself and control in a co-ordinated fashion it's content. Masonic editors such as MSJapan have absolutely no interest in being NPOV. They have an interest in wearing down non-masonic editors and Wiki arbitrators so they will give up, with this they have been extremely successful.<br/>+<br/>+::::In regard to the history of this page it is actually fairly involved. Basically the latest version of the page came about after a group of these Masonic editors decided amongst themselves to remove a half dozen pargraphs on the main Freemasonry page entitled 'Criticism of Freemasonry'. These criticism para's were put there after another lengthy merge debate between the exact same issues which are being discussed now. This shows that the Masonic Editors who have been here for a long time did not respect the decision to merge the old Masonic criticm and Freemasonry page. They just waited a bit and started the fork up again. You see the whole point of creating the misnames 'anti-freemasonry' page was to remove all the criticism of freemasonry to a secondary page and then systematically gut it. Which as you can see they did, now for the second time. So it is a false game being played here. All the material about 'Totalitarianism' was added after moving the criticisms to the new page, and most of the criticism sections have been gutted or deleted. You see today I added a See Also link to the P2 Scandal, well there used to be a complete entry about that as well as much else about persecutions of the church under masonic regimes in Latin America and such.<br/>+<br/>+::::The problem on these pages is the ill will of the Masonic Editors to having anything remotely resembling a NPOV ariticle on the subject. Time and again they destroy all rewrites or critical information. Establish consensus? It is a phony consensus, because the only consensus the Masonic Editors have is to come back and delete any material they don't like. They are acting as a long term group - a lodge, where as the non-masonic editors come and go. The only solution is to permanently ban all know Freemasons from editing any pages on freemasonry or assign a neutral academic to write a balanced Freemasonr entry and put a permanent lock on the page. Any other work your contribute here now will be utterly futile because in a week or a month they will just delete it all and we will be back to square one again.[[User:Basil Rathbone|Basil Rathbone]] 17:25, 5 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+== Content Fork ==<br/>+<br/>+I thought I would try to seperate out the issue of whether this is a content fork or not.  Could I ask for one statement for why it is a content fork and one statement for why it is an article in it's own right.[[User:JASpencer|JASpencer]] 13:15, 3 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+::You can ask, but I doubt that you will get just one statement.  Let me repeat what I said above: Anti-Masonry has a long and complex history, just as Masonry does. It has taken many forms over the years, and many different groups (each for their own individual reasons) have come out against the Fraternity. That in itself makes the topic worthy of an article. it is similar in scope to anti-semitism. Spain during the reconquista had very different motives for anti-semitism than Germany during the Nazi period, but both need to be discussed in an article on anti-semitism. You are correct that Anti-Masonry is not a homogenous movement, Catholics and Communists each have their own motives for being Anti-Masonic... but they have the common bond of being anti-masonic. It is a broad category and it deserves to be given its own article, seperate from Freemasonry just as a discussion about anti-semitism should be seperate from an article on judeism. Each article can mention the other, and linking them is proper Wiki protocol. But they should be seperate. [[User:Blueboar|Blueboar]] 13:58, 3 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+::I replied to the discussion further down as well, but in my opinion, this should be an article in its own right because:<br/>+::* It is clearly a complex issue in and of its own right.  To merge the articles would by necessity cause the issue to not be examined in the depth it needs to be examined in order to understand it.  There are far too many facets to consider for it to work effectively.<br/>+::* It is historically important (as I have stated before, so I won't elaborate here).  Anti-Freemasonry has impacted politics and affected religion and society in many times and places for different reasons.  These reasons simply cannot be fully explained and explored within the confines of a section in the Freemasonry article.<br/>+::*It would also limit what could be considered worthy of an article.  To pick an example you will know well, I ''could'' say that the extent of the view of Catholicism and Freemasonry is that Catholics don't agree with it.  However, as you have shown in your article on the topic, there is a lot more to the relationship of Catholicism and Freemasonry than simply the blanket generalization I made, and my statement doesn't really tell you anything.<br/>+::It really is the Masonic equivalent of anti-Semitism.  The hatred and accusations are based on the same sorts of flimsy premises, they recur frequently, and in certain segments of the population, it is definitely ingrained.  There are evangelical Christian ministries online dedicated to "converting" Masons.  The Nazis published propaganda about the Masons, and persecuted them for being such.  In Europe, many people are as suspicious of Masons as they are of Jews.<br/>+::Since the topic is large and complex, that alone should justify an article, so to call this a content fork really undermines the importance of the whole movement.[[User:MSJapan|MSJapan]] 22:31, 3 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:::Not a statement, more a quibble.  Anti-semitism is very much based on the opposition to Judaism as something alien and unrooted in the dominant culture.  For example it would be irresponsible to say that theological objections to Judaism are de facto anti-semitic or that criticisms of the Israeli millitary are anti-semitic (although the motivations of both may be anti-semitism).  You can see a thread of continuity between Roman, Medieval, Renaissance, Nineteenth Century and Twentieth Century positions.<br/>+:::Anti-freemasonry simply does not have this thread of continuity.  In fact one of the dominant themes of criticism is that it is too tied in with the dominant establishment.  The totalitarian dislike of freemasonry is similarly not based on the alieness or otherwise of freemasons, but on their potential as an opposition force.  The Catholic suspicion of freemasonry may have started as a suspicion of it's English protestant origins, but it quickly became a theological critique of freemasonry informed by the anti-clerical actions of many Freemasons.  The evangelical anti-freemasonry position is similarly a theological objection to freemasonry (informed by the propensity of many Protestant denominations to become dominated at the top levels by members of Masonic lodges).  I do not see a dominant theme other than "they all disliked Freemasons".[[User:JASpencer|JASpencer]] 18:03, 3 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+::::I do not intend to go over this again...

If you research the arguments, the majority of the arguments are based on the same hoaxes and other fabricated materials.  What has happened, however, is that as time has passed, other tangentially related (and some unrelated) things have crept in to the mix.  The Taxil hoax, the Morgan Affair, and a lot of creative editing have been the basis of the arguments for almost 200 years out of Freemasonry's documented almost 300 year existence.  The same letter that Pike supposedly wrote is still used today, although it was debunked before the start of the 20th century.  The prior interests of a particular group of members at the beginng of the 20th century have been brought out time and time again.  Even the religious objections are nothing new, but they still apply.  The same arguments have been used in different times and places, so I would say that there is indeed clear evidence of continuity.

There is also the same criticism of the "other" that holds anti-semitism together.  Anti-semitism is an independent strain of thought.

Notwithstanding that the work done on this article has made it much more readable and managable.  I do feel that there is one issue which is missing from the discussion here though.  Anti-Masonic activities have gone beyond, and continue to go beyond, just dislike.  Masons continue to be subject to discrimination, something which I expect neither Blueboar and MSJapan have actual experience of, given the highly overt nature of American Freemasonry.  As such I think their arguments tend towards a historical/ academic approach which risks the impact being watered down into little more than a curiosity.

The point I'm making is that the article is beginning to make A-F look like little more than a historical curiosity, the impact is real and that is not being communicated, not that it was previously anyway.  Current policies in the UK actively discriminate agasint Freemasons however they have been found to be illegal under European Law and as such the wording is being fudged (weasel-words) to continue that discrimination whilst opening up the definitions of what is, and is not, covered by the various items of legislation.  The reason for that is mainly down to the 'Cronyism' allegations however not limited to that.  the difficulty is that any evidence would tend to be in legal findings, or evidence, and as such not really usable in this form if there is a strict adherence to published citations.  For example the evidence presented to an Industrial Tribunal for unfair dismissal has to present to 'balance of probability' rather than 'beyond reasonable doubt' which would be required in a civil suit.  A difficult balance to strike, making the article meaningful in the current environment means drawing in material which does not appear to meet the expectations of those editing here whilst elsewhere in Wikipedia, it would.

Freemasonry watch is notorious for changing quotations and is not considered a reliable source (we put this to an AfV a while ago on the Freemasonry page and the Admins agreed).  Thus, we have to qualify our citations.  For example, while I am sure that Holly made use of essentially the same quote that is reported on our article, I do not know if Freemasonry watch "edited" it.  We have to either link the quote directly to him, or qualify that it came second hand through Freemasonry watch.  I would have similar problems with any of the other citations, but I am especially sceptical of Freemasonry watch.  I am not sure if you can do that using the foot note/reference format... but if you can, I am in favor of trying (it keeps the text of the article from being broken up with citations.) Good luck [[User:Blueboar|Blueboar]] 16:45, 5 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:I'm sure this could be done in the Masonic counter-claim or in the footnote.

Although masonry is accused of seperating church from the social sphere, it most definitely does deny this accusation.  Furthermore, "a seperation of church from the social sphere" is almost the same thing as anti-clericalism.  "Religious Tolerance" means that masonry recognizes and respects the beliefs or practices of all religions, which is very much different than "a seperation of church from the social sphere."  Since a church is a specifically Christian body, this would imply that masonry does not deny that it is attempting to remove Christianity from the "social sphere" or society.  This is most definitely denied by masons!  Furthermore, in [[User:JASpencer|JASpencer]]'s edit summary for this change siad to "see talk page," there is nothing on this page about the change from "Religious Tolerance" to "a seperation of church from the social sphere."

Tintin was largely based on Hergé's earlier character '''Totor''', a [[Scouting|boy-scout]] with a striking resemblance to Tintin. The comics starring Totor, ''Les aventures de Totor, chef de patrouille des Hannetons'', appeared in the magazine ''Le Boy-Scout Belge'' between [[1926]] and [[1929]].  In the later comic book series, Tintin is a young [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[journalist|reporter]] (as well as an accomplished [[fighter]] and [[Aviator|pilot]]) who becomes involved in dangerous cases in which he takes heroic action to save the day. Almost every adventure features Tintin hard at work at his investigative reporting, but rarely does he actually turn in a story. He is a young man of more or less neutral attitudes and is less colourful than the supporting cast around him.  Tintin's character changes in the last albums, starting with ''[[The Castafiore Emerald]]''. Tintin no longer actively seeks out adventure but rather gets taken along with what happens around him (this is especially evident in ''[[Flight 714]]'' and ''[[Tintin and the Picaros]]''). Some fans consider this final complete album a betrayal of the Tintin image.<br/>-<br/>-Shortly before his death, former Belgian [[Nazi]] collaborator [[Léon Degrelle]] created controversy by stating that the Tintin character was originally based on himself. Degrelle had indeed known Hergé during his early career as a journalist, but this allegation is generally considered a fabrication of the notorious self-booster Degrelle. The earlier version of Tintin was apparently inspired, at least in part, by Hergé's youngest brother. Hergé later became estranged from his brother, and depicted him as the villainous [[Colonel Sponz]] in ''[[The Calculus Affair]]''. Tintin and Sponz, although physically very different, have actually quite similar hair spikes.<br/>-<br/>-== Snowy (''Milou'') ==<br/>-<br/>-[[Image:SnowyMilou.png|thumb|left|120px|A severely inebriated Snowy ''(Milou)''.]]<br/>-Snowy, an exceptionally [[white]] [[fox terrier]], is Tintin's four-legged companion, who travels everywhere with him. The bond between the dog and Tintin is deeper than life, and they have saved each other from perilous situations many times. <br/>-<br/>-With a few exceptions, Snowy never speaks (although he is regularly seen thinking in human words), since he is only a dog. However, he always manages to communicate well with Tintin despite this. Snowy often adds to the story in many interesting ways.  For instance, Snowy is the only character in ''[[Flight 714]]'' to remember that he was abducted by [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]]. <br/>-<br/>-Like Captain Haddock, Snowy is fond of [[whisky]] of the ''[[Loch Lomond]]'' brand, and his occasional bouts of drinking tend to get him into trouble, as does his raging [[arachnophobia]]. <br/>-<br/>-''Milou'' was named after [[Hergé]]'s first [[girlfriend]], a contraction of the name ''Marie-Louise'', although the character is referred to as male throughout the books.<br/>-<br/>-{{Tintin characters}}<br/>-<br/>-[[Category:Tintin characters]]<br/>-[[Category:Fictional pairs]]<br/>-[[Category:Fictional reporters|Tintin]]<br/>-[[Category:Fictional dogs|Snowy]]<br/>-<br/>-[[cs:Tintin]] [[da:Tintin]] [[de:Tim und Struppi]] [[es:Tintín]] [eo:Tinĉjo]] [[fr:Tintin]] [[id:Tintin]] [[nl:Kuifje]] [[ja:タンタンの冒険旅行]] [[fi:Tintti]] [[pl:Tintin]] [[sv:Tintin]] [[wa:Tintin]] [[zh:丁丁]]<br/>+'''''Charmed''''' is a U.S. [[television series]] by [[Aaron Spelling]] about three sisters who are powerful good [[witch]]es known throughout the [[supernatural]] community as "The Charmed Ones."

After moving into the old family manor in [[San Francisco]], the youngest sister, Phoebe, discovered an old book in the attic. Reading an incantation from the [[Book of Shadows (Charmed)|Book of Shadows]], she set in motion events that fulfilled an ancient prophecy. Strange and frightening occurrences began which eventually led the sisters to realize that they are witches. <br/>+<br/>+The sisters discovered that they actually are descended from a long line of witches. The first powerful witch in the line, Melinda Warren, prophesied that from her line would come the [[Charmed Ones]]. A force of good, they would be three sisters gifted with powers to battle the forces of evil. Prue Halliwell, the oldest sister, developed the power of [[telekinesis]], later gaining the power of [[astral projection]]. Piper, the second-oldest, was given two powers regulating the speed of molecules in objects and people, first gaining the ability to slow them down to the point where they are frozen and later gaining the ability to accelerate them so much as to cause explosions. Phoebe, the third sister, had the original power of [[premonitions]] and later obtained the power to [[levitate]]; in addition, her original power grew and she became an [[empath]]. She is not expected to get her other powers back due to budget problems.<br/>+<br/>+After Prue was killed, it was revealed that there is a secret fourth sister, Paige Matthews, their mother's illegitimate child. She has the power to "[[Orb (charmed)|orb]]" in and out from place to place like [[teleportation]], to orb objects to herself or another place and the power to glamour, which allows her to change her appearance. She has the same mother, [[Patty Halliwell]], as the other three, but her father was their mother's [[whitelighter]] [[Sam Wilder|Sam]].  Hence how she can "orb", which is her whitelighter power, she was also trying to use the whitelighter power of healing earlier on in the series. Patty and her Whitelighter lover gave Paige up for adoption, with the sole condition being that the adoptive parents give her a first name beginning with "P".<br/>+<br/>+A central theme throughout the show's run is the sisters' struggle to balance normal lives with their supernatural responsibilites. The burden of keeping their Charmed destinies a secret from the outside world has repeatedly created tensions in their friendships, workplaces and romantic relationships. Only a few know their secret and help them on a regular basis. The most important is Leo Wyatt, a [[whitelighter]] assigned by the [[Elder (Charmed)|Elders]] to guide and protect the sisters. Leo means a great deal to the sisters both professionally and personally: he heals their wounds, advises them collectively and individually and mediates between them and the enigmatic Elders. He is the love of Piper's life, her husband and father of her two children; their romance is an ongoing plot thread that dates back to the first season. A few of the others who have kept the Charmed Ones' secret over the years and appeared in the opening credits are Police Inspectors Andy Trudeau and Darryl Morris, tormented half-demon Cole Turner a.k.a. Belthazor, the mysterious time-traveler [[Chris Perry]] and more recently Billie Jenkins. <br/>+For more in-depth summaries of the show's plot and character arcs, see [[Charmed Season Summaries]].<br/>+<br/>+===Behind the scenes history===<br/>+{{spoiler}}<br/>+The original lineup of sisters was [[Prudence Halliwell]], [[Piper Halliwell(-Wyatt)|Piper Halliwell]] and [[Phoebe Halliwell]], played by [[Shannen Doherty]], [[Holly Marie Combs]] and [[Lori Rom]] respectively. Lori Rom only played Phoebe Halliwell in the original series pilot, but left the show due to personal reasons. [[Alyssa Milano]] took on the role of Phoebe Halliwell shortly after and portions of the pilot were reshot to incorporate Milano into the episode. The original pilot was never aired, but can be found circulating around the Internet.<br/>+<br/>+The broadcasted premiere for Charmed attained 7.70 Million Viewers, the highest (premiere rating) debut ever for The WB Network. None of the other The WB Network shows have been able to break this record.  <br/>+<br/>+''Charmed'''s viewers were very stable at 6-8 million viewers a week until rumors arose about disagreements between Doherty and Milano. However, this was never confirmed nor denied by Doherty or Milano's publicist/agents. Shannen Doherty left ''Charmed'' at the end of the 3rd Season and as the 4th Season continued, Prue was killed off permanently and an episode covering the events which lead to the two sisters finding a previously unknown fourth half-sister called [[Paige Matthews]], played by [[Rose McGowan]] was aired. The viewers sank to around 3.5 million viewers in the seventh season. The eighth season, however, rose to an average of 4-4.5 million viewers, with 2005's last episode ''Vaya Con Leos'' bringing in 4.44 million viewers and it has a season average of 4.182 million viewers.<br/>+<br/>+While later seasons are often noted by a decline in make-up and special effects budget, season six is still often thought of as the year when special effects were at their best and most perfected. Demons in the early seasons were portrayed as monsterous in appearance though they sometimes could take human forms, but in later seasons, most demons appear as humans due to the ever lowering budget the show receives each year.<br/>+<br/>+''Charmed'' is currently in its 8th and probably final season on [[The WB Television Network|WB]].  As of January 2006, it surpassed ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'' as the longest-running television series with multiple female leads. There have been various rumours appearing in mostly fan circles in connection with whether one or more of the main actresses would leave the show after season eight or not. However, nothing has yet been officially announced or confirmed either by the WB or by the show's producer Brad Kern about a ninth season or a possible spin-off.  It is also unknown at current time if the show will be part of the new [[CW Network]] lineup that will be created when The WB and UPN (whose current lineups should form the crux of the new network) both cease their independent operations in September 2006.<br/>+<br/>+===Licenses===<br/>+The series, which has been running since [[1998]], is shown on the [[The WB Television Network|WB]] television network in the [[United States]] and on [[CTV]] in [[Canada]].

From the 4th season onwards, the veteran leading actresses receive the coveted first and last billing while their new costar gets the middle spot: Alyssa Milano, Rose McGowan, and Holly Marie Combs as "Piper". The leads are then followed by whichever supporting players are contracted for that particular season. If one of the supporting players does not appear in a particular episode, his/her name also does not appear in the opening credits. Brian Krause, who became a main cast member halfway through the 2nd season, was in virtually every episode by the 3rd season. His name is listed 4th in the credits from season 3 onwards, apart from in season 8 where Kaley Cuoco (Billie) takes that spot.<br/>+<br/>+===Main cast (The Charmed Ones) ===<br/>+<br/>+====Piper Halliwell====<br/>+[[Image:CharmedHollyMarieCombs.jpg|thumb|right|Holly Marie Combs as Piper Halliwell]]<br/>+[[Piper Halliwell]]: portrayed by [[Holly Marie Combs]] (1998-present); credited "and Holly Marie Combs as 'Piper'" beginning in Season 4. <br/>+<br/>+Piper Halliwell, born the middle child, had been the mediator in Prue and Phoebe's fights. Piper, from the beginning had an "unlucky in love" storyline, as seen in the main love storyline of Seasons 1 to 3 with her and Leo. Piper was blessed with the power of [[temporal stasis]]/[[Molecular Immobilization]] or freezing time. Piper worked as a chef and then manager of a restaurant, "Quake" until the end of Season 1, when she quit and started her own nightclub in Season 2, called "P3". In Season 3, Piper and Leo decided to get married, but Prue's astral projection form caused problems.  There was some trouble during the ceremony and Piper, afraid the marriage was not meant to be, called the wedding off.  However, later on in the episode she changed her mind and she and Leo got married.  She developed the power of [[Molecular Combustion]] or blowing up objects. She could not be overwhelmed with demons because her molecular combustion power is extremely powerful. <br/>+<br/>+Tragedy quickly followed her joy when her older sister, Prue was severely injured by a high-level demon during an attempt to save an innocent, which, without help arriving in time, led to her eventual death. Thus, in Season 4, Piper inherited the eldest sister role from Prue continuing a new (and, for a time, amateur), but eventually more powerful Power of Three with the arrival of Paige. <br/>+In Season 5, she gave birth to her first baby boy, Wyatt and at the end of Season 6, baby Chris was welcomed into the world as well. Wyatt was feared from the start to be the strongest source of magic from his birth, leading to many attacks and attempts to turn him towards the dark side. In Season 6, adult Chris visited from the future to stop Wyatt turning evil. During Season 6, Leo and Piper separated from each other because Leo became an Elder. During Season 7, Leo was tested to choose his destiny - whether he wanted to be an Elder or live powerless with Piper. Leo had been influenced by the Elders, but eventually had "fallen from grace" and became mortal to live with his family. At the end of Season 7, Leo and Piper were somewhat more happy together.<br/>+<br/>+At the end of the first story arc of the eighth season, the love between Piper and Leo was tested once again. Leo, now without all his previously possessed powers, met his fate and lost his life in a car accident. Piper arranged for Leo to be preserved in a magical container, a sort of cheating death. Losing Leo, as is revealed by an Angel of Destiny, will be motivation for an upcoming battle which will require all of the sisters' thinking, power and experience.<br/>+<br/>+====Phoebe Halliwell====<br/>+[[image:Phoebe04.jpg|thumb|right|Alyssa Milano as Phoebe Halliwell (season 4 promo pic.)]]<br/>+[[Phoebe Halliwell]]: portrayed by [[Alyssa Milano]] (1998-present); credited "and Alyssa Milano" from Seasons 1 to 3.<br/>+<br/>+Phoebe Halliwell was the youngest child, until Paige was discovered and was very free-spirited in discovering her powers. The show focused a lot on her of how she developed as a character and her occupation. She had been given the power of [[clairvoyance|premonition]] or "seeing the future and past", since Prue had earlier said, 'She never looks towards the future...' In Season 2, Phoebe decided to leave unemployment to go back to college and complete her degree.  During Season 3, Phoebe achieved the ability of [[levitation]] and came in contact with an attorney, who unbeknownst to her, was a half-demon named Cole Turner, aka Belthazor. This love was not only harmful to her, but it also caused the death of her oldest sister, Prue.<br/>+<br/>+Her love for him featured prominently in the show through Seasons 3 and 4, to the extent that she crossed to the dark side. She became the Queen of the Underworld for a short time and was carrying the 'Heir to the Source' or the 'Spawn of all Evil'. In Season 5, however, Phoebe left Cole and eventually vanquished him. Cole would return in later episodes to try and revive his love with Phoebe, never successfully. Around Season 6, she developed a power that she couldn't control very well: empathy. [[Empathy]] is the ability to feel and hear emotions, often allowing control of others' powers. During a magical mission, Phoebe saved a columnist from a perilous situation. The columnist decided as a token of her appreciation to give her a job. Phoebe soon became a columnist for the column, later titled 'Ask Phoebe' at the 'Bay Mirror' and became very attracted to her new boss, Jason Dean - until she was possessed by Mata Hari, where she explained all the weird occurrences were because she was a witch. For this reason, they briefly separated from each other. She went on sabbatical for a short time and got a ghost writer to take her place, a man named Leslie ([[Nick Lachey]]) who she fell in love with. They were a short-lived couple and he had to leave on account of his temporary position. <br/>+<br/>+Her powers were stripped for a short period of time from the end of Season 6 to the beginning of Season 7 as a punishment for using her power and spells for personal gain. Phoebe had fallen in love with one of the teachers, Drake, at Magic School, but finds that her love won't last since he is set to die within two weeks. She was single as the season ended. In Season 8, Phoebe is looking for love again. She then finds Dex Lawson, who believes the real Phoebe Halliwell to be dead, who is played by [[Sex and the City]]'s [[Jason Lewis]], previously was to be played by [[Extra]] host, [[Mark McGrath]]). The two were briefly married untill she concluded that their love wasn't meant to concieve a child, but to convince her into coming clean as having faked her death. Later in season 8, the Elders send Cupid under the name "Coop" to be an active matchmaker for her, but some fans speculate that his [[Cyrano de Bergerac]] position means he himself will fall in love with her.<br/>+<br/>+====Prudence "Prue" Halliwell====<br/>+[[Image:PrueHalliwell.jpg|thumb|Actress Shannen Doherty as Prue]]<br/>+[[Prudence Halliwell]]: portrayed by [[Shannen Doherty]] (1998-2001)<br/>+<br/>+Prue was the eldest and most powerful sister character in seasons one to three. She was the one who took care of Phoebe and Piper after their mother died when they were very little. Being the first born, she inherited the most power from the family line. She was romantically involved with [[Andy Trudeau]] in Season 1, but at the end of Season 1, he died saving her life. During the 1st Season, she had developed the power of [[telekinesis]], which is the ability to move objects with her mind. She worked at Buckland's Auction House until halfway through Season 2, when she quit to become a photographer at 415 magazine. Prue had gained the power of [[astral projection]] in Season 2, which is the ability to project a spectral form to a distant location, although Prue's version of Astral Projection was tangible/solid and could touch things. <br/>+<br/>+Prue spent a lot of time and energy becoming a more powerful witch, and was referred to sometimes as the "superwitch" of the family. She had trouble with the right balance of work and play right up until her death at the end of Season 3 by the hands of the wind demon Shax, The Source's chief assassin. With Prue's death, the power of three was temporarily destroyed, only to be restored shortly after that when Piper and Phoebe found out they had another sister. After Prue died, Piper got the responsibility of playing the role of the oldest sister.<br/>+<br/>+====Paige Matthews====<br/>+<br/>+[[Image:01rose.jpg|thumb|right|Rose McGowan as Paige Matthews]]<br/>+[[Paige Matthews]]: portrayed by [[Rose McGowan]] (2001-present)<br/>+<br/>+Patty, the girls' mother, had an affair and had sex with her [[Whitelighter]] , Sam and gave birth to Paige  Matthews. However, this had to be kept secret so Sam and Patty took her to a church. There, Paige was given to the Matthews. Piper found Paige when she cast a spell to find a "lost witch". She attended Prue's funeral and reunited the Charmed Ones. Since Paige is half-witch/half-whitelighter, she is equipped with numerous powers. She has the ability to [[orb (Charmed)|orb]] and telekinetic orbing, calling for objects. She can also sense and "glamour," which is the ability to change one's image. Ske lately received to power to heal, because of her half-whitelighter side.<br/>+<br/>+She was a social worker in Season 4, when many troubles occurred. When she first met Piper and Phoebe, she was attacked by the demon Shax who had killed Prue. She helped vanquish Shax, her first demon vanquished and became a Charmed One. In Season 5, she decided to take a year off to pursue her destiny of being a witch. Paige was seriously romantically involved with fellow witch Richard Montana during her temp job in Season 6. The job was a magical one, with a feud between two families, escalating to cause many deaths. Richard Montana left because he went crazy with the use of magic. During Season 7, the Avatars came, and the late Agent Kyle Brody fell in love with Paige while he searched for them, mistakenly believing that the Avatars had killed his parents. He and an Avatar killed each other. He became a whitelighter, but not Paige's. Paige became headmistress of the Magic School when the position was vacated by Gideon, an Elder who, in his attempts to get rid of what he thought was a too-powerful baby Wyatt, was responsible for nearly turning him evil. Paige quit Magic School eventually, to concentrate on her Charmed duties and to help her newly-assigned Whitelighter charges.<br/>+<br/>+===Supporting cast===<br/>+====Leo Wyatt====<br/>+<br/>+[[Image:briank1.jpg|thumb|right|Brian Krause as Leo Wyatt]]<br/>+[[Leo Wyatt]]: portrayed by [[Brian Krause]] (1998-2005); was a recurring character during season one and half of season two.<br/>+<br/>+'''Birthday:''' 6 May 1924 <br/>+<br/>+'''Died:''' 14 November 1942 <br/>+<br/>+At first, Leo worked surreptitiously at [[The Manor]] as a handyman. He was a WW II army medic when he was young and mortal. When he was killed in battle, he was transformed into a whitelighter (whitelighters are like witches' guardian angels, and they have the capacity to heal their witch charges, and humans). Now, he's Piper's husband and the Charmed Ones' whitelighter. Leo helps the sisters to kill the demons and can heal the sisters if needed. Leo and Piper are the parents of Wyatt and Chris. After a crisis in which the Elders were under attack by the Greek Titans, Leo rose to the status of Elder, increasing his power greatly, including (this was not revealed until the end of Season 6) the ability to throw lightning, which every Elder seems to possess. Chris sent him to Valhalla, home to the Valkyries of Norse Mythology where Piper and the sisters saved him. Eventually, he joined the Avatars in order to save the sisters from dying by creating a demon-free world, but this backfired. He then (in Season 7) 'fell from grace' and is now a mortal, after having to choose between being an Elder and his family.  In Season 8 Leo has been 'frozen' due to a mysterious turn of the Halliwell sisters' fate. In fact, Brian Krause's appearances in the series have been limited to the first 10 episodes of the season for budgetary reasons; the show's executive producer, Brad Kern, has stated that Leo's character will return if more money becomes available for production. <br/>+<br/>+[[Image:DorianGregory.jpg|thumb|Dorian Gregory as Darryl Morris]]<br/>+<br/>+====Darryl Morris====<br/>+'''Darryl Morris''': portrayed by [[Dorian Gregory]] (1998-2005) <br/>+<br/>+A lieutenant (promoted from inspector) in the [[San Francisco]] [[Police|Police Department]], he was once the partner of inspector Andy Trudeau. Darryl has a wife and two sons. Since finding out the sisters' secret, he has been of great help to them by covering up unsolved cases related to demonic activity. Recently, however, he fell out with them over the risks he takes. Darryl killed a mortal killer when he was possessed by a phantasm, but was spied on by Detective Sheridan. The Cleaners had made other people believe that he killed a person on purpose, and got him sent to death row. As Darryl was about to be executed, the Charmed Ones were able to stop Darryl from being killed, and make him believe that it was all a dream.  Darryl has now stopped helping and covering for the Charmed Ones, as he had arrested Chris for stealing a car while trying to catch a demon. As of Season 8, [[Dorian Gregory]] has been dropped from the cast of Charmed due to budget cuts in the series. To facilitate his abscence, the character of Darryl was transferred to the East Coast, where contact with the sisters is non-regular and not onscreen.<br/>+<br/>+====Cole Turner====<br/>+<br/>+<br/>+[[Image:Julian_McMahon_02.jpg|thumb|right|Julian McMahon as Cole Turner]]<br/>+'''[[Cole Turner]]''' - '''[[Belthazor]]''': portrayed by [[Julian McMahon]] (2000-2003)<br/>+<br/>+Cole Turner was first sent by the Triad, who worked for the Source of all evil, to kill the Charmed Ones. Back then, he had an evil half known as the infamous demon 'Belthazor.' He fell in love with Phoebe, and instead of killing the Charmed Ones, he attempted to murder the Triad (which is called into doubt in season 8). In doing so, he betrayed the Source and turned his back on his own kind and all evil. After a while, the Charmed Ones discovered that he was Belthazor. Prue and Piper wanted to vanquish him, but Phoebe was unable to, having fallen in love with him. She helped Cole fake his own death and he was able to escape. Phoebe lied to everyone, saying that she had vanquished Belthazor/Cole. Even the Underworld believed that he was dead. Eventually, Phoebe admitted to her sisters that she had let Cole go. Cole reappeared, initially infuriating Phoebe, who still loved him but would not allow herself to do so. However, after Cole helped prevent Prue from getting married to a warlock, and after helping Prue save Phoebe's life, he managed to convince the sisters that he had turned away from evil. Cole then continued to assist the Charmed Ones, proving to be a powerful ally. He even managed to weaken the Source significantly during a battle to save Piper's life. After his evil half was accidentally vanquished, he became mortal, and continued helping the sisters with his knowledge of demons. He then took in the power of the Hollow, an energy which consumes magic, and aided the sisters in killing the Source of all evil. He released the Hollow and put it back in its place. He was then possessed by the living evil spirit of the Source and became evil, but he never lost his love for Phoebe, who eventually became pregnant with the spawn of the Source. She turned evil, married Cole, and became the Queen of the Underworld. Later, she kissed Cole goodbye and helped her sisters vanquish him as the Source. Cole was gone, but soon came back with his new powers. Phoebe hated Cole after that and he went crazy and tried to kill himself, but learned that he couldn't because he was invincible. Cole received more powers from an Avatar and tried to undo the past so that he could be with Phoebe again, but Paige figured out Cole's plan. Cole wasn't invincible in that time; he was Belthazor, so the Charmed Ones were able to vanquish him once and for all. He was thought to be gone permanently, but he returned in spectral form during Season 7 to advise Piper and he also made sure that Phoebe didn't give up on love.  Julian McMahon (the actor who played Cole) originally auditoned for the role of Inspector Andy Trudeau.<br/>+<br/>+====Andy Trudeau====<br/>+<br/>+[[Image:TedKing.jpg|thumb|right|Ted King as Andy Trudeau]]<br/>+'''Andy Trudeau''': portrayed by [[Ted King]] (1998-1999)<br/>+<br/>+Andy Trudeau grew up next-door to the Halliwell sisters in San Francisco. As a child he was close to them all, but in high school he dated [[Prudence Halliwell|Prue]] for a short period. Later when they parted ways and he moved out of his childhood home, Andy worked as an Inspector for the San Francisco Police Department and was coincidentally assigned to almost every police case that involved the Halliwell sisters. He worked with Darryl Morris as his partner. When the Halliwell sisters reunited and moved back into the Manor after their [[Penelope Halliwell|Grams]]' death, Prue bumped into him at a hospital. The two of them began dating shortly thereafter. He was in love with Prue, but they eventually broke up because Prue wouldn't tell Andy her secret. Eventually, Andy discovered that all three sisters were witches, and that they were responsible for saving many people's lives. He then risked his career to help them, ultimately sacrificing his life to protect them from the demon Rodriguez. Brian Krause (the actor who plays Leo) originally auditioned to play this character.<br/>+<br/>+====Dan and Jenny Gordon====<br/>+<br/>+[[Image:GregVaughan.jpg|thumb|right|Greg Vaughan as Dan Gordon]]<br/>+'''Dan Gordon''': portrayed by [[Greg Vaughan]] (1999-2000)<br/>+<br/>+The mortal next-door neighbor who was attracted to Piper Halliwell. He and his niece Jenny lived next door to the Halliwell Sisters. He used to play third base for the [[Seattle Mariners]] baseball team until he blew out his knee sliding home, then worked in construction. While Dan never discovered the sisters' secret, he noticed the oddity of the girls' lives and often suspected that they were hiding something. When Piper felt attracted to Dan, she decided to date him instead of Leo because the relationship seemed much less complicated. However, Piper's sudden disappearances and avoidance of his questions drove Dan crazy and made him feel insecure in their relationship.  He also always felt threatened by Leo, because even though Piper did not see him often, he knew that they had been serious and that Piper still cared for him. Dan felt as though he was simply "geographically desirable" and that that was the basis of the entire relationship. Piper finally broke up with Dan after she realized that despite loving Dan, she loved Leo more. Dan also became very suspicious of Leo and even asked his brother-in-law who worked for the state department to check Leo's army records. When his brother-in-law discovered that Leo had been a soldier in World War II and had died in the war, Dan presented the information to Leo and finally to Piper. Dan moved away to Portland when he was offered a job there, deciding that it was time for him to get on with his life.<br/>+<br/>+<br/>+<br/>+[[Image:Kpb3.jpg|thumb|right|Karis Paige Bryant as Jenny Gordon]]<br/>+'''Jenny Gordon''': portrayed by [[Karis Paige Bryant]] (1999)<br/>+<br/>+Jenny is the niece of Dan Gordon and next-door neighbor, and friend, of the Halliwell Sisters. Her parents were busy re-locating to a new home for their work and asked Dan to care for her until they were settled in. She was known to come to them for female advice when she was too embarrassed to talk to Dan. She only appeared in few episodes, and in the end, she did not serve any major purpose in any of the plotlines. She was then written to live with her parents again.<br/>+<br/>+====Wyatt Matthew Halliwell====<br/>+[[Image:4641.jpg|thumb|Jason & Kristopher Simmons as Wyatt Halliwell]]<br/>+[[Wyatt Halliwell]]: portrayed by [[Jason & Kristopher Simmons]] (2003- ) <br/>+<br/>+Until the day he was born, in the middle of season 5, Wyatt was constantly surprising his parents, Piper and Leo. Piper found out she was pregnant after being told by her doctor that she would have trouble conceiving due to extensive scar tissue on her uterus. Throughout Piper’s pregnancy, Wyatt exhibited many powers, making his mother "invincible". He was able to heal her from the womb, as well as protect her with a force field (Which he now uses to protect himself). His birth was prophesied centuries before, and he was called the “twice-blessed” child, but for the entire pregnancy, the girls and Leo thought that he was going to be a girl to be named “Prudence Melinda”. Everyone was surprised that he was a boy since everyone assumed he was Melinda, the daughter Piper met when she went to the future, in the beginning of season 2. Wyatt was given the middle name of Matthew in honor of his “super protective aunt Paige” and his first name is Leo’s last name. He shares the last name Halliwell, with his mommy and aunts because “evil fears it and good magic respects it.” Wyatt is an extremely powerful child and orbed for the first time when he was a couple of months old. He conjured a Dragon from a television when he was 8 months, and scared away Piper’s potential dates with magic at the tender age of 10 months. Wyatt could already heal at the age of 2 years old (something his little brother Chris was still not able to do at the age of 22). He could TK orb ever since he was a few-months-old and is the future master of Excalibur.<br/>+<br/>+====Christopher Perry Halliwell====<br/>+[[Image:ChrisPerry.jpg|thumb|Drew Fuller as Christopher Halliwell]]<br/>+[[Chris Halliwell]]: portrayed by [[Drew Fuller]] (2003-2004) <br/>+<br/>+Introduced as a moody and mysterious [[whitelighter]] from the future, Chris became the sisters' new whitelighter after Leo became an Elder. But he clearly wasn't like other whitelighters: he could orb and sense his charges, but he couldn't heal. He eventually confessed that he was a half-witch, which explained why he couldn't be frozen and had telekinetic powers. But it still took a while for Leo and the sisters to fully trust Chris since his actions were often shady and he was so focused on killing demons. Eventually, everyone learned that Chris was Leo and Piper's second son, and that he was named after Leo's father. He had come back to identify and vanquish the one responsible for turning his brother Wyatt evil; he was able to achieve this with the help of his family. Chris resented Leo for not being there for him in the future, but eventually reconciled with his father. He also didn't want to get emotionaly involved with his mother because she died when he turned 14, so he thought it would be too much pain to go back to a future where she was not alive, but after a talk with his grandfather Victor he decided to let it go and got close to Piper. The adult Chris was mortally wounded by Gideon while trying to protect infant Wyatt; he died in Leo's arms hours before Piper gave birth to his baby-self. Fortunately, Chris had set in motion a new future for himself and his family that may ultimately change his own destiny for the better.<br/>+<br/>+====Billie Jenkins====<br/>+[[Image:Cuoconut.jpg |thumb|right|Kaley Cuoco as Billie Jenkins]] <br/>+Billie Jenkins was introduced, in the show's eighth season, as a young witch who pays more attention to demon fighting than to her education. Billie was put under the tutelage of the Charmed Ones after she asked them to teach her everything they know about witchcraft. This, at the time when the Charmed Ones were thought to be dead, proved useful for the three sisters, as Billie could carry out smaller magic-related tasks and also to cover for them.<br/>+<br/>+Billie's backstory involves the abduction of her sister, Christie, by mysterious demons with unknown intentions. This -- along with the fact that the incident was never mentioned by her parents, leaving Billie even more confused -- was the main motivation for Billie to train and become skilled in using her powers. Her main objective, as this mystery remains to be solved, is to find out who kidnapped Christy and why, and to save her if she is still alive. Upon meeting with an Angel of Destiny, Billie was assured that her sister is alive and she will eventually find her. Spoilers indicate that her sister was kidnapped by a suprisingly alive Triad because she is the key to "ultimate power".<br/>+<br/>+Billie has the power of telekinesis, and she can use it to amplify her acrobatic abilities. She is cocky in her own powers and skills, but is still bested in a fight by Paige. Recently she received the power of projection. This power, yet to be defined in detail, projects Billie's thoughts into reality, and is triggered by strong emotions.<br/>+Billie inherited her powers from her grandmother on her mother's side. Her mother and father, however, are perfectly normal human beings, thus witchcraft skipped a generation in her family.<br/>+<br/>+==Continuity issues==<br/>+A subject of much dissapointment to certain sector of fans in the show's continuity issues, with specific details or "rules" often being contradicted in following episodes.

Based on a design already used for the [[Denver and Rio Grande]], it was much less decorative than the [[Rogers K class]] that had immediately preceded it, utilised a wheel arrangement of [[2-8-0]], and although it was very powerful for its day, it was typically limited to a speed of 29 km/h (18 mph).  This meant that it was usually assigned to freight trains and was generally seen working on the [[Otago Central Railway]] and steeper parts of the [[Main South Line]] such as the route between [[Dunedin]] and [[Oamaru]].  The class was introduced in early [[1880]] after being ordered in [[1879]], and around the beginning of the [[20th century]], the class received new [[boilers]] and two were moved north to [[Auckland]] to assist on the new [[North Island Main Trunk]].  As time progressed, the T class progressively lost work to more powerful, newer locomotives, and ended their days shunting major yards.  None survived to be preserved and all members of the class were scrapped.  The first two, T 101 and T 104, were withdrawn in March [[1922]], and the other four followed in March [[1928]].<br/>+She became a star overnight following the international success of the social drama ''[[Secrets & Lies]]'' in 1996, becoming the very first black English actress nominated for an [[Academy Award|Oscar]].

His father was John Joseph Chadwick and his mother was Mary Anne Knowles.<br/>+<br/>+In [[1914]] Chadwick went to study under [[Hans Geiger]] at the ''Technische Hochschule'' in [[Berlin]] (today the [[Technical University of Berlin]]). During the [[World War I|First World War]] Chadwick was interned in [[Germany]] as an enemy alien. <br/>+<br/>+==Research at Cambridge==<br/>+<br/>+After the war Chadwick returned to Cambridge where he worked with [[Ernest Rutherford]] in investigating the emission of gamma rays from [[radioactive]] materials. They also studied the [[transmutation]] of elements by bombarding them with [[alpha particle]]s, and investigated the nature of the [[atomic nucleus]].<br/>+<br/>+In [[1932]] Chadwick made a fundamental discovery in the domain of [[nuclear science]]: he discovered the particle in the nucleus of an atom that became known as the [[neutron]] because it has no electric charge. In contrast with the helium nuclei (alpha particles) which are positively charged, and therefore repelled by the considerable electrical forces present in the nuclei of [[heavy atom]]s, this new tool in [[atomic disintegration]] need not overcome any electric barrier and is capable of penetrating and splitting the nuclei of even the heaviest elements. In this way, Chadwick prepared the way towards the [[fission]] of [[uranium 235]] and towards the creation of the [[atomic bomb]]. For this epochal discovery he was awarded the [[Hughes Medal]] of the [[Royal Society]] in 1932, and subsequently the [[Nobel Prize for Physics]] in 1935. Later, he found out that a German scientist had discovered the neutron at the same time. But [[Hans Falkenhagen]] (Rostock) was afraid of publishing his results. When Chadwick learned of Falkenhagen's discovery, he offered to share the Nobel Prize with him. Falkenhagen, however, modestly refused the honour.<br/>+<br/>+==Liverpool==<br/>+Chadwick became professor of Physics at [[Liverpool University]] in [[1935]].  As a result of the [[Frisch-Peierls memorandum]] in [[1940]] on the feasibility of an [[atomic bomb]], he was appointed to the [[MAUD Committee]] that investigated the matter further. He visited North America as part of the [[Tizard Mission]] in [[1940]] to collaborate with the Americans and Canadians on nuclear research. Returning to England in November 1940, he concluded that nothing would emerge from this research until after the war. In December 1940 [[Franz Simon]], who had been commissioned by MAUD, reported that it was possible to separate the [[isotope]] [[uranium-235]]. Simon's report included cost estimates and technical specifications for a large [[uranium enrichment]] plant.

The lighted surface needs to be translucent.<br/>+==Life cycle==<br/>+''Anisakis'' spp. have a complex [[biological life cycle|life cycle]] which passes through a number of hosts through the course of its life. Eggs hatch in sea water and [[larvae]] are eaten by crustaceans, usually [[Krill|Euphausids]]. The infected crustacean is eaten by a fish or squid. The nematode burrows into the wall of the [[gut]] and [[cyst|encysts]] in a protective coat, usually on the outside of the [[viscera]]l organs, but occasionally in the [[muscle]] or beneath the [[skin]]. The life cycle is completed when an infected fish is eaten by a marine mammal, such as a [[whale]] or [[dolphin]]. The nematode excysts in the intestine, feeds, grows, mates and releases eggs into the sea water in the hosts [[feces]]. As the gut of a marine mammal is functionally very similar to that of a human, ''Anisakis'' spp. are able to infect humans who eat raw or undercooked fish.<br/>+The [[biodiversity|diversity]] of the genus has increased greatly over the past 20 years, with the advent of modern [[gene]]tic techniques in [[scientific_classification|species identification]]. It has been discovered that each final host species is home to its own biochemically and genetically identifiable ''sibling species'' of ''Anisakis''spp., which is reproductively isolated. This finding has allowed the proportion of different sibling species in a fish to be used as an indicator of [[population]] identity in fish stocks.<br/> <br/>-{{psych-stub}}<br/>+==Morphology==<br/>+[[image:So4b-08.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A scanning electron micrograph of the mouthparts of ''Anisakis simplex'']]<br/>+Anisakids share the common features of all nematodes; the [[vermiform]] body plan, round in [[cross section]] and a lack of [[segmentation (biology)|segmentation]]. The body cavity is reduced to a narrow [[body cavity| pseudocoel]].

In the stage which infects fish, ''Anisakis'' are found in a distinctive ''watch-spring coil'' shape. They are roughly 2cm long when uncoiled. When in the final host, Anisakids are longer, thicker and more sturdy, to deal with the hazardous environment of a mammalian gut.<br/>+[[Image:Anisakids.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Anisakid larvae in the body cavity of a herring (''Clupea harengus'')]]<br/>+<br/>+==Health implications==<br/>+Anisakids pose a risk to human health in two ways: through infection with worms from the eating of under-processed fish, and through allergic reactions to chemicals left by the worms in fish flesh.<br/>+<br/>+===Anisakiasis===<br/>+<br/>+Anisakiasis is the disease caused by infection with Anisakis worms. It is frequently reported in areas of the world where fish is consumed raw, lightly pickled or salted.  The areas of highest prevalence are [[Scandinavia]] (from [[cod]] [[livers]]), [[Japan]] (after eating [[sushi]] and [[sashimi]]), the [[Netherlands]] (by eating infected fermented herrings (''Maatjes'')), and along the [[Pacific]] coast of [[South America]] (from eating [[ceviche]]). Heating to 60°C, or freezing to below -20°C is an effective method of killing Anisakids.<br/>+<br/>+Within hours after ingestion of infected [[larvae]], violent abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting may occur.  Occasionally the larvae are coughed up.  If the larvae pass into the bowel, a severe [[eosinophilic]] [[granulomatous]] response may also occur 1 to 2 weeks following infection, causing symptoms mimicking [[Crohn's disease]].<br/>+<br/>+Diagnosis can be made by gastroscopic examination during which the 2 cm larvae are visualized and removed, or by histopathologic examination of tissue removed at biopsy or during surgery.<br/>+<br/>+===Allergic reactions===<br/>+Even when throroughly cooked ''Anisakis'' pose a health risk to humans. Anisakids (and related species such as the sealworm, ''Pseudoterranova'' spp., and the codworm ''Hysterothylacium aduncum'') release a number of [[biochemical]]s into the surrounding tissues when they infect a fish. They are also often consumed whole, accidentally, inside a fillet of fish.<br/>+<br/>+People who are sensitized to nematodes can have severe [[anaphylactic]] reactions after eating fish which have been infected with ''Anisakis'' spp. This is often confused with a fish or shellfish allergy, as the allergenic components of Anisakids are difficult to test for and are often produce a reaction in tests for other allergens.<br/>+<br/>+==Treatment==<br/>+For the worm, humans are a dead-end host.  Anisakis and Pseudoterra larvae cannot survive in humans and eventually die.  Treatment therefore in the vast majority of cases is symptomatic, with a heavy dose of re-assurance.  The only indication for treatment is small bowel obstruction due to Anisakis larvae, which may require emergency surgery, although there are case reports of treatment with [[albendazole]] alone (avoiding surgery) being successful (Pacios <i>et al.</i>, 2005).<br/>+<br/>+==Similar Parasites==<br/>+* Cod or Seal Worm ''Pseudoterranova (Phocanema, Terranova) decipiens ''<br/>+*''Contracaecum spp.''<br/>+*''Hysterothylacium (Thynnascaris) spp. ''<br/>+<br/>+<br/>+==References==<br/>+<br/>+# {{cite journal<br/>+ | author=Akbar A, Ghosh H<br/>+ | year=2005<br/>+ | title=Anisakiasis&mdash;a neglected diagnosis in the West<br/>+ | journal=Allergy<br/>+ | volume=37<br/>+ | issue=1 <br/>+ | pages=7&ndash;9}}<br/>+# {{cite journal<br/>+ | author=Lorenzo S, Iglesias R, Leiro J, Ubeira FM, Ansotegui I, Garcia M, Fernandez de Corres L<br/>+ | year=2000<br/>+ | title=Usefulness of currently available methods for the diagnosis of Anisakis simplex allergy<br/>+ | journal=Allergy<br/>+ | volume=55 <br/>+ | pages=627&ndash;33}} <br/>+# {{cite journal<br/>+ | author=Mattiucci S., Nascetti G., Tortini E., Ramadori L., Abaunza P. & Paggi L<br/>+ | year=2000<br/>+ | title=Composition and structure of metazoan parasitic communities of European hake (Merluccius merluccius) from Mediterranean and Atlantic waters: stock implications<br/>+ | journal=Parassitologia<br/>+ | volume=42 <br/>+ | issue=S1 <br/>+ | pages=176&ndash;186 <br/>+ }}<br/>+# {{cite journal<br/>+ | author=Orecchia P, Paggi L, Mattiucci S, Smith JW, Nascetti G & Bullini L<br/>+ | year=1986<br/>+ | title=Electrophoretic identification of larvae and adults of <i>Anisakis</i> (Ascaridida:Anisakidae)<br/>+ | journal=J Helminthol<br/>+ | volume=60 <br/>+ | issue=4 <br/>+ | pages=331&ndash;9 <br/>+ }}<br/>+# {{cite journal<br/>+| author=Pacios E, Arias-Diaz J, Zuloaga J, Gonzalez-Armengol J, Villarroel P, Balibrea JL<br/>+| year=2005<br/>+| title=Albendazole for the treatment of anisakiasis ileus<br/>+| journal=Clin Infect Dis<br/>+| volume=41<br/>+| pages=1825&ndash;6}}<br/>+<br/>+==External links==<br/>+*[http://www.dpd.cdc.gov/dpdx/HTML/Anisakiasis.htm CDC page on Anisakiasis]<br/>+<br/>+*[http://dave1.mgh.harvard.edu/ViewFilms.cfm?film_id=220 Endoscopy video of Anisakiasis]<br/>+<br/>+*[http://www.food-micro.nl/Pathogenen/parasiten/anisakis_simplex.htm HAACP analysis of risk of Anisakis infected foods]<br/>+<br/>+*[http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/172/3/329 Sushi, nemotodes and allergies in Canada]<br/>+<br/>+[[category:Parasites]]<br/>+<br/>+[[fr:Anisakis]]<br/>+[[ja:アニサキス]]</td>

He became a Greek citizen in 1913,  after Macedonia was liberated in the aftermath of the [[Second Balkan War]].  His father was Georgios Karamanlis, a teacher who fought during the national struggle of the Greeks in Macedonia, in [[1904]]-[[1908]]. After spending his childhood in Macedonia, he went to Athens to attain his degree in Law. He practiced law in Serres, entered politics with the conservative People's Party (''Laikon Komma'') and was elected Member of Parliament for the first time at the age of 28, in the last elections held before [[World War II]]. Due to health problems, Karamanlis did not participate in the [[Greco-Italian War]].<br/> <br/>-'''Dwight Yorke''' (born [[November 3]], [[1971]] in [[Canaan, Trinidad and Tobago|Canaan]], [[Tobago]]) is a [[Trinidad and Tobago]] [[football (soccer)|football]] player. He currently plays for [[Sydney FC]] in the [[Australia]]n [[A-League]]; he has previously played for the English clubs [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], and [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]]. <br/>+==First Premiership==<br/>+After World War II, Karamanlis quickly rose through the ranks of Greek politics. His rise was strongly supported by fellow party-member and close friend [[Lampros Eutaxias]] who served as [[Minister of Agriculture]] under the premiership of [[Konstantinos Tsaldaris]]. Karamanlis's first cabinet position was [[Minister of Employment]] in [[1947]] under the same administration. Karamanlis eventually become [[Minister of Public Works]] in the Greek Rally ''(Hellenikos Synagermos)'' administration under Prime Minister [[Alexander Papagos]]. He won the admiration of the U.S. Embassy for the efficiency with which he built road infrastructure and  administered American aid programs.<sup>[[#endnotes|1]]</sup><br/>+When Papagos died after a brief illness, U.S. Ambassador [[John Peurifoy]] counseled King [[Paul of Greece]] to appoint the young Karamanlis as Prime Mininster.<sup>[[#endnotes|2]]</sup> The King did so, thus bypassing [[Stephanos Stephanopoulos]] and [[Panagiotis Kanellopoulos]], the two senior Synagermos politicians who were widely considered as the heavyweights most likely to succeed Papagos.  Karamanlis first became prime minister in [[1955]], and reorganized the Greek Rally as the [[National Radical Union]] ''(Ethnike Rizospastike Enosis).'' He won solid majorities in three successive elections ([[1956]], [[1958]] and [[1961]]). In [[1959]] he announced a five-year plan (1960–64) for the Greek economy, emphasizing improvement of agricultural and industrial production, heavy investment on infrastructure and the promotion of tourism. On the international front, Karamanlis abandoned the government's previous strategic goal for [[enosis]] (the unification of [[Greece]] and [[Cyprus]]) in favor of Cyprus's independence. In 1958, his government engaged in negotiations with the [[U.K.]] and [[Turkey]], which culminated in the Zurich Agreement as a basis for a deal on the independence of [[Cyprus]]. In [[1959]] the plan was  ratified in London by [[Archbishop Makarios]].<br/> <br/>-===Trinidad & Tobago===<br/>-Yorke was capped 55 times for the [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago national team]], scoring 23 goals. He retired from international football in 2001 with his friend [[Russell Latapy]] after a fiasco with the coach, however he returned to the team for the [[Football World Cup 2006|2006 World Cup]] [[Football World Cup 2006 - North, Central American and Caribbean Qualification Groups|qualifying campaign]], in which the team qualified for the World Cup finals for the first time in their history after a 2-1 aggregate qualifying victory over [[Bahrain national football team|Bahrain]].<br/>+==The Merten affair==<br/>+[[Max Merten]] was ''Kriegverwaltungsrat'' (military administration counselor) of the Nazi occupation forces in Salonica. He was convicted in Greece as a war criminal in [[1959]], but was granted amnesty and released to the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] shortly thereafter. In September 28 [[1960]], German newspapers [[Hamburger Echo]] and [[Der Spiegel]] published exerpts of Merten's deposition to the German authorities according to which Karamanlis and Minister of the Interior [[Takos Makris]] were informers during the Nazi occupation of Greece. Merten claimed that Karamanlis and Makris were rewarded for their services with a business in [[Salonica]] which belonged to a Greek Jew sent to [[Auschwitz]]. Karamanlis rejected the accusations as unsubstantiated and absurd, presented evidence that Merten had tried to extort money from him prior to making his statements, and charged the opposition party for instigating them. The affair remained at the center of political discussions until early 1961, and resulted in tension between Karamanlis and King [[Paul of Greece]].<br/> <br/>-===Aston Villa===<br/>-Dwight Yorke was first discovered by [[Graham Taylor]], at the time the Aston Villa manager, on a tour of the West Indies in [[1989]]. He was signed by Taylor for approximately £120,000. Yorke made his Premiership debut for Aston Villa against Manchester United on [[December 29]], [[1990]] in which the game ended one-all. During his time with Aston Villa, from 1989 to 1998, Yorke was plagued with injuries that would halt Yorke from further progressing his career at the time. He was a right winger until the 1995-96 season, when he switched to centre forward and quickly established himself as one of the [[FA Premier League|Premiership's]] top strikers. Yorke was an integral member of the Villa team that reached the [[League Cup]] Final in 1996. Villa won 3-1 with Yorke getting on the scoresheet. On [[September 30]], [[1996]] he scored a brilliant hat-trick against Newcastle United in a 4-3 loss. Newcastle were leading 3-1 at half-time and Aston Villa were down to ten men, with [[Mark Draper]] being sent off late in the first half. Yorke showed great character in leading his team in a brave fight back by scoring two more goals in the second half to complete his hat-trick, although it was to no avail as Aston Villa still lost the game. Yorke scored a fourth goal to equalize the game at 4-all, only for his goal to be ruled offside. It was brilliant performances like this that earnt Yorke a £12.6 million transfer to Manchester United in [[August]] [[1998]]. Yorke appeared for [[Aston Villa]] on 231 occasions scoring 97 times. He is the 12th top goalscorer in the history of the club.<br/>+==Self-Exile==<br/>+During the elections of 29 October 1961, ERE won 50.80% of popular vote. On October 31, [[George Papandreou]] stated that the electoral results were due to widespread vote-rigging and fraud. Karamanlis replied electoral fraud, to the extent that it happened, was masterminded by the Palace. Political tension escalated, as Papandreou refused to recognize the Karamanlis government. On November 14, 1961 he waged a "unrelenting struggle" ("ανένδοτο αγώνα") against Karamanlis. <br/> <br/>-===Manchester United===<br/>-In his first three seasons, Yorke was a key player in guiding his club to three successive Premiership titles including a unique treble of the Premiership title, [[F.A. Cup]] and [[UEFA Champions League]], and at the same time forming a deadly attacking partnership with [[Andy Cole]].  Yorke was joint top scorer of the Premiership in the 1998–99 season. Yorke made 95 league appearances for Manchester United, scoring 47 goals. In 2001-02, Yorke lost his place in the line-up following the arrival of [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]]. It was also rumoured that Yorke had a fall-out with United boss, Sir Alex Ferguson, following his much publicised relationship with [[United Kingdom|British]] [[supermodel]] [[Jordan (model)|Jordan]]. The following summer he was sold to Blackburn Rovers for £2 million.<br/>+Tension between Karamanlis and the Palace escalated even further as Karamanlis vetoed fundraising initiatived undertaken by Queen [[Frederika of Hanover|Frederika]]. In July [[1963]], Karamanlis resigned the premiership after a disagreement with King [[Paul of Greece]], and spent four months abroad. In the meantime the country was in turmoil following the assassination of Dr. [[Gregoris Lambrakis]], a leftist member of Parliament, by right-wing extremists during a pro-peace demonstration in [[Thessaloniki]]. The opposition parties castigated Karamanlis as a moral accomplice to the assassination. In November the National Radical Union (ERE), under his leadership, was defeated by [[George Papandreou, senior|Georgios Papandreou]]'s ''Center Union'' party in the general election. Disappointed with the result, Karamanlis fled Greece under the name ''Triantafyllides''. He spent the next 11 years in self-imposed exile in [[Paris]], [[France]]. Karamanlis was succeeded by [[Panagiotis Kanellopoulos]] as the ERE leader.<br/> <br/>-===Blackburn Rovers===<br/>-Yorke spent two years at Blackburn Rovers, where he never made the same impact that he made at United, and subsequently joined Birmingham City in [[2004]] on a free transfer. There he fell out with manager Graeme Sounness, and it spilled onto the training pitch, where Souness, accusing him of not trying hard enough, hit him with a tackle that could have broken his leg. After that he was on his way out. Word is that despite the tackle, there is still a healthy respect between the two.<br/>+==Second Premiership==<br/>+Throughout his exile in France, Karamanlis was a vocal opponent of the [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974 | ''Régime of the Colonels'']], the military [[junta]] that seized power in Greece in [[April]] [[1967]]. After the fall of the dictatorship in [[July]] [[1974]] and backed by a huge wave of public support, Karamanlis returned to [[Athens]] on a French Presidency [[Lear Jet]] made available to him by President [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]], a close personal friend, and became the Prime Minister of a national unity government. <br/> <br/>-===Birmingham City===<br/>-He saw little action during the first part of the [[FA Premier League 2004-05|2004-05 season]], and made no appearances after January [[2005]]. Yorke was eventually released from his contract, and he signed with [[Sydney FC]] on [[17 April]].<br/>+Despite being faced with an inherently unstable and dangerous political situation, which forced him to sleep aboard a yacht watched over by a destroyer for several weeks after his return, Karamanlis moved swiftly to defuse the tension between [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]], which were on the brink of war over the [[Greco-Turkish_relations#The_1974_crisis_and_after|Cyprus]] crisis, and begin the steadfast process of transition from military rule to a pluralist democracy. <br/> <br/>-===Sydney FC===<br/>-By signing for [[Sydney FC]] Yorke opted to continue his career in Australia for less money than might have been available in some other leagues, notably those in the [[Middle East]] (a common destination for aging soccer stars seeking a lucrative final contract before retirement). He scored the first goal for Sydney in its first A-League regular season match, a spectacular diving header against the [[Melbourne Victory]]. Dwight Yorke came to Sydney FC with the biggest pedigree of all players in the new A-league, having won the treble with Manchester United. He has signed for Sydney for two years and has so far impressed with his vision and enormous experience. He has continued to score at Sydney with several goals under his belt so far, including one at the [[FIFA Club World Championship 2005]]. Dwight now resides in [[Elizabeth Bay]], in [[Sydney]]. Dwight Yorke has also been joined by other great players such as [[Kazuyoshi Miura]]. Dwight Yorke is getting along well with his [[coach]] [[Pierre Littbarski]]. Yorke's tantalising form, and crowd appeal has not gone unnoticed and he has been rewarded with the captain's arm-band. Yorke is regarded as the most important player the A-league has in it's ranks.<br/>+During this period, referred to as the ''metapolitefsi'' ([[Greek_(language)|Greek]]: Μεταπολίτευση), Karamanlis legitimized the [[Communist Party of Greece]] (KKE), adopted a measured approach to removing collaborators and appointees of the dictatorship, and, wanting to legitimize his authority, declared that elections would be held in [[November]] [[1974]], a mere four months after the collapse of the [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974 | ''Régime of the Colonels'']].<br/> <br/>-===Life Outside Football===<br/>-He was once in a much-publicised relationship with British supermodel [[Jordan (model)|Jordan]], and has a child with her called Harvey. Yorke disputed paternity until Jordan's claims were proven by a [[DNA test]].<br/>+In those elections, Karamanlis with his newly formed conservative party, ''[[New Democracy]]'' ([[Greek_(language)|Greek]]: Νέα Δημοκρατία, Nea Dhimokratia) obtained a massive parliamentary majority and was elected Prime Minister. The elections were soon followed by the [[1974]] [[plebiscite]] on the abolition of the [[monarchy]] and the establishment of the [[Hellenic Republic]], the televised [[1975]] trials of the former dictators (who received death penalties for high treason and mutiny that were mitigated to life incarceration) and the writing of the [[1975]] [[constitution]].<br/> <br/>-The [[Dwight Yorke Stadium]] in [[Bacolet]], Tobago, constructed for the 2001 [[Football U-17 World Championship|U-17 World Cup]], was named in Yorke's honour.<br/>+In [[1977]], ''[[New Democracy]]'' again won the elections, and Karamanlis continued to serve as Prime Minister until [[1980]], when he relinquished the Premiership and elevated himself to the [[Presidency]], following his signing of the [[EU_treaties#Accession_treaties|Accession Treaty]] with the [[European Economic Community]].<br/> <br/>-One of Yorke's closest friends is fellow Trinidadian [[Brian Lara]], who is currently the all time leading run scorer in [[test cricket|test match]] [[cricket]]. During the [[1999 Cricket World Cup]], Yorke made regular appearances bringing on drinks for the [[West Indies cricket team]].<br/>+==First and Second Presidency==<br/>+Karamanlis was elected President of the Republic by Parliament in [[1980]] and served until [[1985]]. He oversaw Greece's entry (1981) into the [[European Community]] (now the [[European Union]]).

For his long service to democracy and the European cause Karamanlis was awarded the [[Karlspreis]] in [[1978]]. He died after a short illness in 1998, at the age of 91.  He bequeathed his archives to the "Constantine Karamanlis Foundation", a conservative [[think tank]] he had founded and endowed.<br/>+ <br/>+His nephew [[Costas Caramanlis]] is now the leader of the New Democracy party, and Prime Minister as of March 7, 2004.<br/> <br/>-[[de:Dwight Yorke]]<br/>-[[fr:Dwight Yorke]]<br/>-[[ko:드와이트 요크]]<br/>-[[nl:Dwight Yorke]]<br/>-[[pl:Dwight Yorke]]<br/>-[[sr:Двајт Јорк]]<br/>+Karamanlis has been praised for presiding over an early period of fast economic growth for Greece (1957-61) and for supporting the membership of Greece with the emerging economic community of European nations that eventually became the [[European Union]]. His supporters came to laud him as the charismatic ''Ethnarches'' (National Leader). Some of his left-wing opponents have accused him of condoning of a "para-state" comprising rightist anti-communist groups, whose members undertook ''Via kai Notheia'' (Violence and Corruption), i.e., fraud during the electoral constests between ERE and Papandreou's ''Center Union'' party. Some of his conservative opponents have criticized his socialist economic policies during the [[1970s]], which included the nationalization of [[Olympic Airways]] and [[Emporiki Bank]]. Karamanlis has also been criticized for his management of the [[Cyprus]] crisis in [[1974]]. Most agree, however, that Karamanlis successfully orchestrated the transition from [[dictatorship]] to [[parliamentary democracy]] in [[1974]].<br/>+<br/>+==Endnotes==<br/>+<br/>+#Laurence Stern, ''The Wrong Horse,'' (1977) p.17.<br/>+#Ibid. p.17.<br/>+<br/>+<br/>+==See also==<br/>+<br/>+* [[List of Presidents of Greece]]<br/>+* [[Politics of Greece]]<br/>+* [[History of Modern Greece]]<br/>+<br/>+{{start box}}<br/>+{{succession box|title=[[Prime Minister of Greece]]|before=[[Alexandros Papagos]]|after=[[Konstantinos Georgakopoulos|Constantine Georgakopoulos]]|years=1955&ndash;1958}}<br/>+{{succession box|title=[[Prime Minister of Greece]]|before=[[Konstantinos Georgakopoulos|Constantine Georgakopoulos]]|after=[[Konstantinos Dovas|Constantine Dovas]]|years=1958&ndash;1961}}<br/>+{{succession box|title=[[Prime Minister of Greece]]|before=[[Konstantinos Dovas|Constantine Dovas]]|after=[[Panagiotis Pipinelis]]|years=1961&ndash;1963}}<br/>+{{succession box|title=[[Prime Minister of Greece]]|before=[[Adamantios Androutsopoulos]]|after=[[George Rallis]]|years=1974&ndash;1980}}<br/>+{{succession box|title=[[President of Greece]]|before=[[Konstantinos Tsatsos|Constantine Tsatsos]]|after=[[Christos Sartzetakis]]|years=1980&ndash;1985}}<br/>+{{succession box|title=[[President of Greece]]|before=[[Christos Sartzetakis]]|after=[[Kostis Stephanopoulos]]|years=1990&ndash;1995}}<br/>+{{end box}}<br/>+<br/>+[[Category:1907 births|Karamanlis, Constantine]]<br/>+[[Category:1998 deaths|Karamanlis, Constantine]]<br/>+[[Category:Prime Ministers of Greece|Karamanlis, Constantine]]<br/>+[[Category:Greek heads of state|Karamanlis, Constantine]]<br/>+[[Category:Greek politicians]]<br/>+[[Category:Macedonian politicians]]<br/>+<br/>+[[bg:Константинос Г.

It is located on the [[Manzanares]] river in the center of the country. Due to its geographical location and history, Madrid has been considered the [[finance|financial]] and political center of the [[Iberian Peninsula]].<br/>+Food historians have several theories regarding the name of this candy and its connection to [[Scotland]]; none of them conclusive. Some have documented that "buttery toffee" is often called butterscotch&mdash;[[Scotch]] being an old adjective for Scotland&mdash;which suggests it was invented in the country. However, the word was first recorded in [[Doncaster]], a [[Yorkshire]] town of [[England]], where Samuel Parkinson began making the candy in [[1817]]. Possibly the "scotch" part of its name derives from "[[wikt:scorch|scorch]]".<br/> <br/>-As the former capital of the old [[Spanish Empire]] Madrid has been bestowed with a degree of cultural predominance. Renowned museums such as [[Museo del Prado]], the [[Museo Reina Sofia]], and the [[Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza]] are major tourist attractions in the city. Other cultural highlights include the [[Royal Palace of Madrid]] and the nearby royal monastery of [[San Lorenzo de El Escorial]].  <br/>-<br/>-The estimated population of the city was 3.228 million (July 2005), while the estimated urban area population is 5.078 million. The entire population of the Madrid [[metropolitan area]] (urban area and suburbs) is calculated to be 5.843 million. The city spans a total of 607 km² (378 square miles).<br/>-<br/>-Following the restoration of democracy in 1975 and the integation to the [[European Union]], Madrid has experienced an increasing role in [[Europe|European finances]] making it one of the most important Southern European cities. The residents of Madrid are called ''madrileños'', and the current [[mayor]] is [[Alberto Ruiz-Gallardón]].<br/>-<br/>-==History==<br/>-[[Image:Karte Madrid MKL1888.png|300px|thumb|right|An [[1888]] German map of Madrid]]<br/>-{{main|History of Madrid}}<br/>-Although the site of modern-day Madrid has been occupied since prehistoric times, the first historical data from the city comes from the [[9th century]], when [[Mehmed I]] ordered the construction of a small [[palace]] in the same place that is today occupied by the [[Palacio Real]]. Around this palace a small [[citadel]], al-Mudaina, was built. <br/>-<br/>-[[Image:EdMetropolisMadrid.JPG|260px|thumb|right|The [[Metropolis building]] located on [[Gran Via]]]]<br/>-<br/>-[[Image:Madrid-cibeles.jpg|thumbnail|300px|right| Plaza de Cibeles (Cibeles square) and the Palacio de Comunicaciones (Communications Palace)]]<br/>-Near that palace was the [[Manzanares]], which the Muslims called {{unicode|al-Majrīṭ}} ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: المجريط, "source of water"). From this came the naming of the site as ''Majerit'', which was later rendered to the modern-day spelling of ''Madrid''). The citadel was conquered in [[1085]] by [[Alfonso VI of Castile]] in his advance towards [[Toledo]]. He reconsecrated the [[mosque]] as the [[church]] of the Virgin of Almudena (''almudin,'' the [[garrison|garrison's]] [[granary]]). In [[1329]], the [[Cortes Generales]] first assembled in the city to advise [[Ferdinand IV of Castile]]. [[Sephardic Jew]]s and [[Moor]]s continued to live in the city until they were expelled at the end of the 15th century.<br/>-<br/>-After troubles and a big fire, [[Henry III of Castile]] ([[1379]]-[[1406]]) rebuilt the city and established himself safely fortified outside its walls in El Pardo. The grand entry of [[Ferdinand and Isabella]] to Madrid heralded the end of strife between [[Castile]] and [[Aragon]].<br/>-<br/>-The kingdoms of [[Castilla]], with its capital at [[Toledo]], and [[Aragón]], with its capital at [[Barcelona]], were welded into modern Spain by [[Charles I of Spain]]. Though Charles favored Madrid, it was his son, [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] ([[1527]]-[[1598]]) who moved the court to Madrid in [[1561]]. Although he made no official declaration, the seat of the court was the ''de facto'' capital. [[Seville]] continued to control the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish Indies]], but Madrid controlled Seville. Aside from a brief period, 1601-1606, when [[Philip III of Spain|Felipe III]] installed his court in [[Valladolid]],  Madrid's fortunes have closely mirrored those of Spain. During the [[Siglo de Oro]] (Golden Century), in the 16th/17th century, Madrid had no resemblance with other European capitals: the population of the city was economically dependent on the business of the court itself.<br/>-<br/>-[[Philip V of Spain|Felipe V]] decided that a European capital could not stay in such a state, and new palaces (including the [[Palacio Real de Madrid]]) were built during his reign. However, it would not be until [[Carlos III of Spain|Carlos III]] ([[1716]]-[[1788]]) that Madrid would become a modern city. [[Carlos III of Spain|Carlos III]] was one of the most popular kings in the history of Madrid, and the saying "the best mayor, the king" became popular during those times. When [[Carlos IV of Spain|Carlos IV]] ([[1748]]-[[1819]]) became king the people of Madrid revolted. After the [[Mutiny of Aranjuez]] which was led by his own son [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Fernando VII]] against him, [[Carlos IV of Spain|Carlos IV]] resigned, but [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Fernando VII's]] reign would be short: in May of [[1808]] [[Napoleon]]'s troops entered the city. On [[May 2]], [[1808]] (Spanish: [[Dos de Mayo]]) the Madrilenes revolted against the French forces, whose brute reaction would have a lasting impact on French rule in Spain and France's image in Europe in general.<br/>-<br/>-After the war of independence ([[1814]]) [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Fernando VII]] came back to the throne, but after a liberal military revolution, [[Rafael del Riego|Colonel Riego]] made the king swear respect to the Constitution. This would start a period where liberal and conservative  government alternated, that would end with the enthronement of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabel II]] ([[1830]]-[[1904]]). She could not to calm down the political tension that would lead to yet another revolt, the [[First Spanish Republic]], and the comeback of the monarchs which eventually led to the [[Second Spanish Republic]] and the [[Spanish Civil War]]. During this war ([[1936]]-[[1939]]) Madrid was one of the most affected cities and its streets were battlezones. It was during the Civil War that Madrid had the sad honor of being the first city bombed by airplanes to spread terror among innocent citizens. <br/>-<br/>-During the [[dictatorship]] of [[Francisco Franco]], Madrid became very industrialized and there were massive [[migration]]s into the city. Towards the end of the dictatorship the Basque terrorist group [[ETA]] assassinated Franco's prime minister, [[Luis Carrero Blanco]], in the Street of Claudio Coello. Like anything related to [[ETA]], this incident is still today a matter of controversy; while some think that it created further instability, others hold that the terrorist action--by preventing Carrero Blanco from continuing the dictatorship after Franco's death--contributed to lead the country towards democracy. <br/>-<br/>-After the death of Franco, emerging democratic parties (including those of left-wing and republican ideology) accepted Franco's wishes of being succeeded by [[Juan Carlos I]]--in order to secure stablity and democracy--which led Spain to its current position as constitutional monarchy.<br/>-<br/>-Befitting from the prosperity it gained in the 1980s, the capital city of Spain has consolidated its position as the leading economic, cultural, industrial, educational, and technological center on the [[Iberian]] peninsula.<br/>-<br/>-==Contemporary Madrid==<br/>-[[Image:Madrid-Plaza de España.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Plaza de España-Spain Square]][[Image:Madrid-sol.jpg|thumbnail|300px|left|The Puerta del Sol square, the heart of the city]]<br/>-<br/>-Contemporary Madrid came into its own after the death of the [[Fascism|Fascist]] dictator [[Francisco Franco]]. Years of the Franco regime left Madrid and much the country in economic shambles due to isolation.  With his death, Madrid, and Spain as a whole, began to reassert itself on the international stage. Within Spain, reaction against the dictatorial bureaucracy centered in Madrid and a history of centralism that predated Franco by centuries has resulted in the successful modern movement towards increased [[autonomy]] for the regions of Spain, considered as autonomous regions, under the umbrella of Spain.<br/>-<br/>-Modern Madrid ranks as one of the important cities in Europe.  Madrid is a leading southern European city and the most important link between the [[European Union]] and [[Latin America]].<br/>-<br/>-The modern metropolis is home to over three million people. As expected with any major European capital city, each district (or [[barrio]] in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) has its own feel.<br/>-<br/>-===Plaza Mayor and Sol===<br/>-The Plaza Mayor is one of the most beautiful and emblematic urban areas in what is known as the Madrid of the House of Austria. It is located in the historical and commercial heart of the city. The Plaza is rectangular in shape and is surrounded by three-floored residential buildings. It has a total of nine entranceways. The Plaza Mayor was built during the Austrian period. Previously it was named the Plaza del Arrabal. The origins of the Plaza go back to 1581 when Felipe II told Juan de Herrera to devise a plan to remodel the busy and chaotic area of the old Plaza del Arrabal. Juan de Herrera was the architect who designed the first project in 1581 to remodel the old Plaza del Arrabal but the construction didn't start until 1617, during the Felipe III's reign. This king asked Juan Gomez de Mora to continue with the project, and he finished the porticoes in 1619. Nevertheless, the Plaza Mayor as we know it today is the work of the architect Juan de Villanueva who was entrusted with its reconstruction in 1790 after a spate of big fires. The Plaza Mayor has been the scene of multitudinous events: market, bullring and "actos de fe" against supposed heretics and the executions of those condemned to death. Under its porticoes there are some old and traditional shops. The statue of Felipe III on horseback in the centre of the square dates back to 1616. It is the work of Juan de Bolonia.<br/>-<br/>-===Opera===<br/>-As the name implies, Madrid's main Opera Theatre is the [[Teatro Real]] (Royal theatre). In front of the theatre is the Royal Palace. The Royal Palace is no longer used as a residence, but it has been kept intact since it last functioned as home to the King, primarily serving as a tourist attraction. The entire palace is not open to the public, but most of the more important rooms can be visited. The palace is interesting in its own right, in particular its architecture and gardens (there are two, the Jardines del Moro and the Sabattini gardens). There are also some excellent [[frescos]] inside the palace by Tiépolo, and paintings by [[Velázquez]], [[Goya]], [[Rubens]], [[El Greco]], [[Juan de Flandes]] and [[Caravaggio]], among others.<br/>-<br/>-===Alonso Martínez===<br/>-This district contains the large [[Plaza de Colón]]. This plaza commemorates [[Christopher Columbus]], who was responsible for ushering in the Spanish imperial golden age of the 16th and 17th centuries.  It is within walking distance of the main cultural and commercial areas of the city such as the [[Prado]] museum, the expansive [[Parque del Buen Retiro]] as well as near the business center on the lower part of the Paseo de la Castellana.<br/>-<br/>-===Atocha===<br/>-[[Image:Atocha1.jpg|thumbnail|300px|left|Façade of the old [[Atocha]] Railway station building]]<br/>-<br/>-Atocha includes a rather large area which is bordered by the Huertas and Lavapiés districts. The two important sites located in this area are the [[Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía|Reina Sofía Museum]] and the beautiful [[Atocha|Atocha Railway Station]], one of the two main train stations in Madrid (the other one is [[Chamartín]]). The area also contains a number of art galleries and restaurants serving traditional food.  This district also contains the main bus terminal as it is a central point of the city.<br/>-<br/>-===AZCA / Nuevos Ministerios===<br/>-[[Image:Madrid-TorrePicasso.jpg|thumbnail|200px|[[Torre Picasso]], in AZCA]]<br/>-<br/>-This is the financial district. The area is populated by skyscrapers, among them [[Torre Picasso]], [[Edificio BBVA]] and [[Torre Europa]]. [[Torre Windsor]], one of the skycrapers in this area, burnt entirely on the night between [[12 February]] and 13, 2005 [http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2005/graficos/feb/s3/windsorfotos.html].<br/>-A very large (3 interconnected buildings) [[El Corte Inglés]] department store is also here.<br/>-The area is directly linked to [[Barajas Airport]] by [[Madrid Metro|metro]] line 8 from ''Nuevos Ministerios'' station.<br/>-<br/>-===Chueca===<br/>-''Main article: [[Chueca]]''<br/>-<br/>-Chueca is among the most authentic and cosmopolitan neighborhoods in the downtown city center. This district was the site of major urban decay during the early 1980s.  However, later on during the decade it became one of the most active centers of the so-called '[[Movida|La Movida]]', largely due to its new-found status as a popular [[gay village]]. It is still quite attractive and has many good and interesting places to eat, as well as some of Madrid's most [[avant garde]] fashion and shoe shops.<br/>-<br/>-===Las Cortes===<br/>-This district is small in size but packs a number of powerful sites. The most important include Spanish parliament buildings of the lower house [[Spanish Congress of Deputies|Congreso de los Diputados]]. It also includes one of the three museums of the Madrid golden triangle, the [[Museo_Thyssen-Bornemisza|Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum]]. In addition, we find the highly ornate [[Banco de España]], the Café del Círculo de Bellas Artes, the Zarzuela theater.<br/>-<br/>-===Gran Vía===<br/>-As the name implies, the Gran Vía district contains one of Madrid's most important avenues, the Gran Vía (literally, "Great Way") First and foremost it is a shopping street, but it also contains  a number of tourist accommodations, plenty of nightlife and most of Madrid's largest movie theaters. It is also a hub for Madrid's red-light district, especially the side streets. One of those streets, [[Fuencarral]] has become a link between the old shopping areas of the center of the city, the Bohemian Malasaña and the hip Chueca, making of it one of the most cosmopolitan areas of the city.<br/>-<br/>-===Huertas-Lavapiés===<br/>-Traditionally one of the poorer neighborhoods near the city center, this district has maintained much of true 'Madrileño' spirit of the past. <br/>-Lavapiés is one of the areas with a high concentration of immigrants, and also tends to attract artists and writers adding to the cosmopolitan mix. The presence of immigrants has led to an inevitable variety of shops and restaurants - this is a good place for good and cheap restaurants of local and international food. It's also one of the best places to search for non-Spanish foodstuff, (herbs and spices etc.)  Due to its immigrant character and the fact that the terrorists responsible for the [[11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings|Madrid train bombings of 11 March 2004]], were based in Lavapiés (in particular, in a popular Moroccan restaurant called Al-Baraka), there are substantiated fears of crime in this district.<br/>-<br/>-===La Latina===<br/>-In and around this area are the origins of Madrid. Its difficult to put precise boundaries on La Latina, because, like its immediate neighbors, streets are narrow and wind a lot.  There are quite a few nightlife spots. There are also a number of attractive churches as well as Madrid's town palace. Bordering on La Latina's east side is the famous Rastro flea-market (a prime pick-pocket spot).<br/>-<br/>-===Malasaña===<br/>-Malasaña is a vibrant neighborhood full of lively bars and clubs overflowing with young people. Its streets are currently being renovated, making it a much more attractive quarter (the streetworks are almost finished). It's one of the classic areas for partying the night away. The area's center is the [[Plaza del Dos de Mayo]] (in commemoration of the Madrilenian popular uprising on [[May 2]], [[1808]], brutally and effectivey repressed by the French troops and which started the Spanish Independence War).<br/>-<br/>-Although popularly known as the [[barrio]] Malasaña, the<br/>-real name for the area is Universidad (University).<br/>-The name Malasaña comes from the 17 year old girl<br/>-Manuela Malasaña who once lived on the street<br/>-San Andrés. She was killed fighting the French in 1808.<br/>-Today there is a street named in her honour very close<br/>-to the roundabout 'Glorieta de Bilbao'.<br/>-<br/>-===Vallecas===<br/>-Vallecas is a working-class residential district in the south of Madrid.  It is also home to the [[Rayo Vallecano]] soccer team.<br/>-<br/>-==Demographics==<br/>-As the capital city of [[Spain]], the city has attracted many immigrants from around the world. While almost 9 in 10 inhabitants are [[Spain|Spanish]], there are many recent immigrants who come from [[Latin America]], [[Europe]], and [[North Africa]].<br/>-<br/>-The largest immigrant groups include: [[Ecuadorian]]: 83,967, [[Moroccan]]: 51,300, [[Colombian]]: 37,218, and [[Peruvian]]: 32.791. There are also important communities of [[Chinese]], [[Guinean]], [[Romanian]] and [[Filipino]] people.<br/>-<br/>-==Climate==<br/>-The region of Madrid has a [[Mediterranean climate]] that manifests itself with fresh winters that often experience temperatures lower than 8 °C. Summer tends to be warm with temperatures that easily reach 24 °C in July and that can often reach 35 °C. In fact, the daily oscillation of the weather conditions its quite reduced in the center of the city, but its far more noticeable in the outskirts of Madrid. [[Precipitation]], although very limited, can be observed all throughout the year except during summer.<br/>-<br/>-{| {{tablabonita}} align="center"<br/>-|+ <big>'''Parque del Retiro's Observatory</big><br/>-|- style="background:#efefef;"<br/>-! 1971-2000 !!

Younger ''madrileños'' sometimes dance all night, stop off for ''chocolate y [[churros]]'' at dawn, go home, shower, shave, and go to work. This nightlife, called ''[[la movida]]'' or la marcha and initially focussed on the [[Plaza del Dos de Mayo]], flourished after the death of [[Francisco Franco|Franco]], especially during the 80's while Madrid's mayor [[Enrique Tierno Galván]] was in office. A particular hub for this night activity is nowadays the gay district of Chueca. However, as prices continue to rise and more jobs become available, nightlife in Madrid is becoming more and more like that of other European cities such as Stockholm or Munich.<br/>-<br/>-==Universities==<br/>-<br/>-===Universidad Complutense de Madrid===<br/>-The Complutense University is one of the oldest universities in the world, and the largest  in Spain. It has 10000 staff and a student population of 117 000. It is located on two campuses, in the university quarter Ciudad Universitaria at Moncloa in Madrid, and in Somosaguas.<br/>-<br/>-The [[Universidad Complutense de Madrid|Complutense University]] has its origins in the 13th century on the banks of the river Henares. The university achieved the name "Complutense" due to the fact that it was originally situated in the town of [[Alcalá de Henares]], whose Latin name was ''Complutum''.  After 1836 the university was moved to Madrid and renamed ''Universidad Central''. The campus in the Ciudad Universitaria quarter in Madrid was built starting in 1927, and around 1980 a secondary campus was created in the neighbouring town of [[Somosaguas]]. The old Alcala campus reopened as an independent university ([[Universidad de Alcalá de Henares]]) in 1977.<br/>-<br/>-===Universidad Autonoma de Madrid===<br/>-The [[Autonomous University of Madrid|Autonoma]], perhaps Spain's best university for research along with Complutense, was instituted under the leadership of the famous physicist, [[Nicolás Cabrera]]. The Autonoma is widely recognised for its research strengths in theoretical physics. <br/>-<br/>-Known simply as ''la Autónoma'' in Madrid, its main site is the Cantoblanco Campus, situated 15 kilometers to the north of the capital (M-607) and close to the municipal areas of Madrid, namely Alcobendas, San Sebastián de los Reyes, Tres Cantos and Colmenar Viejo.<br/>-<br/>-Located on the main site are the Rectorate building and the Faculties of Science, Philosophy and Fine Arts, Law, Economic Science and Business Studies, Psychology, Higher School of Computing Science and Engineering, and the Faculty of Teacher Training and Education.<br/>-<br/>-The Medical School is sited outside the main site and beside the Hospital Universitario La Paz.

Given annual increases of 10%, a new fourth and fifth terminals are in the process of being constructed.  It is expected to significantly reduce delays and double the capacity of the airport.  Two additional runways have also being constructed and will soon be in operation, making Barajas a fully operational 4 runway airport.<br/>-<br/>-===National Rail===<br/>-Spain's railway system, the ''Red Nacional de Ferrocarriles Españoles'' ([[Renfe]]) operates the vast majority of Spain's railways.  In Madrid, the main rail terminals are [[Atocha]] and [[Chamartín]]. <br/>-<br/>-The crown jewel of Spain's next decade of infrastructure construction is the Spanish high speed rail network, Alta Velocidad Española [[AVE]].  Currently, an ambitious plan includes the construction of a 7,000 km network, centered on Madrid.  The overall goal is to have all important provincial cities be no more than 4 hours away from [[Madrid]], and no more than 6 hours away from [[Barcelona]].  As of 2005, [[AVE]] [[high-speed trains]] link Atocha station to [[Seville]] and [[Toledo]] in the south and [[Lleida]] in the east (to be extended to Barcelona).<br/>-<br/>-===Metro===<br/>-Serving the city's population of some three million, the [[Madrid Metro]] is one of the most extensive and fastest-growing [[metro]] networks in the world. With the addition of a loop serving suburbs to Madrid's south-west "Metrosur", it is now the second largest metro system in [[Western Europe]], second only to London's [[London Underground|Underground]]. The province of Madrid is also served by an extensive [[commuter rail]] network called [[Cercanías]].<br/>-<br/>-==Sports==<br/>-Madrid is home to [[Real Madrid]], the world's most successful [[football (soccer)|football]] club (according to [[FIFA]]). There are two other major teams, the Primera Division club [[Atlético de Madrid]] and [[Rayo Vallecano]].<br/>-<br/>-Madrid is also home to the [[Circuit del Jarama]], a [[motorsport]] race circuit which formerly hosted the [[Formula One]] [[Spanish Grand Prix]].<br/>-<br/>-==Theatres and Cultural Venues==<br/>-*[[Teatro Real]]: Madrid's main Opera House.<br/>-*[[Auditorio Nacional de Music]]: Was built in the 80s and houses two concert rooms for classical music.<br/>-*[[Teatro Monumental]]: The Orquesta Sinfonica de RTVE performs every Thursday and Friday in this old concert hall.<br/>-*[[Teatro de la Zarzuela]]This is one theatre you won't need Spanish for. It puts on the traditional Spanish operettas known as zarzuela, a kind of visual, bawdy comedy. It also programmes Opera and Lied.<br/>-*[[Centro Cultural de la Villa]] Worth visiting just to stroll under the deafening, refreshing waterfall located below the Columbus monument. It houses a theatre, concerts, a café and a huge gallery space, where group shows of many important Hispanic artists are staged.<br/>-*[[Teatro de la Abadía]]<br/>-*[[Círculo de Bellas Artes]] Compared to the ICA in London, or the Kitchen in New York, this great multi functional cultural and social centre, housed in its own fine building since 1926, is older and larger than both. A major player in the arts scene in Madrid, apart from a theatre and concert hall and vast café, it has four exhibition spaces that show work in all media.<br/>-*[[Teatro Español]]<br/>-*[[Teatro de la Comedia]]<br/>-*[[Cafe Central]] Madrid's top Jazz venue.<br/>-<br/>-==Madrid Nightlife==<br/>-Few cities in the world have the phrenetic activity you can find in Madrid any day of the year, any time round the clock. It's quite common to be in a traffic jam at 5AM any tuesday, wondering where the people is going, or if they have to work tomorrow.<br/>-<br/>-Central Madrid district is rammed with night clubs, discos, late restaurants, bars and pubs. 'street life' is also very popular due to the safety the city inspires to anyone who want to walk at night.<br/>-<br/>-=== How To Start ===<br/>-<br/>-So you want a little party, huh? The best start for this is to have a dinner out. Madrid has excellent restaurants where to set the bases for a big night out. Remember, Spaniards love to have dinner really late. A normal time for this would be 10PM on winters and even 11PM on summers. The dinning ceremony extends well until 1 AM, good time to have the "primera" (the first drink).<br/>-<br/>-In Chueca district you can find hundreds of trendy, but not neccessarily expensive, dinner restaurants. If "spanish tapas" is what you fancy, La Latina and C/Segovia districts have very interesting wineries specialized on tapas. La Latina is really famous on Sunday Mornings, but for a Saturday dinner is good as well.<br/>-<br/>-So let us recommend you for the beginning a night walk around Chueca or Latina area, until you find a restaurant that fancies you. They are relatively small and pedestrian areas so it is nice to walk around mixing with the locals.<br/>-<br/>-After the dinner it is a good idea to have a drink around, or head for other districts, depending on what you want.<br/>-<br/>-* '''Alonso Martinez''' is rammed with youngsters. All kinds of music here.<br/>-<br/>-* '''Avenida De Brasil''' and nearbies is for beautiful people. Nice pubs and clubs. Also nice restaurants. <br/>-<br/>-* '''Chueca''' is more headed towards trendy people. The pubs and clubs around host a mixed and open-minded clientele. The music heard is frequently cheesy house and commercial stuff.<br/>-<br/>-* '''Bilbao''' is also an option. This area has a little bit of everything: Bars, pubs, restaurants, clubs.<br/>-<br/>-* '''La Latina''' is frequented by artists. Hosts a big number of wineries and tapas bars. A must on sunday mornings.<br/>-<br/>-* '''Malasaña''' is the district for rock and roll, and independent music. Nice terraces on summer.<br/>-<br/>-=== Some places ===<br/>-<br/>-This list is by no means complete. It has a trendy and young flavour so it may not suit everybodies' tastes.

Michael's grandparents emigrated from [[Hungary]] to the [[USA]] after [[World War II]]. Michael was married to Samntha, but he lost her to a car crash shortly afterwards. He moved to Hungary after his got his medical degree and immersed himself fully into an internship at a hospital.<br/>-<br/>-''During the events of '''Underworld'''...''<br/>-<br/>-[[Image:Michaelcorvin2.JPG|left|thumb|Michael Corvin]]He was caught in the middle of a firefight between Vampire [[Death Dealers]] and [[Lycan]]s one night on his way to work. Unknown to him, he was targeted by the lycans for a hybrid experiment as his blood held a pure sample of the immortal strain. Later, he was assailed and thus infected by [[Lucian (Underworld)|Lucian]], leader of the lycans following [[William Corvinus]]' capture. The lycans, now aware that Michael is indeed the carrier of the pure immortal strain, went all-out to acquire him.<br/>-<br/>-Michael was protected by [[Selene (Underworld|Selene]], and he formed a romantic connection with her. Later, even though she protected him from a band of lycans, he was captured and brought to the lycan lair. After Death Dealers invaded the lair, Michael was shot lethal [[silver nitrate]] bullets by Selene's jealous lover, [[Kraven]]. In a bid to save him, she added her vampire virus to his bloodstream, and thus Michael became the first hybrid. [[Viktor (Underworld)|Viktor]], who condemned his daughter to death just to prevent such an occurence, fought Michael and his Elder strength almost killed him. However, thanks to Selene once more, the Vampire Elder was taken down.<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-''During the events of '''Underworld Evolution'''...''<br/>-<br/>-[[Image:Michaelcorvin.jpg|right|thumb|The Hybrid Michael]]Selene and Michael are on the run from both lycan and vampire alike. Michael has learnt to transform at will yet refuses to submit to the immortal habit of drinking blood for supplement. This almost caused him to injure policemen who were trying to apprehend him. After being saved by Selene, the duo confronted the last Vampire Elder, [[Marcus Corvinus (Underworld)|Marcus Corvinus]].<br/>-<br/>-After a narrow escape, Michael and Selene both shared a [[sexual intercourse|sexual experience]], a seeming indication at a sequel. They met with [[Andreas Tanis]], the Official Historian of the Covens, during which Michael put fresh fear into the cowardly vampire. They then went to the ''Sancta Helena'' afterwards, where Michael met with his ancestor, Alexander. Marcus' sudden intrusion and the battle that was fought caused Michael to be impaled and killed on a steel beam.<br/>-<br/>-Apparently, Michael had attained hybrid healing powers which resurrected him.

''King Dream'' showcases his politically charged piece '''Tax Dollar$ Kill''', circa 1998]]<br/>-The [[Philippines]] has the oldest [[hip hop music|hip hop]] scene in [[Southeast Asia]], largely due to that nation's historical connections with the [[United States]], the birthplace of hip hop. '''Filipino Rap''' is a non-homogeneous musical style that encompasses all [[hip-hop music]] that is done by [[Filipinos]] such as [[Tagalog]] rap, [[Chavacano]] rap and hip hop in [[Ilocano]]. The musical style has become as diverse as hip hop music itself with such sub-genres as [[Kalye]] (Street), [[Masa]] (Commercial), [[Makabayang]] (Nationalistic/Politically Concious), [[Gangsta]], and [[Underground]] rap. The Philippines is considered by many to have developed the first [[hip hop music|hip hop]] scene in all of [[Asia]] and the [[Pacific Islands]]. <br/>-<br/>-==History==<br/>-===Origins: The roots of hip hop in the Islands===<br/>-[[Image:megateampic.jpg|thumb|150px|right|DJ M.O.D. and The Megateam celebrate their win at '''DMC Philippines''']]<br/>-[[Image:BRP_Rockallparties_Crew2.jpg|thumb|275px|left|Las Piñas own '''Rock All Parties Crew''', circa 1983]]<br/>-The beginnings of [[hip hop culture]] in the Philippines can be attributed to several main factors; the innate of them being the heavy influx of American musical styles in that country as reflected in the widespread popularity during the [[1960]]s of [[Motown]] artists' [[The Temptations]], [[The Supremes]] and [[The Jackson Five]] and later in the [[1970]]s of [[Funk]], [[Soul]] and [[Disco]] music. Bands such as [[The Commodores]], [[The Gap Band]], [[James Brown]], [[Confunktion]], [[The Bar-Kays]] and [[Earth, Wind and Fire]] among many others received heavy rotation on Manila airwaves. The future importation of hip hop culture and music, similar to the previous genres mentioned can be credited to the direct contact Filipinos received with both [[Americans]] and [[Filipino Americans]], or as they are commonly called ''balikbayans'', stemming from the root words "balik" meaning to come back and "bayan" loosely translating into hometown or homeland. <br/>-<br/>-The intimate relationship between hip-hop culture and the large Filipino American community along the [[United States]] West Coast naturally resulted in the exportation of rap music back to the Philippines. Numerous cassette tapes, videos, books and magazines concerning hip hop issues and popular rap artists would be sent out by Filipinos to family members back in the islands. <br/>-<br/>-[[Image:rapcrewcard.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Early ad for mobile DJs, the '''R.A.P. Crew''']]<br/>-The towns and barrios surrounding the numerous American military bases that were scattared throughout that country such as Clark Air Force Base in Angeles City and Subic Naval Base in Olongopo were among the earliest to be exposed to the culture; as contact with [[African-American]], Filipino American and [[Latino]] servicemen resulted in some of the earliest exposure the locals had to the new musical genre. <br/>-<br/>-Groundbreaking hip hop films such as ''Wild Style'' (1983), ''Breakin'' (1984) and ''Krush Groove'' (1985) were also major influences; and as early as [[1982]] local breakdancing crews like ''The Eclipse'', ''Info-Clash Breakers'' and ''Ground Control'' (whose former members included Rapmaster Fordy, later to be known as Andrew E. and Jay '''Smooth''' MC of Bass Rhyme Posse) became mainstays in local parks and malls in and around Metro Manila such as '''Glorietta Mall''', which was an early hotspot for breakers. Several mobile DJ crews of the era included such names as the '''Rock All Parties Crew''' which emerged onto the scene only to produce such future Pinoy rap pioneers as Andrew E. and Norman B.<br/>-[[Image:Left francis m.jpg|thumb|150px|right|'''The foundation:''' The King of Pinoy Rap, Francis M.]]<br/>-<br/>-===1980s: Seeds of a movement, from the South Bronx to Metro Manila===<br/>-[[Image:ladydianepic.jpg|thumb|100px|left|'''The First Lady of Filipino Rap:''' Lady Diane was a pioneer in the early days of the genre]]<br/>-The birth of Filipino [[hip hop music]] (commonly called '''Pinoy Rap''') came in the early [[1980s]], with early records from '''Dyords Javier''' (''Na Onseng Delight'') and '''Vincent Dafalong''' (''Nunal''), both records released in [[1980]]. Early influences on the genre included American hip-hop icons ''Grandmaster Flash & the Furious Five'', ''The Sugarhill Gang'', ''Kurtis Blow'', ''RUN-DMC'', ''Ice-T'', ''KRS-ONE'' & ''Boogie Down Productions'' and ''Eric B. and Rakim'' among many others.<br/>-<br/>-The genre developed an underground following in [[Metro Manila]] during the 1980s. In late 1989, former DJ and breakdancer Andrew E., or, as he was then called, Rapmaster Fordy, introduced two of his friends from the mobile DJ group '''Rock All Parties Crew''', Norman B. and Andy "Luv" MD, to J "Smooth" MC, an acquaintance from Andrew's breakdancing days. The trio would go on to form the group '''Pine Rhyme''' (for ''Las Piñas City'', the area from which they hailed), later to be renamed the [[Bass Rhyme Posse]].  The pioneering act was Pinoy hip hop's first rap group and would release their self-titled debut album on Viva Records in 1991 which spawned the cult hits ''Let the Beat Flow'', ''Buhay Estudyante'' (Student Life) and ''Juan T.'' becoming the genre's first rap group to release a record.[http://www.geocities.com/bassrhymeposse/body_brp_facts.html]<br/>-<br/>-The genre soon entered the mainstream with [[Francis Magalona]]'s [[debut album]],  ''Yo!'', which included the nationalistic [[hit]] "Mga Kababayan" (My Countrymen).  The former breakdancer Francis Magalona (widely known by aliases ''Francis M., The Man from Manila'', ''Master Rapper''), who rapped in both English and [[Tagalog]], became a instant [[superstar]] and the first rap icon in the Philippines as a result.  <br/>-<br/>-More stars followed in Magalona's footsteps, including [[Pia Arroyo]] who's (''Loving You'') duet track with Francis M. marked the first time a female had rapped on record in the country, [[Lady Diane]] (''The First Lady of Rap''), [[Andrew E.

Early innovators of the style included DJs Carlo Yalo, Noel Macanaya, Rod "DVS" Torres and Omar Lacap among others. <br/>-<br/>-Following the path set forth by their [[Bass Rhyme Posse]] predecessors, the tri-lingual rap group [[Rapasia]] released their self-titled debut record in 1991, garnering the hit ''Hoy! Tsismosa''. One of the earliest Filipino hip hop groups to embrace such an abstract format, the album's lyrical content often contained a mixture of various Philippine dialects (including [[Tagalog]] and [[Chavacano]]) along with [[English language|English]]. Rapasia's innovative style would later be built upon years later by other Pinoy rap groups such as [[Zamboanga]]'s [[Ghost 13]]. Rapasia's members included Martin "Bronx" Magalona, brother of Pinoy rap entrepreneur Francis Magalona. <br/>-<br/>-The following year marked a turning point for Pinoy rap with the release of Francis M.'s second album, ''Rap Is Francis M'' (1992), which is highly regarded as one of the greatest [[Pinoy]] Rap albums. With tracks addressing the various cultural and social problems that plagued his country such as drug addiction in "Mga Praining" (The Addicts), political instability in "Halalan" (Election) and self hate in "Tayo'y Mga Pinoy" (We Are Filipinos), the record's complexity and conscious message quickly earned it its classic status and became the standard by which future albums of the genre were to be compared to. Magalona's enduring contributions to the genre would later be recognized in the U.S.-based hip hop publication ''The Source'' (May 2004). In [[1994]], going against the wave of radio-friendly rap tracks that dominated at the time,[[Image:maddpoets.jpg|thumb|100px|left|'''D-Coy''' of the influential group '''Madd Poets''']][[Death Threat (hip hop musician)|Death Threat]] released the first Filipino [[gangsta rap]] album which told tales of the daily lives and struggles impoverished Filipino youth faced growing up in the slums of Metro Manila's [[barrios]] entitled ''Gusto Kong Bumaet'' (I Want To Be Good). <br/>-<br/>-In 1997, the underground Pinoy rap group [[Pamilia Dimagiba]] released their groundbreaking album ''Broke-N-Unsigned'' on Tenement Records. A coalition of sorts, Pamilia Dimagiba composed itself of several underground Pinoy rappers and crews such as 8th Messenger, Shadowblyde, Spoon, Murder-1 of '''Khan's Assassins''' and Young Galaxy of '''Iron Triangle''' among others. The seven-track, politically-minded conscious album was a breath of fresh air at the time; as Pinoy rap during the era had taken a more hardcore, gangster persona. Records by the names of "Duelo", "Manila's Finest", "Reality Hurtz" and "Brainstorming" among others were largely in essence a throwback to the early, nationalistic Francis M. inspired days of the genre. <br/>-<br/>-Another Filipino hip hop artist who achieved prominence during the 1990s is the formerly Los Angeles-based DJ [[Andrew Espiritu|Andrew E.]] (Andrew Espiritu), whose tracks "Humanap Ka Ng Panget" and "Makati Girl" (as done by Norman B. of Bass Rhyme Posse; was the first Pinoy rap track recorded to contain beatboxing) became monster hits in the Philippines, rivaling even Francis M.'s previously untouchable reign on top Pinoy rap's throne. Prior to landing a recording contract, the rapper had competed in various rap contests around the Philippines; the likes of which also produced Pinoy rap stars Michael V., Denmark and Martin "Bronx" Magalona. Andrew E.'s 1991 hit "Humanap Ka Ng Pangit" (Look For Someone Ugly) was the first to spawn a plethora of response records from other rappers in the country, such as Michael V.'s ''Maganda Ang Piliin'' (Pick Someone Pretty). The rapper's ability to combine unique storytelling with raunchy and humorous wordplay laced with catchy beats made Andrew the first of his kind in the genre. He then went on to release a movie entitled '''Andrew Ford Medina: Huwag Kang Gamol''' in 1991 which was the first film in the Philippines to include a full-on freestyle battle on screen. By the mid-1990s he had established his own record label, Dongalo Wreckords, as well as successful rap groups, including [[Madd Poets]] and [[Bicolano]] rappers [[Salbakuta]]. The former, known for their complex and versatle lyrical ability achieved fame with their debut album ''Ikatlong Mundo''. In [[1997]], Andrew E. produced and hosted the first Pinoy rap television show, '''Rap 13'''. Other popular rap artists and groups included Cirkulo Pugantes, El Latino, Mastaplann, Verbal Sativa, Pamilia Dimagiba, Kulay, Legit Misfitz, Pariente, Sun Valley Crew, and Mega Force Crew (formerly known as Grand Assault Tribe).<br/>-<br/>-[[Image:krooknjolo.jpg|thumb|175px|right|'''The legacy continues:''' Krook & J.O.L.O. are among the many new artists representing Pinoy rap in the millennium]]<br/>-[[Image:normal 17bsides.jpg|thumb|150px|left|'''Batangas 2 Brooklyn:''' Mike Swift is one of Pinoy Rap's bright new stars]]<br/>-<br/>-===Millennium and beyond: The New School===<br/>-The first years of the 2000s witnessed Pinoy rap transform from being considered a novelty or fad into a full fledged phenomenon, eventually surpassing even [[Pinoy rock]]'s stronghold on popularity in the island nation.

In [[2002]], [[Carlo Maniquiz]] and [[Nick Tuason]] together with the assistance of '''FUBU''''s headquarters in [[New York City]] established '''FUBU Philippines''' clothing; opening up several chains of stores around the islands, and along with the King of Pinoy Rap himself Francis M., launched a compilation album of the same name later that year showcasing a basic who's who of local hip-hop talents. <br/>-<br/>-In [[2003]], [[Death Threat (hip hop musician)|Death Threat]] member [[Gloc 9]] released his solo debut album entitled ''G9'', scoring such hits as "Isang Araw", "Sikat Na Si Pepe" and "Jologs" among others; making his solo arrival known to the Philippine music industry the record was an instant hit.[[Image:gloc9pic.jpg|thumb|95px|left]] The album would be followed up by 2005's memoiric "Ako Si...Gloc 9", the rapid-tongued emcee's career has since been elevated to new heights and is considered to be one of the most acclaimed and popular rappers within the genre today.[http://www.philmusic.com/blog/index.php?p=144]<br/>-<br/>-February 19, [[2005]] served as a milestone for Philippine based Filipino rap as the first ever '''Philippine Hip-Hop Music Awards''' were held, paying tribute to the pioneers of the genre along with celebrating Pinoy rap's new school.

With tracks consisting of English lyrics such as ''On Your Own'' dominating the Philippine air waves, several Tagalog based emcees have felt a sort of bias in the Philippine music industry, favoring Pinoy hip hop artists who use English rather than MCs who choose to use Tagalog or other native [[Philippine languages]] in their rhymes. The conflict between the two sides became evident during an infamous event at a 2004 [[Black Eyed Peas]] concert in Manila in which local rapper Mike Swift's Tagalog-based track was cut short halfway through the song due to the unofficial "English Only" policy towards the BEP's opening acts being enforced by the event's organizers.[http://www.inq7.net/lif/2004/jun/12/lif_3-1.htm]<br/>-[[Image:skills.jpg|thumb|150px|left|B-Boy '''Skills''' at the 2005 Blazin' Freestyle Battle]]<br/>-[[Image:djkimozavepic.jpg|thumb|right|170px|The Spindicate Posse's '''DJ Kimozave''']]<br/>-<br/>-==Other elements of hip hop==<br/>-Other than the art of [[rapping|rap]], Filipino hip hop is also represented by other elements such as [[turntablism]], with DJs DJ Coki, DJ Kimozave, DJ Rocky Rock, DJ Arbie Won, and DJ Sir Scratch.

Filipino American hip hop culture bases its long historical roots beginning in the [[Filipino]], [[Latino]] and [[African-American]] neighborhoods along the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], specifically in the Oakland-San Francisco Bay Area and [[Los Angeles]]. The movement that had been born in the south Bronx among [[Jamaican]], [[Puerto Rican]] and [[African American]] youth in turn had its West Coast identity formed within the respective African American, Filipino and [[Mexican]] communities. Similar to the Filipino American [[zoot suit]]ers, be-boppers and ballroom dancers of previous generations, the dynamics within these respective communities would reincarnate itself once again in the form of hip hop. Since the 1990 Census, Filipino Americans have made up the second largest Asian Pacific American group in the United States (after Chinese Americans), and the largest Asian group in California.  In West Coast hip hop, their role has been comparable to that of [[Puerto Rican]] artists on the East Coast, who were an integral part, along with African Americans, in the creation of the foundations of hip hop culture. <br/>-<br/>-As early as the late 1970s, during [[hip hop music|hip hop]]'s infancy, pioneering [[Bay Area]] [[Filipino]] mobile [[DJ]] crews such as [[Electric Sounds]], [[Ladda Sounds]], [[Ultimate Creations]], [[Kicks Company]], [[Images]], [[Non-Stop Boogie]], [[The Legion of Boom]], and [[Sound Sequence]] among many others helped capitalize on the massive Filipino party scene and spread the popularity of the new genre of music in the surrounding areas through paid gigs on house/block parties, family gatherings, school pep rallies, weddings and church halls. Rival crews would often one-up each other by showcasing superior equipment and providing elaborate set-ups. Early mobile DJ stars included DJ Ren, (born Rene Anies) founder of one of the first Filipino-American DJ crews '''Electric Sounds'''. In 1983, a real-estate agent by the name of [[Mark Bradford]] established ''Imagine'', which began primarily as a showcase for Filipino DJ talent in and around the Bay Area and came to serve as the premier event for DJs until the founders untimely murder in 1991. The movement would reach its pinnacle in 1987, when more than one hundred mobile DJ crews would participate in all important DJ sound clashes and showcases. By the late 1980s, the '''mobile DJ''' movement had declined in popularity and had given way to the '''turntablist''', largely due to the rise of [[Q-bert (DJ)|Q-Bert]] and the innovation of ''scratching'' within the DJ community. The legacy of the '''mobile DJ''' would live on however; due to the fact that many of the Bay Area turntablists that would go on to define the art in the 1990s such as Q-Bert himself, along with DJ Shortkut often had their beginnings in mobile DJ work.[http://sfbg.com/noise/01-01/fili.html]<br/>-<br/>-Also in New York City, early hip hop musician and Salsa legend [[Joe Bataan]] (half Filipino and half African American) had one of the first rap hits, "Rap-O Clap-O," in [[1979]], released on his [[Salsoul Records|Salsoul]] label. In [[1980]], DJ [[Nasty Nes]] (of '''Rap Attack''' fame) of [[Seattle]] launched the specialty show "Freshtracks"  on [[Seattle]]'s 1250 KFOX introducing the first ever hip-hop radio station on the West Coast. He would than later go on to serve as the DJ for pioneering Seattle rapper [[Sir Mix-A-Lot]].<br/>-<br/>-[[Image:rockforcecrew.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The legendary '''Rock Force Crew''']][[Image:pikaso-portrait of a mastapiece.jpg|thumb|150px|right|The Bay Area's '''Mr. Sirate''' a.k.a.

Elsewhere in the Bay Area, pioneering Filipina rapper '''Lani Luv''' (born Melanie Caganot) became one of the early West Coast female MCs.  Several tagging crews such as Oakland's Those Damn Kids (TDK) were some of the originators of [[Graf Art]] on the West Coast. It was during this time that TDK's [[Michael Francisco]] (a.k.a. "King Dream") emerged out of the graf art world; now deceased, he is considered by many to have been one of the greatest and most influential graf writers who's work had focused on social issues concerning not only Filipino Americans, but also people of color in America such as police brutality, racism, nationwide liberation and rebellion. <br/>-[[Image:mikedreamoak.jpg|thumb|550px|center|Tribute mural for Mike "Dream" Francisco, Oakland, California, 2000]]<br/>-<br/>-===Rise of the turntablists: Built from scratch===<br/>-[[Image:Djq-bert.jpg|thumb|320px|right|DJ Q-Bert]]<br/>-[[Image:kuttin.jpg|thumb|100px|left|NYC's DJ Kuttin Kandi]]<br/>-By the 1990s, hip hop artists of [[Filipino]] descent (particularly [[turntablism|turntablists]] like [[Q-bert (DJ)|Q-Bert]] and the [[Invisibl Skratch Piklz]]) achieved prominence and came to dominate the DJ art form of scratching, introducing the world to a more innovative style of scratching utilizing a wide variety of new techniques, including the playing of actual melodies. {{ref|autonumber}} In 1996, the [[International Turntable Federation]], which hosts the largest international turntablist competitions, was established by Alex Aquino.

Its foreign ministry includes both the minister of foreign affairs and minister of international aid.<br/>-<br/>-==History==<br/>-<br/>-Norway's [[Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs|ministry of foreign affairs]] was established on the same day that Norway [[Separation of Norway from Sweden in 1905|declared its independence]] from Sweden, [[June 7]], [[1905]]. Although diplomats could not present credentials at foreign governments until the Swedish king formally renounced his right to the Norwegian throne, a number of unofficial representatives worked on the provisional government's behalf until the first Norwegian ambassador, [[Hjalmar Christian Hauge]] sought accreditation with [[United States]] secretary of state [[Elihu Root]] on [[November 6]], [[1905]].<br/>-<br/>-The initial purpose of the newly formed foreign ministry was both to represent Norway's interests through diplomatic channels, and to provide consular services for Norwegian shipping and commerce overseas.  In 1906, the Storting decided to establish six embassies in Europe, one in the United States, and one in [[Argentina]].  20 consular offices were also opened.<br/>-<br/>-During [[World War I]], the foreign ministry was confronted with unprecedented challenges in maintaining neutrality for Norway, in particular in order to protect its merchant fleet.  <br/>-<br/>-In [[1922]], the ministry was consolidated and reorganized to ensure fuller cooperation between the diplomatic and consular branches.  The reorganization included the formation of a designated career path for diplomats that included completion of a university entrance examination and professional experience from international trade.  The economic hardship of the times forced austerity measures at the ministry for the next several years.<br/>-<br/>-With the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939, the ministry was again overwhelmed with work.  When Norway was invaded in [[1940]], many of the ministry's archives and some of its staff were moved to Sweden for protection.  The ministry was reconstituted in exile in [[Bracknell]], outside of [[London]], moving shortly thereafter to [[Kingston House]] in London.  By the time it moved back to Norway in [[1945]], it was a well-run organization.<br/>-<br/>-Since World War II, Norway has radically increased the scale and scope of its foreign policy.  A founding member of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]], it was closely aligned with the United States during the [[Cold War]], though it maintained cordial relations with the [[Soviet Union]].  It has been an enthusiastic proponent of peaceful resolution of disputes through the offices of the [[United Nations]], contributing [[Trygve Lie]] as its first secretary general.<br/>-<br/>-==Elements of policy==<br/>-<br/>-Since the end of the Cold War, Norway has developed a model to foreign policy known as the "Norwegian model," the goal of which is to contribute to peace and stability through coordinated response among governmental and non-governmental Norwegian organizations; acting as an honest broker in international conflicts; an informal network of Norwegian individuals with access and credibility among parties; and the willingness to take the long view in international issues.<br/>-<br/>-The post-war foreign policy of Norway can described along four dimensions:<br/>-<br/>-===Strategic alliances===<br/>-<br/>-Norway's strategic importance for waging war in the North Atlantic became important in the failed neutrality policy of World War II.  Norway became a founding member of NATO in order to ally itself with countries that shared its democratic values.  Both through diplomatic and military cooperation, Norway has played a visible role in the formation and operations of NATO.  It allowed a limited number of military bases and exercises to be based in its territories, which caused some controversy when NATO decided to put forward bases in Northern Norway in preparation for a conflict with the Soviet Union.<br/>-<br/>-===International cooperation===<br/>-<br/>-[[Norway]] supports international cooperation and the peaceful settlement of disputes, recognizing the need for maintaining a strong national defense through [[collective security]]. Accordingly, the cornerstones of Norwegian policy are active membership in [[NATO]] and support for the [[United Nations]] and its specialized agencies. Norway also pursues a policy of economic, social, and cultural cooperation with other Nordic countries--[[Denmark]], [[Sweden]], [[Finland]], and [[Iceland]]--through the [[Nordic Council]]. Norway ended a 2-year term on the [[UN Security Council]] in January 2003, and chaired the [[Iraq Sanctions Committee]].<br/>-<br/>-Norway is the only [[Scandinavia|Scandinavian]] country that is not a member of the [[European Union]]. Membership has been proposed within Norway, and referendums over Norwegian membership were held in [[1972]] and [[1994]]. Popular opinion was split between rural and urban areas. <br/>-<br/>-See article on [[Norway and the European Union]]<br/>-<br/>-The present government has tabled the possibility for future membership.<br/>-<br/>-===Foreign aid===<br/>-<br/>-In addition to strengthening traditional ties with developed countries, Norway seeks to build friendly relations with developing countries and has undertaken [[humanitarian aid|humanitarian]] and [[development aid]] efforts with selected [[Africa|African]] and [[Asia|Asian]] nations. Norway also is dedicated to encouraging democracy, assisting refugees, and protecting [[human rights]] throughout the world. <br/>-<br/>-===Third party mediation in international conflicts===<br/>-<br/>-Norway has played an active role as a third party mediator in a number of international conflicts.  The late foreign minister [[Johan Jørgen Holst]] was instrumental in forging the [[Oslo Accords]] between [[Israel]] and the [[PLO]].  [[Thorvald Stoltenberg]] was part of the mediation team in seeking an end to the civil war in [[Bosnia and Hercegovina|Bosnia]].  Norway has contributed both mediation services and financial assistance in [[Guatemala]].<br/>-<br/>-As of [[2005]], Norwegian diplomats are acting as mediators in [[Sudan]], [[Bosnia and Hercegovina|Bosnia]], [[Sri Lanka]], and [[Colombia]].<br/>-<br/>-Every year since 1947 Norway gives a large [http://www.norway.org.uk/culture/misc/christmastree.htm Christmas tree to London] as a symbol of the friendship forged between the two nations during World War II.<br/>-<br/>-===International disputes===<br/>-Territorial claim in [[Antarctica]] ([[Dronning Maud Land]]) and a border dispute with [[Russia]] over the [[Barents Sea]].<br/>-<br/>-== See also ==<br/>-*[[Norway]]<br/>-*[[Scandinavian defense union]]<br/>-*[[Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]<br/>-<br/>-==External links==<br/>-* [http://odin.dep.no/ud/english/bn.html Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs website]<br/>-* [http://odin.dep.no/ud/norsk/dep/om_dep/historikk/ History of the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Norwegian]<br/>-<br/>-[[category:Foreign relations of Norway| ]]<br/>+{{current}}<br/>+{| {{prettyinfobox}}<br/>+|+ style="text-align:center; font-size:larger;" | '''Kerry Healey'''<br/>+|-<br/>+| style="background:#efefef;" align="center" colspan="2"| [[Image:kerry_healey.JPG|200px|Kerry Healey]]<br/>+|-<br/>+|-<br/>+| '''Term of Office:'''<br/>+| January, 2003 &ndash;<br/>+|-<br/>+| '''Predecessor:''' || [[Jane M.

Just prior to her election as Lieutenant Governor, Healey served as chairperson of the Massachusetts Republican State Committee. Due to Mitt Romney's announcement that he would not pursue reelection in the [[Massachusetts gubernatorial election, 2006|2006 Massachusetts gubernatorial election]], Healey formally announced on [[February 8]], 2006, that she would seek the Republican nomination for Governor. If Kerry Healey were to win the general election, she would become the first elected female Governor of Massachusetts.<br/>+<br/>+As Lieutenant Governor, Healey is the primary contact for municipal leaders regarding local finance and budget issues and co-chairs the Commonwealth's five Regional Competitiveness Councils, which are responsible for regional economic development initiatives.  Healey currently chairs several special commissions for the Governor focused on criminal justice reform, sexual and domestic violence, homelessness and the maritime economy.  She also presides over the Governor's Council, the body responsible for confirming the Governor's judicial appointments. Lt. Governor Healey is considered by some a rising star within the [[U.S. Republican party|Republican Party]].<br/>+<br/>+From 1987 to 1997, Healey served as law and public safety consultant at [[Abt Associates, Inc.]], in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].  While at Abt, she conducted research for the U.S. Department of Justice related to child abuse and neglect, domestic violence, gang violence, victim and witness intimidation and the prosecution of drug crimes.  <br/>+<br/>+===Electoral History===<br/>+*'''2002 Race for Governor/Lt.

The islands are an idyllic destination enjoyed by many cruisers.]]<br/>-'''Cruising''' is a lifestyle that involves living full-time on a boat while traveling from place to place.  Cruising generally refers to trips of a few days or more, and can extend to round-the-world voyages.  Cruising is done on both [[sailboat|sail]] and [[motorboat|power]] boats, although sail predominates over longer distances, as ocean-worthy power boats are considerably more expensive.<br/>-<br/>-Many cruisers are "long term" and travel for many years, the most adventurous circling the globe over a period of three to ten years.  Many others take a year or two off from work and school for short trips and the chance to experience the cruising lifestyle.<br/>-<br/>-"Cruising" may also refers to trips on [[cruise ship]]s, and those who take frequent cruise ships vacations (multiples times per year) may be called "cruisers".<br/>- <br/>-== History ==<br/>-<br/>-[[Image:Dugout in San Blas Islands.jpg|thumb|right|Cruisers can see traditional life in remote areas of the world; here, a [[Kuna (people)|Kuna]] local paddles a dugout canoe in the [[San Blas Islands]].]]<br/>-One of the first people to carry out a long-distance voyage for pleasure, and who inspired many others to follow in his path, was [[Joshua Slocum]], who [[circumnavigation|circumnavigated]] the world between [[1895]] and [[1898]].  Despite widespread opinion that such a voyage was impossible, Slocum, a retired sea captain, built a 37-foot sloop, ''Spray'', and sailed her [[single-handed sailing|single-handed]] around the world.  His book ''Sailing Alone Around the World'' is still considered a classic adventure, and inspired many others to take to the seas.{{ref|slocum}}<br/>-<br/>-Other cruising authors have provided both inspiration and useful instruction to would-be cruisers.  Key among these are Lin and Larry Pardey, who in [[1969]] set off on a short cruise from the USA to Mexico, which turned into a circumnavigation of the world.  They wrote a series of books about their voyage, as well as several reference books on cruising.<br/>-<br/>-== Techniques ==<br/>-<br/>-As well as normal sailing and seamanship skills, cruisers use a variety of equipment and tehniques to make their voyages possible, or simply more comfortable.<br/>-<br/>-[[Image:Solar_panels_on_yacht_at_sea.jpg|thumb|right|The solar panels on this 28-foot yacht can keep her self-sufficient in electrical power.]]<br/>-One of the key areas is providing the electrical power to keep the boat's systems (lights, communications gear, etc.) running.  Although most boats can generate power from their inboard engines, and some carry generators, carrying sufficient fuel for these over a long voyage con be a problem; and so many cruising boats are equipped with generating devices such as [[solar panel]]s, [[wind turbine]]s, etc.<br/>-<br/>-While it is quite possible (and, until relatively recently, normal) to cruise without long-distance communications equipment, such gear is becoming more common on cruising boats.  Many boats are now equipped with [[satellite telephone]] systems; however, these systems can be expensive to use, and may operate only in restricted areas.  Many cruisers still rely on the older [[short wave]] maritime [[single-sideband modulation|SSB]] radio stadard, which has no running costs, and can (with suitable equipment) allow sending and receving of email.<br/>-<br/>-== Further reading ==<br/>-<br/>-* Elbert Maloney, "Dutton's Navigation and Piloting"- a classic, professional reference, continuously updated.<br/>-* Nathaniel Bowditch, "The American Practical Navigator"- A classic, prefessional reference, continuously updated.<br/>-* U.S. Naval Institute, "The Bluejackets' Manual"- the navy way; the authority on Morse, flags, courtesies, fire-fighting at sea, jury-rigging, ship handling and basic sea law.<br/>-* Lawrence and Lin Pardey, "Storm Tactics"- A must-read book.<br/>-* Linda & Steve Dashew, "Offshore Cruisers' Encyclopedia"- expensive but so useful it has been compared to Bowditch and Dutton.

For people with the same name, see [[Yo-Yo (rapper)]] or [[Yo-Yo Ma]].''<br/>-<br/>-The '''yo-yo''' is a [[toy]] consisting of two equally-sized discs of [[plastic]], [[wood]], or [[metal]], connected with an [[axle]], around which [[twine]] is wound. There is a slip knot at the free end of the string, and, on a properly strung yo-yo, an uncut loop around the axle end which allows it to spin freely, or "sleep" upon reaching the string's end.<br/>-<br/>-It is played by tying the string's free end around the middle finger, grasping the yo-yo, and then throwing it with a smooth motion. As the axle spins within the loop, a [[gyroscope|gyroscopic]] effect occurs, permitting time to perform a number of movements. By flicking the wrist, the yo-yo can be made to return to the player's hand, with the cord again completely wound into the groove. Any movement, or combination of movements, which result in the return of the yo-yo to the player's hand in this fashion is considered a ''trick''.<br/>-<br/>-Yo-yoing is a popular pastime around the world. Although generally associated with children, it is not uncommon for people who gain a level of proficiency at the sport in youth to continue playing into adulthood.  <br/>-<br/>-==History of the yo-yo==<br/>-Contrary to popular myth, there is not evidence that the yo-yo is derived from, nor even existed in any form intended for use as a [[weapon]]. While the impact generated by a yo-yo could indeed be rendered deadly with the addition of sharpened edges, the difficulty of safely retrieving it would render such a device somewhat impractical. This rumor likely originated in the [[Philippines]], where hunters in the [[16th century]] used sharp rocks with strings attached to kill prey from trees. The development of the modern yo-yo began in the Philippines at around this time, which is probably the source of the confusion.<br/>-<br/>-===Ancient origins===<br/>-The yo-yo is a truly ancient form of amusement with as many names as [[culture]]s which have assimilated it. [[Archaeology|Archaeologically]], it is the second oldest toy known (after [[doll]]s). Although it is thought to have originated in [[China]], evidence of yo-yo-like toys first appears in the historical record around [[500s BC|500 B.C.]] in [[Ancient Greece|ancient]] [[Greece]].  A [[terra cotta]] yo-yo, as well as a vase depicting play, are on display in the [[National Museum of Athens]].<br/>-<br/>-The toy is likely to have spread throughout [[Asia]] and [[Europe]] via [[trade route]]s, and is known to have enjoyed periods of popularity in [[Scotland]], [[England]], [[India]], and even [[Egypt]]. The ''emigrette'' gained particular notoriety in the [[western world]] during the [[French revolution]]; it was seen as a welcome source of relief from stress, likely epidemic during that period of [[France|French]] history.<br/>-<br/>-Yo-yos would incubate for a time in the [[South China Sea]] near their supposed point of origin before leaping across the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] and exploding [[commerce|commercially]] in the [[New World]] to become an international phenomenon.<br/>-<br/>-===The yo-yo in modern times===<br/>-As mentioned previously, the modern incarnation of the device was refined in the [[Philippines]], where tradition maintains that use of the folk toy dates back at least a number of centuries. The name ''yo-yo'' is believed to have derived from [[Tagalog_language|Tagalog]] and translates as "come-come". In reality, however, ''yo-yo'' is not a Tagalog word (the word for "come" is ''halika''). It is possible that the term came from another [[Languages of the Philippines|Philippine language]]. The term was first published in a dictionary of Filipino words printed in [[1860]]. The principal distinction between the Filipino design and previous, more primitive "back-and-forth" models is in the way the yo-yo is strung. One continuous piece of string, double the desired length, is twisted around itself to produce a loop at one end (as shown at left) which is fitted around the axle. Also termed a ''looped slip-string'', this seemingly minor modification allows for a far greater variety and sophistication of motion, thanks to increased stability and suspension of movement during free spin. It is, without a doubt, the most important development in the evolution of the yo-yo.<br/>-<br/>-[[Image:yoyo_patent_1866.png|thumbnail|180px|right|U.S. patent #59745]]<br/>-<br/>-The first [[United States]] [[patent]] on the toy was issued to James L. Haven and Charles Hettrich in [[1866]] ({{US patent|59,745}}) under the name ''whirligig'', however, the yo-yo would remain in relative anonymity until [[1928]] when a [[Filipino Americans|Filipino American]] named [[Pedro Flores]] opened the '''Yo-Yo Manufacturing Company''' in [[Santa Barbara, California]]. The business started with a dozen handmade toys; by [[November]] of [[1929]], Flores was operating two additional factories in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and [[Hollywood]], which altogether employed 600 workers and produced 300,000 units ''daily''. Shortly thereafter (''ca.'' [[1930]]), an entrepreneur named [[Donald Duncan]] recognized the potential of this new fad and purchased the Flores Yo-yo Corporation and all its assets, including the Flores name, which was transferred to the new company in [[1932]]. He is reputed to have paid more than $250,000, a fortune by [[Great Depression|depression era]] standards. It turned out to be a sound investment, making many, many times this amount in the years to follow.<br/>-<br/>-===Commercial success===<br/>-A [[chart]] of the yo-yo's commercial history would mimic the path of the toy itself, finding peaks and lows many times over the course of the [[20th century]]. In 1946, Duncan opened a yo-yo factory in the [[Luck, Wisconsin]], prompting the town to dub itself 'Yo-yo Capital of the World.  Declining sales after the [[World War II|second World War]] prompted Duncan to launch a comeback campaign for his trademarked "Yo-Yo" in [[1962]] with a series of [[television]] [[advertising|advertisements]]. The media blitz met with unprecedented success, thanks in great part to the introduction of the Duncan Butterfly, which was effectively an inverse version of the classic Imperial design that made landing the yo-yo on its string (in tricks such as "trapeze") much more accessible to the beginner. This success would be short-lived, however, and in a landmark [[intellectual property]] case in [[1965]], a federal appeals court ruled in favor of the Royal Tops Company, determining that ''Yo-Yo'' had become a part of common speech and that Duncan no longer had exclusive rights to the term. As a result of the expenses incurred by this legal battle as well as other financial pressures, the Duncan family sold the company name and associated trademarks in [[1968]] to Flambeau Plastics, who had manufactured Duncan's plastic models since [[1955]]. They continue to run the company today. In the 1970s there was a yo-yo fad when [[SKF]] made yo-yos with [[ball bearings]]. It was probably started as a [[marketing]] gimmick, but it caught on.<br/>-<br/>-==Contemporary yo-yo culture==<br/>-<br/>-The 1990s saw a resurgence of the popularity of the Yo-Yo and Yo-Yo culture. Contributing to this [[fad]] was the introduction of the [[Yomega]] Brain auto-return Yo-Yo, the Playmaxx (later [[Duncan]]) Pro-yo and various imitations of these. The Brain yo-yo contained a centripital clutch mechanism which, as the spin of the yoyo slows to a predertermined RPM, engages, freezing the spinning axle and causing the yoyo to automatically return to its user's hand. The Pro-yo was a take-apart fixed axle yoyo.<br/>-<br/>-===Yo-yo contests===<br/>-[[Image:Us yoyo national 1a.jpg|left|thumb|155px|A 1A division finalist at the 2004 US nationals in [[Chico, CA]].]]<br/>-[[Image:Us yoyo national 2a.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A 2A division finalist at the 2004 US nationals in [[Chico, CA]].]]<br/>-<br/>-Yo-yo competitions are held at the world level, and in the United<br/>-States, at the national and regional levels. In freestyle yo-yo<br/>-competitions, players perform a routine to their choice of music in<br/>-front of a panel of judges. Currently there are five freestyle divisions:<br/>-<br/>-*1A The player uses a long spinning yo-yo to perform tricks that typically require manipulation of the string.<br/>-*2A The player uses two yo-yos simultaneously to perform reciprocating or looping maneuvers. This tends to be the most visually entertaining style with some players incorporating acrobatics into their routines.<br/>-*3A The player uses two long spinning yo-yos and performs tricks with both simultaneously.<br/>-*4A The player uses an ''offstring'' yo-yo, often releasing the yo-yo into the air and attempting to catch it on the string.<br/>-*5A The player uses a yo-yo with a counterweight on the other end of the string rather than having it attached to a finger.<br/>-*AP This is Artistic Performance where the yo-yoer uses any type of yo-yo or other prop in order to perform a freestyle.<br/>-Competitors usually bring a number of yo-yos to the performance stage with them to allow for mid-routine replacements in the case of tangling (common with string tricks), breakage (common with looping tricks), or drops (common with offstring tricks).<br/>-<br/>-===Yo-yo club (sport)===<br/>-A [[yo yo club]] is a sporting side (typically in [[soccer]] / [[association football]]) that is regularly promoted and relegated between a higher and lower league and division.<br/>-<br/>-==See also==<br/>-*[[Chinese yo-yo]], or [[diabolo]]<br/>-*[[List of yo-yo tricks]]<br/>-*Yo-yo is a slang word in [[Ireland]] for [[euro]], replacing the earlier slang of [[quid]] for the [[Irish pound]].<br/>-*[[Yo-yo ball]]<br/>-<br/>-==External links==<br/>-*[http://www.hkyyfc.org.hk/ HKYYFC] Hong Kong Yo-Yo Fans Club official web site<br/>-*[http://hk.geocities.com/yohin1987/ Tomodachi] Web site of a Hong Kong top player<br/>-*[http://hk.geocities.com/mingyomegahk/ Know Da Throw Know Da Ming] Web site of Team Yomega Hong Kong player<br/>-*[http://kwos.yoyoing.com/ Begin2Spin] Beginners instruction site.<br/>-*[http://www.yoyoguy.com/info/yoyo/ How to Yo-Yo] Clearly illustrated beginner yo-yo tricks.<br/>-*[http://www.worldyoyocontest.com/ World Yo-Yo Contest] The World Yo-Yo Contest Web Site<br/>-*[http://www.nationalyoyo.org/ National Yo-Yo] Contest and Museum Website<br/>-*[http://www.ayya.org/ American Yo-Yo Association]<br/>-*[http://www.wyya.org Yo-Yo Associations Worldwide]<br/>-*[http://www.spintastics.com/HistoryOfYoYo.asp History of the Yo-Yo] at ''Spintastics''<br/>-*[http://europe.wyya.org European Yo-Yo Page]<br/>-*[http://www.yoyowiki.org/ The Yo-Yo Wiki]<br/>-*[http://www.kwos.ca/ Ken's World on a String] Yo-Yo Tricks site with colorful illustrations and videos<br/>-*[http://www.yo-yo.com/ Official Duncan Yo-Yo Website]<br/>-*[http://www.smothersbrothers.com/yoyoman.html Yo-Yo Man Homepage] on Smothers Brothers Website<br/>-*[http://www.dazzlingdave.com/other_stuff/lucky/luckys.html Lucky's Guide to Yo-Yo Collecting]<br/>-*[http://www.nmia.com/~whistler/museum/patent2.pdf A listing of Yo-yo related U.S. patents] compiled by collector Rick Brough<br/>-*[http://www.doctorpopular.com/ Retro Winding Double Knob Toy] Official Website of 3rd place world yoyo champion Doctor Popular<br/>-*[http://www.yo-yos.us/ Lee's Yo-Yo Page] yo-yo links and information<br/>-*[http://extremespin.org/forum/ The ExtremeSpin Forum] Large yo-yo discussion forum<br/>-*[http://extremespin.org ExtremeSpin.org] Free webspace for yo-yo sites and videos<br/>-*[http://www.yo-yo.org/ Yo-Yo.org]; Free web space for yo-yocentric web communities<br/>-*[http://www.yoyoing.com/news Yoyoing.com's message board]; Yoyoing.com's message board<br/>-*[http://www.tym.de Team Yo-Yo Maniac (TYM)]<br/>-*[http://www.gyya.de GYYA-German Yo-Yo Association]<br/>-*[http://links.tym.de More Yo-Yo links]<br/>-*[http://www.idahoyoyo.com Idaho's State Yo-yo Website]<br/>-*[http://www.dif-spinners.com Dif-Spinners] Harry Houdini yoyo website<br/>-*[http://theyo.com/messageboard/ Yo Yo Forum]<br/>-<br/>-[[Category:Toys]]<br/>-[[Category:1930s fads]]<br/>-[[category:1990s fads]]<br/>-[[Category:National Toy Hall of Fame]]<br/>-[[Category:Yo-yos]]<br/>-<br/>-[[da:Yoyo]]<br/>-[[de:Yo-Yo]]<br/>-[[es:Yo-yo]]<br/>-[[eo:Jojo]]<br/>-[[fr:Yo-yo]]<br/>-[[id:Yoyo]]<br/>-[[he:יו-יו]]<br/>-[[hu:Jojó]]<br/>-[[ms:Yo-yo]]<br/>-[[nl:Jojo (speelgoed)]]<br/>-[[ja:ヨーヨー]]<br/>-[[pl:Jojo (zabawka)]]<br/>-[[pt:Ioiô]]<br/>-[[sv:Jojo (leksak)]]<br/>+{{style-guideline}}<br/>+{| style="float:right; background:transparent"<br/>+|-<br/>+|<br/>+{{shortcut|[[MoS:DP]]<br/>[[WP:MOSDAB]]}}<br/>+|-<br/>+|<br/>+{{Style}}<br/>+|}<br/>+'''Disambiguation pages''' ("dab pages") are, like [[Wikipedia:Redirect|redirects]], non-article pages in the article namespace. [[Wikipedia:disambiguation|Disambiguation]] pages are solely intended to allow users to choose among several Wikipedia articles, usually when a user searches for an ambiguous term. This style guideline is intended to make this process more efficient by giving disambiguation pages a consistent look and avoiding distracting information, such as extraneous links (internal or external).<br/>+<br/>+This guide applies to pages containing only disambiguation content, whether or not the page title contains the word "(disambiguation)". This guide does not apply to articles which are about a primary topic but contain a [[Wikipedia:Hatnotes|"see also" notice]] or the like.<br/>+<br/>+==Linking to Wiktionary==<br/>+Rather than including a dictionary definition of a word, create a cross-link to our sister project, [[Wiktionary]]. To do this, use one of the "Wiktionary parameter templates" on the first line.  The multiple-option templates are useful if you want to link to dictionary entries with alternate capitalizations (star, Star, and STAR, for example).<br/>+<br/>+* {{tl|Wiktionarypar}} - <nowiki>{{wiktionarypar|WORD}}</nowiki>  <br/>+* {{tl|Wiktionarypar2}} - <nowiki>{{wiktionarypar2|insert 1st word here|insert 2nd word here}}</nowiki><br/>+* {{tl|Wiktionarypar3}} and {{tl|Wiktionarypar4}} follow the same pattern<br/>+<br/>+The basic {{tl|wiktionary}} template is deprecated because it uses the page name, which starts with an uppercase letter, and Wiktionary is now case sensitive on the first letter. For more information on linking see [[Wikipedia:Sister projects#Wiktionary]].<br/>+<br/>+==Linking to a primary topic==<br/>+When a page has "(disambiguation)" in the title, users are unlikely to stumble on it by accident. They will get there by clicking on a link from the primary topic article, by searching, or by directly typing its URL.<br/>+<br/>+The link on the main article should be similar to:<br/>+:''For other uses, see [[School (disambiguation)]].''<br/>+<br/>+Since it's very unlikely that this well-known meaning is what they're looking for, it shouldn't be mixed in with the other links. It is recommended to place the link back to the primary topic at the top, like this:<br/>+:{| style="border: 1px solid black" width=100%<br/>+|-<br/>+|<br/>+A '''[[school]]''' is an institution for learning.<br/>+<br/>+'''School''' may also mean:<br/>+*[[School (discipline)]], a group of people with common characteristics in what they do &mdash; such as: a school of painting, or a school of thought<br/>+*[[School (song)|"School" (song)]], by the grunge music group Nirvana<br/>+*[[School Street]], Chicago<br/>+*[[Swarm]] of fish<br/>+|}<br/>+<br/>+==Introductory line==<br/>+Like a standard article, the title of the page should be in '''bold''' (not ''italic''). It should begin a sentence fragment ending with a colon, introducing a bulleted list:<br/>+:{| style="border: 1px solid black" width=60%<br/>+|-<br/>+|<br/>+'''XYZ''' may refer to:<br/>+<br/>+'''Interval''' may mean:<br/>+<br/>+'''John Smith''' is the name of:<br/>+<br/>+'''ABC''' may stand for:<br/>+<br/>+|}<br/>+<br/>+It is not necessary to repeat all the possible variations of capitalization or punctuation: "'''AU''' may refer to" is preferable over "'''AU''', '''au''', '''Au''' or '''A-U''' may refer to".<br/>+<br/>+==Individual entries==<br/>+Keep in mind that the primary purpose of the disambiguation page is to help people find the information they want quickly and easily. These pages aren't for exploration, but only to help the user navigate to a specific article. <br/>+*Start each entry with a '''bullet''' (an asterisk in wiki markup) and a '''capital letter'''.  Only entries that link, not leading lines, should have bullet points.<br/>+*Try to link to the disambiguated page with the first word in the line, so:<br/>+**[[Goal (soccer)]], the thing at each end of a soccer field<br/>+**'''not:''' In soccer, [[Goal (sport)|goal]] means the thing at each end of a soccer field.<br/>+*There is '''no need to emphasize the link with bolding''' ''or italics'', although titles (such as for books and movies) may need to be italicized, in conformance with [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (titles)]].  If the article's title contains both a title and a clarifier, use a piped link to quote or italicize only the title (see [[#Piping|below]]).<br/>+* Unlike a regular article page, '''don't wikilink any other words in the line''', unless they may be essential to help the reader determine where they might find the information. For example:<br/>+**"[[Dark Star]]", a song by the Grateful Dead<br/>+**'''not:''' "[[Dark Star]]", a [[song]] by the [[psychedelic]] [[rock band]] [[The Grateful Dead]]<br/>+*Entries should nearly always be sentence fragments.  When the entry forms a complete sentence, do not include commas or periods at the end of the line.<br/>+ <br/>+'''Example''':<br/>+:{| style="border: 1px solid black" width=100%<br/>+|-<br/>+|'''Interval''' may mean:<br/>+*[[Interval (mathematics)]], a certain subset of an ordered set<br/>+*[[Interval (music)]], the relationship between two notes<br/>+|}<br/>+<br/>+===Examples=== <br/>+<span id="Specific_instances"></span><br/>+On a page called ''Title'', generally do not disambiguate:<br/>+* ''Title'' County <br/>+* ''Title'' City<br/>+* ''Title'' Hospital<br/>+* ''Title'' University<br/>+<br/>+You may want to disambiguate on the same page:<br/>+*''TITLE'' and ''Title''<br/>+*''Title'' town and ''Title'' township<br/>+<br/>+"''Title'' Island", "''Title'' River" or "River ''Title''" may be worth listing in cases where the "Island"/"River" part is often omitted.<br/>+<br/>+In most cases, do not list names of which ''Title'' is a part, unless the persons are very frequently referred to simply by their first or last name (e.g. [[Galileo]], [[Shakespeare]]).<br/>+<br/>+===Issues===<br/>+In general, inline descriptions are problematic (because links to disambiguation pages should be avoided), so they are likely to be neglected for lack of visibility.  Common misspellings should only be listed if you would [[Wikipedia:Redirect|redirect]] to the correct title if there were no other disambiguations, and as noted above, only if the articles exist or should be written and there is a real risk of confusion.  For example, [[Kington (disambiguation)|Kington]] could include a link to [[Kingston (disambiguation)|Kingston]].  Misspellings on disambiguation pages can be listed in a separate section entitled "Common misspellings" or "see also."  Links to misspellings should not be added when no other disambiguation takes place, unless they are notable enough to be added inline in the article.<br/>+<br/>+===Piping===<br/>+[[Wikipedia:Piped link|Piping]] means concealing the actual title of a linked article by replacing it with other text, typically to suppress parenthetical expressions.<br/>+<br/>+'''Don't''' pipe the name of the links to the articles being listed (for example, [[Moment (physics)]]). In many cases, this may be all the user needs to distinguish the article.<br/>+<br/>+Exceptions:<br/>+#Use piping if you're linking to an anchor point on the target page.<br/>+#Use piping if the article title differs from what it should be due to technical limitations per {{tl|Wrongtitle}}; for instance [[USS Adder (SS-3)|USS ''Adder'' (SS-3)]] or [[LaTeX|L<sup>A</sup>T<sub><big>E</big></sub>X]].<br/>+# Use piping to italicize or quote the title portion of an article whose name consists of both a title and a clarifier; for instance [[Harvey (movie)|''Harvey'' (movie)]] or [[School (song)|"School" (song)]].<br/>+<br/>+If a word in the description is linked (an unusual occurrence), you may use piping in that link.<br/>+<br/>+===Specific entry types===<br/>+<br/>+====Foreign languages====<br/>+For '''foreign-language terms''', be sure an article exists or could be written for the word or phrase in question. Usually this means that the term has been at least partially adopted into English or is used by specialists.<br/>+:{| style="border: 1px solid black" width=100%<br/>+|-<br/>+|'''Tambo''' may be:<br/>+*[[Tambo (weapon)]], a very short staff used in martial arts<br/>+|}<br/>+Avoid adding lines for words or phrases that are simply spelled the same as an English term. For example, avoid: <br/>+*'''Tambo''', a Japanese word (&#30000;&#12435;&#12412;) for rice paddy<br/>+<br/>+====People====<br/>+{{See also|List of people by name}}<br/>+For '''people''', include their birth and death years (when known), and only enough descriptive information that the reader can distinguish between different people with the same name.  Keep in mind the conventions for birth and death dates, see [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (dates and numbers)#Dates of birth and death]].<br/>+:{| style="border: 1px solid black" width=100%<br/>+|-<br/>+|'''John Smith''' is the name of:<br/>+*[[John Smith (filmmaker)]] (born 1952), London-based avant-garde filmmaker<br/>+*[[John Smith (mathematician)]] (18th century), mathematician at the University of Oxford, 1766&ndash;1797<br/>+*[[John Smith (Ohio Senator)]] (1735&ndash;1824)<br/>+|}<br/>+<br/>+====Places====<br/>+For '''places''', it may only be necessary to write the name of the article.<br/>+:{| style="border: 1px solid black" width=100%<br/>+|-<br/>+|'''Jacksonville''' may mean:<br/>+*[[Jacksonville, Florida]]<br/>+*[[Jacksonville, Alabama]]<br/>+*[[Jacksonville, Arkansas]]<br/>+|}<br/>+<br/>+It might be appropriate to add the country after the link.  Leave the country unlinked.<br/>+:{| style="border: 1px solid black" width=100%<br/>+|-<br/>+|'''Kimberley''' is the name of:<br/>+*[[Kimberley, Nottinghamshire]], England <br/>+*[[Kimberley, British Columbia]], Canada <br/>+|}<br/>+<br/>+====Redlinks====<br/>+Links to non-existent articles ("redlinks") may be included only when an editor is confident that an encyclopedia article could be written on the subject. <br/>+<br/>+Adding links to articles not yet written should be done with care.  There is no need to brainstorm all occurrences of the page title and create redlinks to articles that are unlikely ever to be written, or likely to be removed as insufficiently notable topics.  <br/>+<br/>+For example, quite a few words will show up as song titles. With few exceptions, individual songs are rarely notable, so there is no point in linking to them.  When adding this type of information, be sure to link to at least one existing article (band, album, ''et cetera'').<br/>+<br/>+Do include a redlink when another article links to the ambiguous article with none of the disambiguation options in mind.  (A list of links to an article can be obtained using [[Wikipedia:What links here|Special:What links here]].)<br/>+<br/>+====Ships====<br/>+{{main|Wikipedia:WikiProject Ships#Index Pages|Wikipedia:WikiProject Ships#Index page template}}<br/>+<br/>+Lists consisting entirely of ships replace disambiguation pages.  Where a vessel is listed among other entries by a hull number or other abbreviation, the entry should conform to the style for ships.<br/>+<br/>+====Synonyms====<br/>+If the link is to a '''synonym''', simply use it as it is named:<br/>+:{| style="border: 1px solid black" width=100%<br/>+|-<br/>+|'''Serving spoon''' may also be:<br/>+*[[Tablespoon]]<br/>+|}<br/>+<br/>+====URL anchor notaton====<br/>+If the item described appears '''as part of another page''', link to the relevant section of that page instead (using the [[Wikipedia:How to edit a page#Links and URLs|#anchor notation]]) and conceal that by making it a piped link, as shown with "coin", below.  In this case the link may not start the line, but it should still be the only wikilink.<br/>+:{| style="border: 1px solid black" width=100%<br/>+|-<br/>+|'''Tail''' may also be:<br/>+*The reverse side of a [[coin#Features of modern coinage|coin]]<br/>+*Part of an airplane [[fuselage]]<br/>+*Part of a [[bird]]'s anatomy<br/>+|}<br/>+Only use this feature if the item being described actually appears on the page you're linking to, so avoid:<br/>+*'''On-off switch''' is what turns on a [[television]] set<br/>+if the [[television]] article doesn't mention it.<br/>+<br/>+==Order of entries==<br/>+In most cases, place the items in order of usage, with the most-used meanings appearing at the top and less common meanings below. A recommended order is:<br/>+#Articles with a clarifier in parentheses ([[Anticipation (music)]])<br/>+#Articles with the item as part of the name ([[Computer keyboard]] as part of a '''Keyboard''' dab page)<br/>+#Synonyms<br/>+#Larger subject articles which treat this item in a section ([[Medieval art]] from a '''Fresco''' dab page)<br/>+<br/>+For places or people, alphabetical or chronological order may make more sense &mdash; but only for articles that are equally common. Always place the most-common meaning(s) at the top.<br/>+<br/>+Unless the list is quite short, separate the articles in categories (1) and (2) from those in (3) and (4), with the "may also be" line shown below:<br/>+:{| style="border: 1px solid black" width=100%<br/>+|-<br/>+|'''Thingymabob''' may mean:<br/>+*[[Thingymabob (mathematics)]], the square root of minus-pi<br/>+*[[Thingymabob (music)]], a note slightly higher than Q-sharp<br/>+*[[House thingymabob]], a phallic door-knocker<br/>+*[[Computer thingymabob]], carving-knife device for cutting off mouse's tail<br/>+'''Thingymabob''' may also be:<br/>+*[[Whatchamacallit]]<br/>+*[[Doodad]]<br/>+*A fetish used in [[Tribal ceremonies]].<br/>+|}<br/>+<br/>+== Longer lists ==<br/>+The list may be broken up by subject area:<br/>+:{| style="border: 1px solid black" width=100%<br/>+|-<br/>+|<br/>+'''Thingamajig''' may mean:<br/>+<br/>+In '''science''':<br/>+*[[Thingamajig (chemistry)]], an isotope of chlorine<br/>+*[[Thingamajig (physics)]], a kind of pulsar<br/>+*[[Thingamajig (biology)]], an invasive plant used as ground cover<br/>+In '''world music''':<br/>+*[[Thingamajig (Qatar)]], a seven-stringed musical instrument<br/>+*[[Thingamajig (Peru)]], a wind instrument similar to an aulos<br/>+|}<br/>+<br/>+If the list is longer than a single display page (more than thirty entries), use level 2 section headers instead (or in addition), as on [[Aurora (disambiguation)]]. Only a single level of section headers should ever be necessary. Use {{tl|TOCright}} to place the table of contents on the right hand side.<br/>+<br/>+==The "See also" section==<br/>+There may be a "see also" section for similar terms which may be confused, misspellings, and the like, but don't use "see also" for any legitimate use of the main title word.<br/>+<br/>+==The disambig notice==<br/>+Place the template {{tl|disambig}} at the bottom of the page. It produces the following message (as of December 2005), and  also assigns the [[:Category:Disambiguation]] to the page.<br/>+<br/>+<div class="notice metadata" id="disambig">''This is a [[Wikipedia:disambiguation|disambiguation]] page &mdash; a list of articles associated with the same title.

Experience has shown that ''ad hoc'' and un-discussed category creation is controversial and prone to create agitation among the many editors working in the area of disambiguation.  [[Wikipedia:Be bold|Be bold]], but as that exhortation warns, [[Wikipedia:Be bold#...but don't be reckless!|don't be reckless]].<br/>+<br/>+==Break rules==<br/>+For every style suggestion above, there's some page which has a good reason to do something else.

Based on a design already used for the [[Denver and Rio Grande]], it was much less decorative than the [[Rogers K class]] that had immediately preceded it, utilised a wheel arrangement of [[2-8-0]], and although it was very powerful for its day, it was typically limited to a speed of 29 km/h (18 mph).  This meant that it was usually assigned to freight trains and was generally seen working on the [[Otago Central Railway]] and steeper parts of the [[Main South Line]] such as the route between [[Dunedin]] and [[Oamaru]].  The class was introduced in early [[1880]] after being ordered in [[1879]], and around the beginning of the [[20th century]], the class received new [[boilers]] and two were moved north to [[Auckland]] to assist on the new [[North Island Main Trunk]].  As time progressed, the T class progressively lost work to more powerful, newer locomotives, and ended their days shunting major yards.  None survived to be preserved and all members of the class were scrapped.  The first two, T 101 and T 104, were withdrawn in March [[1922]], and the other four followed in March [[1928]].<br/>+She became a star overnight following the international success of the social drama ''[[Secrets & Lies]]'' in 1996, becoming the very first black English actress nominated for an [[Academy Award|Oscar]].

In this year, the business sector generated sales of 25.3 billion euros. Aside from the healthy state of the global automotive business, the high demand for modern diesel systems had a positive effect. The share of diesel engines in newly registered cars in western Europe rose to 48% in 2004. Bosch has played a major role in shaping this trend. With third-generation common-rail technology, Bosch has the most advanced system on today's market, with additional improvements in performance, consumption, and eco-friendliness. Bosch is also developing a particulate filter, whose production will start in 2006.<br/>-Ten years ago, Bosch was the first supplier to bring the Electronic Stability Program (ESP) to the market. Studies around the world have proved that this safety system can help significantly reduce the number of accidents. In Europe, the share of newly registered cars featuring ESP reached 36 percent in 2004. <br/>-<br/>-===Industrial Technology===<br/>-Bosch's subsidiary Bosch Rexroth is one of the leading suppliers in the world market for industrial technology.

There are an estimated 4.5 millions Catholics in the Netherlands, 28 percent of the population. There are seven [[diocese]]s in the Netherlands. The number of [[parish]]es has decreased from 1,744 in [[1990]] to 1,600 in [[2000]]. The number of Catholics in the Netherlands has also decreased in recent years, due to secularization and to a relatively low [[fertility]] rate among Catholics. This trend is largely visible in the four northern dioceses ([[Groningen (city)|Groningen]], [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], [[Haarlem]] and [[Rotterdam]]), who lost a total of 475,000 members between 1990 and 2000.

He added that an architect should be well versed in fields such as [[music]], [[astronomy]],  [[philosophy]].  This opinion is still true to this day, as music is a play of pitches/tones with silences a modulation in sound whilst architecture is a play of solids with voids. [[Aztec]] temples, [[Ancient Egyptian]] [[pyramids]] and [[China]]'s [[Forbidden City]] were based on cardinal points of astronomy and on the earth's geological data, something that Vitruvius could not have known.  With philosophy, meaning lover of wisdom would be an appropriate attribute for an architect in the days of Vitruvius given the diverse fields of knowledge an architect need to embody.

It was previously known by its [[Code name|codename]] '''Longhorn''', after the Longhorn Saloon, a popular bar in [[Whistler, British Columbia]] (see the other [[Microsoft codenames]]). The name "Vista" was unveiled on [[July 22]], [[2005]]. According to sources, the scheduled release date for Windows Vista is currently [[July 23]], [[2006]]. That release date is only scheduled for PC vendors so that systems will be made Vista-ready before Christmas. The general public availability is projected to be around late September to early October 2006, five years after the release of Windows XP, making this the longest time span between releases of desktop versions of Microsoft's Windows operating system. <br/>+<br/>+Windows Vista has many new features such as an updated [[graphical user interface]] called [[Aero (user interface)|Aero]], improved [[Windows_indexing_service|searching]] technology, a number of new security features, and completely new networking, audio, print, and display engines. Vista also aims to increase the level of communication between machines on a home network using [[Peer-to-peer]] technology, making it easy to share files, password settings, and digital media between computers and devices.  Windows Vista also has an entirely new [[development]] [[API]], called [[WinFX]], based on the [[.NET framework]], which aims to make it significantly easier for developers to write high-quality applications than with WinFX's predecessor, [[Win32]].<br/>+<br/>+Windows Vista will carry the version number 6.0 ([[Windows 2000]], Windows XP and [[Windows Server 2003]] being [[Windows NT]] versions 5.0, 5.1 and 5.2, respectively).<br/>+<br/>+[[Windows Server "Longhorn"]], the successor to Windows Server 2003, is also under development, and will be based on the Windows Vista codebase.  It is expected to be released in the first half of 2007.<br/>+<br/>+<div style="float: left; margin-right: 20px">__TOC__</div><br/>+<br/>+==Overview==<br/>+Windows Vista was originally expected to ship sometime late in 2003 as a minor step between Windows XP and [[Windows "Vienna"]]. Gradually, Vista assimilated many important new features and technologies of "Vienna", and so the date of release was pushed back to first quarter of 2006. In August 2004, Microsoft announced that it was making changes to what was then only known as "Longhorn". Microsoft basically started development afresh, building on the Windows Server 2003 codebase. This decision was reached in the wake of Windows XP Service Pack 2.  As part of this decision, Microsoft announced that it is delaying the release of [[WinFS]] so that Vista could be released in "a reasonable timeframe".<br/>+<br/>+Vista Beta 1 (build 5112) is currently available to [[Microsoft Developer Network]] (MSDN) and [[TechNet]] subscribers as well as a select group of Microsoft Beta testers and at select Microsoft developer conferences such as the [[Professional Developers Conference]] (PDC) and [[WinHEC]]. The preview release is classified as a beta version at the moment, although its feature set is not representative of the release product. Like many other products (including all Windows releases since Windows 98), it has since been leaked onto popular networks ([[file sharing]] or otherwise) such as [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]], [[BitTorrent]], [[eDonkey network|eDonkey]] and various [[newsgroup]]s.<br/>+<br/>+With build 5219, Microsoft started releasing monthly [[CTP|Community Technical Previews]] (CTP) to beta testers. Build 5219 was distributed among 2005 PDC attendees, and has been released to Microsoft Beta testers and MSDN subscribers. It is also known as CTP1. Although not enabled by default, this refresh sees the return of the [[Windows Sidebar]], which had been removed from previous builds due to a [[memory leak]], and the introduction of [[Desktop Gadgets]], both of which are part of [[Microsoft gadgets]] line of mini-applications. These are similar to Apple's widgets. Microsoft has stated that these Gadgets will be available at [http://www.microsoftgadgets.com/ www.microsoftgadgets.com], and they will be available for Windows XP as well. It also supported a new version of Windows Media Center code-named '''"Diamond"''' (previously only available in [[Windows XP Media Center Edition]]).<br/>+<br/>+Although Microsoft has stated that [[WinFS]] will not make its wide reaching debut in Windows Vista, users of the 5219 build noticed that WinFS is in fact included in that version. Several Windows 'rumor' sites and newsgroups such as Neowin and Paul Thurrott's Windows SuperSite have made speculation that WinFS will in fact be ready on time for Windows Vista's release.<br/>+<br/>+About two weeks before its intended release, and one week after build 5219 was released, build 5231 was leaked, unfortunately containing a number of critical bugs. On schedule, about two weeks later, Microsoft released 5231, also known as CTP2 or the October 2005 CTP, to MSDN subscribers and Microsoft Beta Testers. This "Ultimate" build introduced the next version of [[Windows Media Player]] (version 11).<br/>+<br/>+On November 22, 2005, the Windows Vista TAP Preview (build 5259) was released to TAP members, four days after its originally announced release date of November 18th as a November CTP. Microsoft cancelled the November CTP due to the instability of that build, and decided to release it only to TAP members. Microsoft's plans for releasing additional monthly CTP builds are unclear. The December CTP (build 5270), which was released to testers and MSDN on December 19, is very close to feature complete. The first feature-complete CTP is expected to be the upcoming February CTP, due out February 21.<br/>+<br/>+Following that, Microsoft will release another CTP on April 12th.  This will be the next CTP on the Beta 2 track, and will be available through Microsoft's Customer Preview Program — essentially a free download.  According to [[James Allchin|Jim Allchin]], the co-President at Microsoft responsible for Windows Vista, there will be no "Release Candidates" as with previous versions of Windows; they will instead continue shipping CTP's until the product is ready.<ref name="allchin2">{{web reference|author=Mary Jo Foley|date=2006-01-28|publisher=microsoft-watch.com|publishdate=2006-01-27|url=http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/0,2180,1916296,00.asp|title=Microsoft to Skip Vista Beta 2 }}</ref><br/>+<br/>+==Editions==<br/>+It is [http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_editions.asp rumored] that Windows Vista will ship in nine editions; all of which except for Starter Edition will be in [[32-bit]] and [[64-bit]] versions.

See [[Windows Graphics Foundation]].<br/>+* '''Communications''': the '''[[Windows Communication Foundation]]''' or '''WCF''', formerly code named '''Indigo''': a service-oriented messaging system which allows programs to interoperate locally or remotely similar to [[web service]]s. <br/>+* '''Data''': '''[[WinFX]]''' (not to be confused with "[[WinFS]]"): a new API to allow access to these new features.<br/>+<br/>+WPF, WCF, and WinFX are technologies that Microsoft is hoping to make available to Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 as well, and are therefore not technologies exclusive to Vista, but rather developed in time for the Vista release. Allowing an easier introduction of these technologies to developers and end users may be a reason for [[backporting]] them. However, Aero will still be exclusive to Vista. On March 26, 2005, Microsoft released a Community Preview for both WPF and WCF to enable developers to experiment with the new technologies without running the Alpha version of Vista. Later, due to a proliferation of  requests the preview was made available to the general public at Microsoft's website.<br/>+<br/>+==New features==<br/>+{{expand}}<br/>+{{see|Features new to Windows Vista}}<br/>+<br/>+Windows Vista has a long list of new features, changes, and improvements.  Neither the final feature set nor the extent to which the different editions would contain different features has been fully clarified as of January 2006.<br/>+<br/>+===End-user features===<br/>+* User Account Protection is a new security feature that enables users to perform common tasks with least privilege.<br/>+* [[Aero (user interface)|Aero]]: a re-designed user interface, code-named ''Aero''&nbsp;– an acronym (or [[backronym]]) for ''Authentic, Energetic, Reflective, and Open''. The new interface is intended to be cleaner and more aesthetically pleasing than previous Windows, including new transparencies, animations and [[eye candy]].<br/>+* [[Windows_indexing_service|Search]]: significantly faster and more thorough search capabilities, similar to what is offered by [[Windows Desktop Search]], [[Copernic]], and [[Apple Computer]]'s [[Spotlight (software)|Spotlight]].  Search boxes have been added to the Start menu and Windows Explorer.<br/>+* Windows shell: The new Windows shell is significantly different from Windows XP, offering a new range of organization and [[Windows_indexing_service|search]] capabilities.  The Start menu has changed as well; it no longer uses ever-expanding boxes when navigating through Programs.  Even the word "Start" itself has been removed in favour of a blue Windows "orb".<br/>+* [[Windows Sidebar]]: A new panel on the right-hand side of the screen where a user can place [[Desktop Gadgets|desktop gadgets]].<br/>+* [[Windows Defender]]: Microsoft's Anti-spyware product has been incorporated into Windows, offering protection against [[spyware]] and other threats.  Changes to various system configuration settings (such as new auto-starting applications) are blocked unless the user gives consent.<br/>+* [[Windows Mail]]: A replacement for Outlook Express that includes a new transactional database for better stability and performances in real-time searching and a number of features from [[Microsoft Outlook|Outlook 2003]], most notably [[spam]] filtering and the right-hand reading pane. [http://channel9.msdn.com/showpost.aspx?postid=116711]<br/>+* [[Windows Update]]: Software and security updates has been simplified, now operating solely via a control panel instead of as a web application.  Mail's spam filter and Defender's definitions will also be automatically updated via Windows Update.<br/>+* Vista includes a range of [[parental controls]] to limit when accounts may be used, what programs and web sites are blocked, and monitoring capabilities.<br/>+* [[Speech recognition]] allows Vista to be "trained" to understand a user's voice, to activate commands, and enable voice dictation.<br/>+* [[Internet Explorer]] is upgraded with support for [[tabbed browsing]], [[RSS]], a search box, a [[phishing]] filter, and improved standards support.  [[ActiveX]] controls are disabled by default.  Also, Internet Explorer will operate in a "protected mode" sandbox which operates with lower permissions than the user, preventing it from accessing anything on the user's account. [http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/09/20/471975.aspx]<br/>+* User Account Control is a new security technology that allows Windows to operate effectively as a "standard" user, which was often a difficult thing to do in previous versions of Windows. [http://blogs.msdn.com/uac/]<br/>+* Many new fonts, including several designed especially for screen reading, and a new high-quality Japanese font. See [[:Category:Windows Vista typefaces|Windows Vista typefaces]].<br/>+* The "My" prefix on folder names has been dropped, and "Documents and Settings" has been renamed to "Users".  The "Pictures", "Movies", "Music" etc. folders now reside in the user's main directory, not under "Documents" as in previous versions of Windows.<br/>+* Windows System Assessment Tool (WinSat), a built in benchmarking tool which analyzes the different subsystems (graphics, memory, etc), and uses the results to allow for comparison to other Vista systems, and for software optimizations.<br/>+* [[Windows Calendar]] is a new calendar and task application.<br/>+* [[Windows Photo Gallery]], a photo and movie library management application. WPG can import from digital cameras, tag and rate individual items, adjust colors and exposure, create and display slideshows (with pan and fade effects), and burn slideshows to DVD.<br/>+* Windows DVD Maker, presumed to be a DVD creation application.<br/>+* Windows Collaboration is the replacement for [[NetMeeting]].  Users can share applications (or their entire desktop) with other users on the local network, or over the Internet.<br/>+* Games: Every game included with Windows has been rewritten to take advantage of Vista's new graphics capabilities.  New games include [[Chess]], [[Mahjong solitaire]], and [[Purble Place]].<br/>+* Touch-screen support will be included.<ref>{{web reference|author=Paul Thurrott|date=2006-01-28|publisher=winsupersite.com|publishyear=2006-01-27|url=http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_jimallchin.asp|title=Paul Thurrott interview with Microsoft co-President Jim Allchin}}</ref><br/>+<br/>+===Core technologies===<br/>+Windows Vista is intended to be a technology-based release, to provide a solid base to include advanced technologies, many of which will be related to how the system functions, and hence not too much visible to the user.<br/>+<br/>+* Improved memory manager, processes scheduler and I/O with I/O asynchronous cancellation.

In August 2004, Microsoft announced that WinFS would not be included in Windows Vista. This was due to time constraints in developing the technology, Microsoft will probably release WinFS in 2007 as an update. Microsoft has been [[Cairo (operating system)|working on this technology]] since the mid 1990s.<br/>+* Due to scheduling issues, the '''[[MSH (shell)|Windows Command Shell (MSH)]]''', code-named ''Monad'' will not be included in Windows Vista.

Both Sidebar and WinFS were dropped.<br/>+*'''Milestone 8 and 9:'''<br/>+**Build 5000 made in early to mid September 2004 was notable, as a lot of former code was discarded from the Windows Vista codebase, and work restarted basically from scratch on the [[Windows Server 2003#Service Pack 1|Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1]] codebase. Some features have later been reintroduced again, such as the popular Windows sidebar. Many former Windows Longhorn features will never see the light again in the final version of Windows Vista though, and even Microsoft's actual vision with Vista changed, in many ways to be less ambitious, as testers had started to see already with WinFS being dropped. The huge loss of features in the builds closely following this change, led to an OS closely reminding testers of Windows XP again. These turn of events led well-known Windows enthusiast Paul Thurrott to say the Longhorn development process had the "makings of a train wreck" [http://www.windowsitpro.com/windowspaulthurrott/Article/ArticleID/46175/windowspaulthurrott_46175.html], something from which he now says the Vista development process has recovered in the more recent builds.<br/>+**Build 5048 (2005-04-01) - '''Official WinHEC 2005 preview build.'''

As it stands now it is an almost direct copy of [[Hall]] but the latter has a disambiguation tag put on it so someone will soon by trying to simplify it in the way that for example, [[Bolt]] was treated.

To deem it un-newsworthy when it clearly has received coverage in several newspapers, including Canada's largest daily paper, the ''[[Toronto Star]]'', is to rewrite [[history]]. Is that the purpose of WP? -- to rewrite history? I don't think so. Further, given the widely held reputation of Saugeen as a "fun place" to reside while attending [[UWO]] ([[Google]] Saugeen and see for yourselves 12 pages of "The Zoo's" reputation and memories), this incident adds context. And make no mistake about it. Senior officials at UWO have tried to alter Saugeen's reputation over the years -- effectively banning the use of the nickname "The Zoo." Are there UWO officials on WP trying to squelch this story? Probably not. But I don't think that we should do their dirty work. [[User:Barry Wells|Barry Wells]] 23:52, 8 January 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+It's interesting how two individuals that currently live in Saugeen (see above postings, [[User: The Vince-alator]] and the other user beginning with the letter "O") are strongly opposed to this page and presumably its inclusion in the [[Saugeen-Maitland Hall]] thread. [[User:Barry Wells|Barry Wells]] 00:43, 9 January 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+The real significance of Saugeen-Maitland Hall lies in its history as the first co-ed residence on campus. Originally, in 1969, the men and women were separated -- the men were in the Saugeen portion and all women in the Maitland portion (locked doors between the two sections). The men and women each had their own "Proctor."<br/>+<br/>+Then the men and women were put in alternating "units" (three floors made a "unit") in the respective two sections of the complex. Later still, men and women were put on the same floor. This is the real significance of Saugeen and the various hi-jinks and shenanigans/ memories and reputation of the place is part of that history.

I noticed your reply on El C's page, and I'd like to ask you if you meant all of what you said there. I believe Gmaxwell has a legitimate complaint, on Carnildo's behalf: it's an awfully strong statement to accuse a longtime good-faith contributor of "inciting hate speech against children" without some awfully solid proof, and so a request to retract that in the absence of such proof is not uncalled for. Though I don't know him well, I've never known Carnildo to act to deliberately cause harm to anyone and to say that he was in such a fashion is inappropriate. (Regardless of what anyone else did or didn't do, or was or wasn't blocked for. I know that El C's statement wasn't the only improper statement or action made tonight, but it's one of them.) If you want to discount everything Greg says because you believe he has a history of being unreasonable, that's your prerogative; I don't know how you regard my opinion, but I would make the same request myself. Look, it's an emotional issue. People believe really strongly about these things, tempers run hot. And people say things and do things that aren't in the best of considered thought. But they shouldn't stand after some cooling down has taken place, and asking for them to be reconsidered is not out of line. I suppose I'd just like to ask you to consider your words, because they've caused hurt where they didn't need to.

Did someone say, corgi? ==<br/>+<br/>+I read your note of support and solidarity to [[User:Carbonite|Carbonite's]] page, and thought to look at your user page. Corgi dogs are the best, aren't they? Mine is named Boston and hes 10yrs old. What a dog! Smarter than most of the people I know (IMO). A more loyal and loving pet I have never seen. Anyways, hopefully Carbonite will come back to editing and administrating WP. In the past month or so, I have been watching as a clique of around 10-12 editor/admins attempt to highjack and dominate almost every discussion and debate that deals with article inclusion/deletion, user box use and policy process. Perhaps its always been the same 10-12 individuals and they were just on a bit of a break or something, but its very evident to me in the patterns they follow. Where one comments, the others are not far behind. They are generally savvy and cunning, and experts at gaming the system. My opinion is, give them enough rope to hang themselves and then drop the floor out from under them. WP will survive, even without the "old guard" of policy wonks and JimBo syncophants. Weak leadership is as bad or worse than no leadership. Ok, now that I got that off my chest...Thanks for your words of support to Carbonite. Lets hope they have a positive effect.

It was influenced by [[automobile|car]] culture and the [[Space Age]]. With upswept roofs and, often, curvaceous, [[geometric]] shapes, and bold use of [[glass]], [[steel]] and [[neon]], it decorated many a [[motel]], [[coffee house]] and [[bowling alley]] in the [[1950s]] and 1960s.  It epitomises the spirit a generation demanded, looking excitedly towards a bright, [[technological]] and [[futuristic]] age.  As it became clear that the future would not look like ''[[The Jetsons]]'', the style came to be timeless rather than futuristic.  As with  the [[art deco]] style of the [[1930s]], it has remained undervalued until many of its finest examples had been destroyed. The style is related to and sometimes synonymous with the [[Raygun Gothic]] style as coined by writer [[William Gibson]].<br/>-<br/>-America's preoccupation with space travel had a significant influence on the unique style of Googie architecture. Speculation about space travel had roots going as far back as [[1920s]] [[science fiction]]. In the 1950s, [[space travel]] became a reality for the first time in history. In [[1957]], America's preoccupation grew into an obsession, when the [[Soviet Union]] launched [[Sputnik I]], the first human-made satellite to "break the surly bonds" of the [[Earth's atmosphere]] and "rise unshackled to the dark serene". The obsession intensified into a near mania when the Soviet Union launched [[Vostok 1]] carrying the first human, [[Yuri Gagarin]], into Earth orbit in [[1961]]. The [[Eisenhower]] and [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] Administrations made competing with the Soviets for dominance in space a national priority of considerable urgency and importance. This marked the beginning of "[[The Space Race]]".<br/>-[[Image:58buicklim.jpg|thumb|left|200px|1958 Buick]]<br/>-With space travel such an important part of the national zeitgeist, architects decided that they wanted to give people a little taste of the future in the here and now. Googie style signs usually have something with sharp and bold angles, which suggest the aerodynamic features of a [[rocket ship]] (''ilustration. left''). Also, at the time, the unique architecture was a form of architectural braggadocio, as [[rocket]]s were technological novelties at the time. Perhaps the most famous example of Googie's legacy is the [[Space Needle]] in [[Seattle, Washington]] (''illustration, above right''). A revealing comparison can be made between the Space Needle and the non-Googie [[Osaka Tower]] of [[1956]].<br/>-<br/>-Googie heavily influenced [[retro-futurism]]. The somewhat [[cartoon]]ish style is appropriately exemplified in the [[Jetsons]] cartoons; the original [[Disneyland]] in [[Anaheim, California]] featured a Googie Tomorrowland. Three classic locations for Googie were [[Miami Beach, Florida]], where secondary commercial structures took hints from the resort Baroque of [[Morris Lapidus]] and other [[hotel]] designers, the first phase of [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], and Southern California, where [[Richard Neutra]] built a [[drive-in]] [[church]] in [[Garden Grove, California|Garden Grove]]. <br/>-[[Image:Ships_coffee.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Classic Googie style in this sign from a 1950's era coffee chain in Los Angeles]]<br/>-Eye-catching Googie style flourished in a [[carnival]] atmosphere along multi-lane [[highway]]s, in [[motel]] architecture and above all in [[sign]]age. Private clients were the backbone of Googie, though the Seattle Space Needle qualifies as Establishment Googie. <br/>-<br/>-Cantilevered structures, acute angles, illuminated plastic panelling, freeform [[boomerang]] and artist's palette shapes and cutouts, and tailfins on buildings marked Googie architecture, which was beneath contempt to the architects of [[Modernism]], but found defenders in the [[Post-Modernism|post-Modern]] climate at the end of the [[20th century]].  The common elements that generally distinguish Googie from other forms of architecture are:<br/>-<br/>-<b>Roofs sloping at an upward angle</b> - This is the one particular element in which architects were really showing off, and also creating a unique structure.  Many roofs of Googie style coffee shops, and other structures, have a roof that appear to be 2/3 of an inverted obstuse triangle.  A great example of this is the famous, but now closed, Johnnie's Coffee Shop on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles.  <br/>-<br><br/>-<b>Starbursts</b> - Starbursts are an ornament that goes hand in hand with the Googie style, showing its Space Age and whimsical influences.  Perhaps the most notable example of the starburst appears on the "Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas" sign, which has now become somewhat famous.  <br/>-<br/>-Architecture professor Douglas Haskel (mentioned below) perhaps described the Googie style best saying that "If it looks like a bird, it must be a geometric bird."  Also, the buildings must appear in some cases to defy gravity, as Haskel noted that "whenever possible, the building must hang from the sky."  Also, Googie is not a style noted for its subtlty, as inclusion, rather than minimalism, is one of the central features.  <br/>-[[Image:Lava lamp01.jpg|thumb|left|100px|The [[Lava lamp]], first marketed in 1965, was initially named the "Astro Lamp"]]<br/>-The origin of the name "Googie" is a matter of some speculation amongst enthusiasts.  According to author [[Alan Hess]] in his book "Googie: Fifties Coffee Shop Architecture", he claims that Googie goes back to the late [[1940s]], when architect [[John Lautner]] designed several coffee shops, one by the name of "Googie's", which all had the very distinctive architectural characteristics.  This coffee shop was on the corner of [[Sunset Boulevard]] and Crescent Heights in [[Los Angeles]], but has long since been demolished.  According to Hess, the name "Googie" stuck as a rubric for the architectural style when Professor [[Douglass Haskell]] of Yale and architectural photographer [[Julius Shulman]] were driving through Los Angeles one day.  Haskell insisted on stopping the car upon seeing "Googie's", and proclaimed "This is Googie architecture".  He made the name stick after an article he wrote appeared in a [[1952]] edition of ''[[House and Home]]'' magazine.  <br/>-<br/>-[[Image:laxjetage.jpg|thumb|Los Angeles Airport "Jet-Age" postcard showing the Theme Building.]]<br/>-<br/>-To some, the name Googie has been associated with an architectural style considered to be an aesthetic abomination.  To others though, the Googie style shows how whimsical humor and enthusiasm about the future can be cleverly translated into [[architectural style]], and brings back good memories of a now bygone era.   Ulitmately, the style fell out of favor and, over time, numerous examples of Googie style have either fallen into disrepair or been destroyed completely, usually being replaced with buildings that are functional but lack the kitschy charm of Googie.   <br/>-<br/>-<br/>-The most famous Googie building may be the theme building at [[LAX]] (Los Angeles International Airport) now known as Encounter Restraunt.<br/>-<br/>-==See also==<br/>-* [[Novelty architecture]]<br/>-<br/>-==External links==<br/>-*[http://www.spaceagecity.com/googie/ Googie Architecture Online]<br/>-*[http://www.roadsidepeek.com/googie/ Roadside Peek: Googie Central]<br/>-*[http://dmoz.org/Regional/North_America/United_States/Arts_and_Entertainment/Architecture/Historic_Buildings/Periods_and_Styles/Googie/ Category at ODP]<br/>-* http://www.encounterrestaurant.com/<br/>-* http://googiestyle.blogspot.com/<br/>-<br/>-Preservation groups working to save Googie architecture include<br/>-*http://modcom.org/<br/>-*http://psmodcom.com/<br/>-*http://www.doowopusa.org/<br/>-*http://recentpast.org/<br/>-*http://www.docomomo-us.org/<br/>-*http://www.laconservancy.org/<br/>-*http://www.johnlautner.org/<br/>-<br/>-==Further Reading==<br/>-Learning from Las Vegas, by [[Robert Venturi]], [[1972]]<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-[[Category:Architectural styles]]<br/>-<br/>-[[de:Googie]]<br/>+[[Image:La 24 bg 052204.jpg|thumb|128px|right|[[Kermit the Frog]]'s star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].]]<br/>+The following is a '''list of stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame'''.
