This is believed to be accomplished by traversing the [[axis mundi]] and forming a special relationship with, or gaining control over, [[spiritual being|spirits]].  Shamans have been credited with the ability to control the weather, [[divination]], the interpretation of dreams, [[astral projection]], and traveling to upper and lower worlds.  Shamanistic traditions have existed throughout the world since prehistoric times.<br/>-<br/>-Some anthropologists and religion scholars define a shaman as an intermediary between the natural and spiritual world, who travels between worlds in a trance state. Once in the spirit world, the shaman would commune with the spirits for assistance in healing, hunting or weather management.<br/>-<br/>-Shamanism is based on the premise that the visible world is pervaded by invisible forces or spirits that affect the lives of the living.  In contrast to [[animism]] and [[animatism]], which any and usually all members of a society practice, shamanism requires specialized knowledge or abilities. It could be said that shamans are the experts employed by animists or animist communities. Shamans are not, however, often organized into full-time ritual or spiritual associations, as are [[priest]]s. <br/>-<br/>-==Etymology==<br/>-'''Shaman''' originally referred to the traditional healers of [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]]-[[Mongol]] areas such as [[Northern Asia]] ([[Siberia]]) and [[Mongolia]], a "shaman" being the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]-[[Evenks|Tungus]] word for such a practitioner and literally meaning "he (or she) who knows". In [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] shamans were called mostly ''Kam'' and sometimes ''Baksı''.<br/>-<br/>-The Tungusic word ''šamán'' is from [[Chinese language|Chinese]] ''sha men'' "Buddhist monk," borrowed from Pali ''śamana'', ultimately from [[Sanskrit]] ''śramana'' "ascetic", from ''śramati'' "he fatigues" (see [[shramana]]).  The word passed through Russian and German before it was adopted into English.<br/>-<br/>-Another explanation analyses this [[Tungusic]] word as containing root “''sa-''”, this means “to know”. “Shaman” is “he/she who knows”: a person who is an expert in keeping together the multiple [[code]]s through which this complex belief system appears (p. 15 of <ref name="hop-sameu">Hoppál, Mihály: Sámánok Eurázsiában. Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, 2005.</ref>). The shaman uses (and the audience understands) multiple [[code]]s, because he/she expresses [[meaning]]s in many ways: in musical, verbal, choreographical forms, and [[meaning]]s are manifested also in objects (e.g. [[amulet]]s). The shaman knows the [[culture]] of the community (he/she lives in) well, and acts accordingly. Thus everybody knowns the used [[symbol]]s and [[meaning]]s — that's why shamanism can be efficient: people trust it (p. 26 of <ref name=hop-sameu/>). Such [[belief system]] can appear to its members with certainty of ''[[knowledge]]'' — this explains the above described etymology for the word “shaman” (p. 14 of <ref name="hop-sameu"/>). Hoppál mentions such [[Semiotics|semiotic]] approaches to shamanism also in his other writings ([http://www.folklore.ee/folklore/vol4/hoppal.htm Nature worship in Siberian shamanism]).<br/>-<br/>-Accordingly, the only proper plural form of the word is ''shamans'' and not ''shamen'', as it is unrelated to the English word "man".<br/>-<br/>-In its common usage, it has replaced the older [[English language]] term ''[[witch doctor]],'' a term which unites the two stereotypical functions of the shaman: knowledge of magical and other lore, and the ability to cure a person and mend a situation. However, this term is generally considered to be pejorative and anthropologically inaccurate. Objections to the use of ''shaman'' as a generic term have been raised as well, by both academics and traditional healers themselves, given that the word comes from a specific place, people, and set of practices.<br/>-<br/>-===Criticism of the term "Shaman"===<br/>-Certain anthropologists, most notably [[Alice Kehoe]] in her book "Shamans and Religion: An Anthropological Exploration in Critical Thinking", are highly critical of the term. Part of this criticism involves the notion of [[cultural appropriation]]. This includes criticism of New Age and modern Western forms of Shamanism, which may not only misrepresent or 'dilute' genuine indigenous practices but do so in a way that, according to Kehoe, reinforces subtly racist ideas such as the [[Noble Savage]].<br/>-<br/>-Kehoe is highly critical of [[Mircea Eliade]]'s work. Eliade, being a historian rather than an anthropologist, had never done any field work or made any direct contact with 'shamans' or cultures practicing 'shamanism'. According to Kehoe, Eliade's 'shamanism' is an invention synthesized from various sources unsupported by more direct research. To Kehoe, what Eliade and other scholars of shamanism treat as being definitive of shamanism, most notably drumming, trance, chanting, entheogens and hallucinogenics, spirit communication and healing, are practices that 1) exist outside of what is defined as shamanism and play similar roles even in non-shamanic cultures (such as the role of chanting in Judeo-Christian rituals) 2) in their expression is unique to each culture that uses them and cannot be generalized easily, accurately or usefully into a global 'religion' such as shamanism. Because of this, Kehoe is also highly critical of the notion that shamanism is an ancient, unchanged, and surviving religion from the Paleolithic.<br/>-<br/>-(see also [[Plastic shaman]])<br/>-<br/>-==History==<br/>-Shamanistic practices are sometimes claimed to predate all organized religions, and certainly date back to the [[Neolithic]] period. Aspects of shamanism are encountered in later, organized religions, generally in their mystic and symbolic practices.  Greek paganism was influenced by shamanism, as reflected in the stories of [[Tantalus]], [[Prometheus]], [[Medea]], and [[Calypso]] among others, as well as in the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]], and other mysteries. Some of the shamanic practices of the Greek religion later merged into the Roman religion. <br/>-<br/>-The shamanic practices of many cultures were marginalized with the spread of [[monotheism]] in [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]]. In [[Europe]], starting around 400, the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] was instrumental in the collapse of the Greek and Roman religions. Temples were systematically destroyed and key ceremonies were outlawed or appropriated. The Early Modern [[witch trials]] may have further eliminated lingering remnants of European shamanism. <br/>-<br/>-The repression of shamanism continued as Catholic influence spread with Spanish [[colonialism|colonization]]. In the [[Caribbean]], and [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]], Catholic priests followed in the footsteps of the [[Conquistadors]] and were instrumental in the destruction of the local traditions, denouncing practitioners as "devil worshippers" and having them executed. In North America, the [[English people|English]] [[Puritans]] conducted periodic campaigns against individuals perceived as witches. More recently, attacks {{cite needed}}on shamanic practitioners have been carried out at the hands of Christian [[missionaries]] to [[third world]] countries. As recently as the nineteen seventies, historic [[petroglyphs]] were being defaced by [[missionary|missionaries]] in the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]]. A similarly destructive story can be told of the encounter between [[Buddhists]] and shamans, e.g., in [[Mongolia]] (See Caroline Humphrey with Urgunge Onon, 1996). <br/>-<br/>-Today, shamanism, once possibly universal, survives primarily among [[indigenous people]]s.  Shamanic practice continues today in the tundras, jungles, deserts, and other rural areas, and also in cities, towns, suburbs, and shantytowns all over the world.  This is especially widespread in Africa as well as South America, where "[[mestizo]] shamanism" is widespread.<br/>-<br/>-==Europe==<br/>-While shamanism had a strong tradition in Europe before the rise of monotheism,  shamanism remains as a traditional, organized religion only in [[Mari-El]] and [[Udmurtia]], two semi-autonomous provinces of [[Russia]] with large [[Finnic]] minority populations.<ref>{{cite news <br/>- |author = Staff writer<br/>- |title = The dying fish swims in water<br/>- |work = [[The Economist]]<br/>- |url = http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=5323735<br/>- |pages = 73-74<br/>- |date = December 24 2005 - January 6 2006<br/>-}}</ref><br/>-<br/>-==Asia==<br/>-There is a strong shamanistic influence in the [[Bön]] religion of some [[Central Asian]]s, and in [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. Buddhism became popular with shamanic peoples such as the [[Tibetans]], [[Mongol]]s and [[Manchu]] beginning in the eighth century. Forms of shamanistic ritual combined with [[Tibetan Buddhism]] became institutionalized as the state religion under the [[China|Chinese]] [[Yuan dynasty]] and [[Qing dynasty]]. According to some, one common element of shamanism and Buddhism is the attainment of spiritual realization, at times mediated by [[entheogen]]ic (psychedelic) substances.  However, in the shamanic cultures still practiced by various ethnic groups in areas such as Nepal and northern India, shamans are not necessarily considered enlightened, and often are even feared for their ability to use their power to carry out malicious intent.<br/>-<br/>-In Tibet, the Nyingma schools in particular, had a Tantric tradition that had married 'priests' known as Ngakpas or Ngakmas/mos (fem.). The Ngakpas were often employed or commissioned to rid the villages of demons or disease, creations of protective amulets, the carrying out of religious rites etc. The Ngakpas were often looked down upon by Tibetan hierarchs in the monasteries. The monasteries, as in many conventional religious institutions, wished to preserve their own traditions, sometimes at the expense of others. The monasteries depended upon the excesses of patrons for support. This situation often led to a clash between the more grassroots and shamanic character of the travelling 'Chodpa' & 'Ngakpa' culture and the more conservative religious monastic system.(''Economy of Excess'', George Bataille)<br/>-<br/>-Shamanism is still practiced in [[Korea]], where shamans are known as "mudang", in the [[Ryukyu Islands]], where shamans are known as "nuru", and in a few rural areas in Japan proper. It is generally believed that the [[Shinto]] religion is the result of the transformation of a shamanistic tradition into a state religion{{citation needed}}.<br/>-<br/>-==Americas==<br/>-[[Image:White indian conjuror.jpg|thumb|250px|Native American "conjuror" in a 1590 engraving]]<br/>-In [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] groups, only the shaman had the power to commune with the spirits, to [[Mediation|mediate]] between them and ordinary mortals, to talk with the [[soul]]s on behalf of the living. The shaman, man or woman, was often an extraordinary character, both in physical appearance and in acting talents. He would be a [[Mysticism|mystic]], [[poet]], [[Wise Old Man|sage]], healer of the sick, guardian of the [[tribe]], and the repository of stories. Those who did not possess the full range of the shamanistic attributes became simply "medicine men", and functioned as respected healers. Healing was one of the most important roles of the shaman, and he or she was expected to learn herbal healing methods, as well as spiritual ones. To become a shaman, a person had to "receive the call", to suffer a religious experience, and would then be initiated into the mysteries of the art. By symbolic death and resurrection, he acquired a new mode of being; his physical and mental frame underwent a thorough change. During this period of initiation, the novice would see the spirits of the universe and leave his body like a spirit, soaring through the heavens and underworld. There he would be introduced to the different spirits and taught which to address in future trances. According to [[Mircea Eliade]]'s book "Shamanism", during the initiation, spirits would take the shaman's old bones and replace them with new ones. Since sickness was thought to be caused by an evil spirit entering the victim's body, the shaman would call it out in order to affect a cure. He would do so by a special ritual, beating a rhythm on his drum, swaying and chanting steadily increasing the sound and interspersing it with long drawn out sighs, groans, and hysterical laughter.<br/>-[[Image:Urarina_shaman_B_Dean.jpg|thumb|right|Urarina [[shaman]], 1988]] <br/>-<br/>-<br/>-===Initiation and learning===<br/>-In the world's Shamanic cultures, the shaman plays a priest-like role; however, there is an essential difference between the two, as [[Joseph Campbell]] describes:<br/>-:"The priest is the socially initiated, ceremonially inducted member of a recognized religious organization, where he holds a certain rank and functions as the tenant of an office that was held by others before him, while the shaman is one who, as a consequence of a personal psychological crisis, has gained a certain power of his own." (1969, p. 231)<br/>-<br/>-A shaman may be initiated via a serious illness, by being struck by lightning and dream of thunder and become a [[Heyoka]], or by a near-death experience (e.g., the shaman Black Elk), or one might follow a "calling" to become a shaman. There is usually a set of cultural [[imagery]] expected to be experienced during shamanic initiation regardless of the method of induction. According to [[Mircea Eliade]], such ''imagery'' often includes being transported to the spirit world and interacting with the beings inhabiting the distant the world of [[spirit]]s, meeting a spiritual guide, being devoured by some being and emerging transformed, and/or being "dismantled" and "reassembled" again, often with implanted [[amulet]]s such as magical [[crystals]]. The imagery of initiation generally speaks of ''transformation'' and the granting powers to transcend [[death]] and [[rebirth]].<br/>-<br/>-In some societies shamanic powers are considered to be inherited, whereas in others places of the world shamans are considered to have been "called" and require lengthy training.  Among the Siberian [[Chukchis]] one may behave in ways that "Western" [[bio-medical]] clinicians would perhaps characterize as psychotic, but which Siberian peoples may interpret as [[possession]] by a spirit who demands that one assume the shamanic vocation.  Among the [[South America]]n [[Tapirape]] shamans are called in their [[dreams]]. In other societies shamans choose their career. In North America, First Nations peoples would seek communion with [[spirits]] through a "vision quest"; whereas South American [[Shuar]], seeking the power to defend their family against enemies, apprentice themselves to accomplished shamans. Similarly the [[Urarina]] of Peruvian [[Amazonia]] have have an elaborate cosomoligcal system predicated on the [[ritual]] consumption of [[ayahuasca]]. Coupled with milleanrian impulses, Urarina [[ayahuasca]] shamanism is a key feature of this poorly documented society[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urarina].<br/>-<br/>-Putatively ''customary'' shamanic "traditions" can also be noted among [[indigenous]] [[Kuna]] peoples of [[Panama]], who rely on shamanic powers and [[sacred]] [[talisman]]s to heal. As such, they enjoy a populkr postition among local peoples.<br/>-<br/>-===Shamanic illness===<br/>-Shamanic illness, also called shamanistic inititatory crisis, is a psycho-spiritual crisis, or a rite of passage, observed among those becoming shamans. The episode often marks the beginning of a time-limited episode of confusion or disturbing behavior where the shamanic initiate might sing or dance in an unconventional fashion, or have an experience of being "disturbed by spirits". The symptoms are usually not considered to be signs of mental illness by interpreters in the shamanic culture; rather, they are interpreted as introductory signposts for the individual who is meant to take the office of shaman (Lukoff et.al, 1992). The significant role of initiatory illnesses in the calling of a shaman can be found in the detailed case history of Chuonnasuan, the last master shaman among the Tungus peoples in Northeast China (Noo and Shi, 2004).<br/>-<br/>-===Practice and method===<br/>-The shaman plays the role of healer in shamanic societies; shamans gain knowledge and power by traversing the [[axis mundi]] and bringing back knowledge from the heavens.  Even in western society, this ancient practice of healing is referenced by the use of the [[caduceus]] as the symbol of medicine.  Oftentimes the shaman has, or acquires, one or more familiar helping entities in the spirit world; these are often spirits in animal form, spirits of healing plants, or (sometimes) those of departed shamans.  In many shamanic societies, magic, [[Odic force|magical force]], and knowledge are all denoted by one word, such as the [[Quechua]] term "''yachay''".<br/>-<br/>-While the causes of disease are considered to lie in the spiritual realm, being effected by malicious spirits or [[witchcraft]], both spiritual and physical methods are used to heal.  Commonly, a shaman will "enter the body" of the patient to confront the spirit making the patient sick, and heal the patient by banishing the infectious spirit.  Many shamans have expert knowledge of the plant life in their area, and an herbal regimen is often prescribed as treatment.  In many places shamans claim to learn directly from the plants, and to be capable of harnessing their effects and healing properties only after obtaining permission from its abiding or patron spirit.  In South America, individual spirits are summoned by the singing of songs called [[icaros]]; before a spirit can be summoned the spirit must teach the shaman its song.  The use of [[totem]] items such as rocks is common; these items are believed to have special powers and an animating spirit.  Such practices are presumably very ancient; in about 368 BCE, [[Plato]] wrote in the ''[[Phaedrus]]'' that the "first prophecies were the words of an oak", and that everyone who lived at that time found it rewarding enough to "listen to an oak or a stone, so long as it was telling the truth".<br/>-<br/>-The belief in witchcraft and sorcery, known as [[brujeria]] in South America, is prevalent in many shamanic societies.  Some societies distinguish shamans who cure from sorcerers who harm; others believe that all shamans have the power to both cure and kill; that is, shamans are in some societies also thought of as being capable of harm.  The shaman usually enjoys great power and prestige in the community, and is renowned for their powers and knowledge; but they may also be suspected of harming others and thus feared.<br/>-<br/>-By engaging in this work, the shaman exposes himself to significant personal risk, from the spirit world, from any enemy shamans, as well as from the means employed to alter his state of consciousness.  Certain of the plant materials used can be fatal, and the failure to return from an out-of-body journey can lead to physical death. Spells are commonly used to protect against these dangers, and the use of more dangerous plants is usually very highly ritualized.<br/>-<br/>-===Shamanic technology===<br/>-Generally, the shaman traverses the [[axis mundi]] and enters the spirit world by effecting a change of consciousness in himself, entering into an [[Religious ecstasy|ecstatic]] [[altered state of consciousness|trance]], either [[autohypnotically]] or through the use of [[entheogen]]s.  The methods used are diverse, and are often used together.  Some of the methods for effecting such altered states of consciousness are:<br/>-<br/>-*[[Drumming]]<br/>-*[[Singing]]<br/>-*[[Fasting]]<br/>-*Listening to [[music]]<br/>-*[[Sweat lodge]]<br/>-*[[Vision quests]] / [[vigil]]s<br/>-*[[Dancing]]<br/>-*Use of "power" or "master" plants to induce altered states or aromatics used as incense such as<br/>-**[[Ayahuasca]] - ''[[Quechua]]'' for ''Vine of the Dead''; also called ''[[yage]]''<br/>-**[[Cannabis (drug)|Cannabis]]<br/>-**[[Cedar]]<br/>-**[[Datura]]<br/>-**[[Deadly nightshade]]<br/>-**[[Amanita muscaria|Fly agaric]]<br/>-**[[Iboga]]<br/>-**[[Morning glory]]<br/>-**[[Peyote]]<br/>-**[[Psychedelic mushrooms]] - alluded to euphemistically as ''holy children'' by [[Mazatec shamans]] such as [[Maria Sabina]].''<br/>-**[[Sweetgrass]]<br/>-**[[Common sage|Sage]]<br/>-**[[Salvia divinorum]] - sometimes called ''Diviners' sage''<br/>-**[[San Pedro (cactus)|San Pedro cactus]] - named after ([[St. Peter]]), guardian and holding the keys to the gates of heaven, by the [[Andes|Andean]] peoples; [[Quechua]] name: Huachuma<br/>-**[[Tobacco]] <br/>-<br/>-Shamans will often observe dietary or customary restrictions particular to their tradition. Sometimes these restrictions are more than just cultural. For example, the diet followed by shamans and apprentices prior to participating in an [[Ayahuasca]] ceremony includes foods rich in [[tryptophan]] (a biosynthetic precursor to [[serotonin]]) as well as avoiding foods rich in [[tyramine]], which could induce [[hypertensive crisis]] if ingested with [[MAOI]]s such as are found in Ayahuasca brews.<br/>-<br/>-===Gender and sexuality===<br/>-Most shamans are men, but there are societies in which women may be shamans. In some societies, shamans exhibit a [[two-spirit]] identity, assuming the dress and attributes of the opposite sex from a young age, for example, a man taking on the role of a wife in an otherwise ordinary marriage. This practice is common, and found among the [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]], [[Sea Dyak]], [[Patagonians]], [[Araucanians]], [[Arapaho]], [[Cheyenne]], [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]], [[Pawnee]], [[Lakota]], and [[Ute (tribe)|Ute]], as well as many other Native American tribes. Indeed, these two spirited shamans were so widespread as to suggest a very ancient origin of the practice.  See, for example, [[Joseph Campbell]]'s map in his [[The Historical Atlas of World Mythology:]] [Vol I: The Way of the Animal Powers: Part 2: pg 174]  Such two-spirit shamans are thought to be especially powerful, and Shamanism so important to ancestral populations that it may have contributed to the maintenance of genes for transgenered individuals in breeding populations over evolutionary time through the mechanism of "kin selection." [see final chapter of E.O. Wilson's "Sociobiology: The New Synthesis]   They are highly respected and sought out in their tribes, as they will bring high status to their mates.<br/>-<br/>-In [[Korea]], almost all of the shamans are female.<br/>-<br/>-Duality and bisexuality are also found in the shamans of the Dogon people of Mali (Africa).  References to this can be found in several works of Malidoma Some, a writer who was born and initiated there.<br/>-<br/>-==Shamanism and New Age movement==<br/>-The [[New Age]] movement has appropriated some ideas from shamanism as well as from Eastern religions. As in other such imports, the original users of these ideas frequently condemn New Age use as misunderstood superficially understood and/or applied[http://www.aics.org/war.html].<br/>-<br/>-At the same time, there is an endeavor in [[occultism|occult]] and [[esotericism|esoteric]] circles to reinvent shamanism in a modern form, drawing from [[core shamanism]], a set of beliefs and practices synthesized by [[Michael Harner]] and often revolving around the use of ritual drumming and dance; various indigenous forms of shamanism, occasionally focusing on the ritual use of [[entheogens]]; as well as [[chaos magic]].  Much of this is focused upon [[Europe]], where ancient shamanic traditions were suppressed by the Christian church and where people compelled to be shamans often find it improper to use shamanic systems rooted in other parts of the earth.  Various traditional shamans express respect for this endeavor, sharply distinguishing it from "light (weight)" New Age shamanism. Some anthropologists and practitioners have discussed the impact of such "[[neoshamanism]]" as 'giving extra pay' (Harvey, 1997 and elsewhere) to indigenous shamanisms, particularly as many pagan- or heathen-'shamanic practitioners' call themselves by specific names derived from older European traditions - the [[völva]] or seidkona ([[seid]]-woman) of the sagas being an example (see Blain 2002, Wallis 2003).<br/>-<br/>-Sometimes, however, people from Western cultures claim atually to be shamans, often associated with either the New Age or [[Neopaganism|Neopagan]] movements.  This is considered offensive by many indigenous practitioners, who view these New Age, Western "shamans" as hucksters out for money or affirmation of self.  Many shamanistic cultures feel there is a danger that their voices will be drowned out by self-styled "shamans," citing, for example, the fact that [[Lynn Andrews]] has sold more books than all Native American authors put together.<br/>-Often too, these New Age Shamans (sometimes called [[Plastic shaman]]s), make up elaborate ceremonies that are often completely fraudulent (such as [[Sweat lodge]] ceremonies, or [[Chuluaqui-Quodoushka]]).  Others may be based on real traditional ceremonies but reproduced in a way that distorts, or commercializes, their meaning. <br/>-At the same time, dealing with the phenomenon of the "self-styled" New Age shamans, one should exercise caution. If religious and spiritual practices are based on the appropriation of other people's cultures or even contain elements of deceit, this does not automatically make them less valid than the "traditional."  Strictly speaking, in matters of religion/spirituality, such labels as "traditional " and "non-traditional," "indigenous" and "non-indigenous" do not make sense.<br/>-<br/>-==See also==<br/>-*[[Neurotheology]] &mdash; speculation regarding the biological basis of spirituality and spiritual practices<br/>-*[[Shaman's Drum Journal]]<br/>-*[[Core Shamanism]]<br/>-*[[Manna]]<br/>-*[[Ayahuasca]]<br/>-*[[Peyote]]<br/>-<br/>-==Notes==<br/>-<references/><br/>-<br/>-==Further reading==<br/>-*Blain, Jenny, ''Nine Worlds of Seid-Magic: Ecstasy and neo-Shamanism in North European Paganism.'' 2002.

Raw shark fins are processed by first removing the skin, trimming them to shape, and thoroughly drying them. Bleaching with [[hydrogen peroxide]] may be employed before drying to make the colour of the sharks fin more appealing. Shark fins are the [[cartilage|cartilaginous]] pectoral and dorsal fins of a shark.<br/> <br/>-See also:<br/>-<!-- something like this would make sense[[:Category:Films of Russia in other languages]], --><br/>-*[[:Category:Russian-language films|Russian-language films]]<br/>-*[[:Category:Soviet films|Soviet films]]<br/>-*[[:Category:Russian Empire films|Russian Empire films]]<br/>-*[[:Category:Russian Federation films|Russian Federation films]]<br/>+Fresh shark fin is rarely used in cuisine, and is almost always used in dried form. Dried shark fin is prepared by first reconstituting in clear meat stock made from either Chinese dried [[ham]] or chicken. Fins are then cooked through simmering in a rich stock with similarly rich and high priced ingredients. This is done for no more then an hour in order to preserve the shark fin's texture and shape. It is then served as rich soup or stew, usually as a main course. Individual shark fin ”needles“ can be described as having a texture somewhere between soft [[rubber]] and hard [[agarose]] jelly, with the flexibility of the former and the slight brittle "crunch" of the latter. When a whole fin is eaten, the binding tissue combined with the needles softens the needles' otherwise rubbery impact. Shark fin itself does not have much flavour though it may hold a slight fishy fragrance. It is for these reasons that flavourful stocks and ingredients are used to enhance the flavour of shark fin.<br/> <br/>-[[Category:Films by culture]]<br/>-[[Category:Cinema of Russia|Films]]<br/>-[[Category:Arts in Russia|Films]]<br/>-[[Category:Russian-language films|Russia]]<br/>+Considered a highly prized delicacy, the best shark fin soup can fetch up to US$100 per bowl. Where they are in high demand like in [[Hong Kong]], genuine sharks' fins from sought-after species such as the [[Hammerhead shark|Hammerhead]] (''Sphyrna'' spp.), [[Mako Shark|Mako]] (''Isurus'' spp.), and [[blue shark]] (''Prionace'' spp.) can sell for [[US$]]400 per kilogram. However, there are also cheaper shark fins, usually taken from smaller shark species, used for casual dining. The quantities used for each bowl of soup may vary from a few needles of fin rays (typical in a US $150 Chinese feast), to a whole small fin, or even more. The price depends on the size and quality of shark fin used; shark fin is estimated to cost at least US $4.50 per bowl.<br/>+<br/>+Shark fin is the third most prized ingredient of the four treasures of the sea in [[Chinese cuisine]]. The others are [[abalone]] (which is always the most expensive), [[sea cucumber]] (varies in cost), and finally, dried [[scallop]]s (known as [[conpoy]]) or [[gas bladder|fish maw]].<br/>+<br/>+==Pseudo-shark fin==<br/>+There is an imitation version are usually sold as cans that may simply be labeled as shark-fin soup (in most cases preceded by the word "imitation" on the product label), and sells for around US $1.50 per bowl. It does not contain shark-fins, but instead is made of [[Cellophane noodles|mung bean vermicelli]] shaped to resemble shark fins, though they are nowhere equivalent to genuine shark fin in either texture or color. It is commonly served in chicken broth, with culinary fungus and pork to enhance the texture and taste.<br/>+<br/>+==Controversy==<br/>+According to [[wildlife conservation]]ists, much of the sharks' fins in the trade are cut from living sharks; this process is called '''finning'''. Because shark meat is worth very little, the finless and often still-living sharks are thrown back into the sea to make room for more of the valuable fins. When returned to the [[ocean]], the finless sharks, unable to move, die from suffocation or are eaten by other sharks or animals. Also, many times fishermen who are looking for tuna find the sharks and fin them. Finning is vigorously opposed by [[animal welfare]] groups; both on moral grounds and also because it is purportedly a major cause for the rapid decline of global shark [[population]]s, in some cases by 99% over the last 50 years, leading [[conservation ecology|conservation ecologists]] and [[fishery]] experts to predict widespread shark [[extinction]] in 10 or 20 years. An estimated 100 million sharks are slaughtered each year for their fins, and the industry is valued at 1.2 billion US dollars; because of the lucrative profits, there are allegations of links to organized crime. They also raise questions on the medical harm from the consumption of high levels of toxic [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] reportedly found in shark fins. <br/>+<br/>+In countries such as [[Thailand]] and [[Singapore]], public awareness advertisements on finning have reportedly reduced consumption by 25%. In Hong Kong, the oldest chain of restaurants specializing in shark fin soup has reportedly closed, citing lobbying by the animal rights groups as one of the main reasons. <br/>+<br/>+New laws have been passed to prevent finning; though much of the [[international waters]] continue to be unregulated. The [[United States]] recently issued a ban on finning, applicable only to US-registered vessels, even in US territorial waters; and shark fins cannot be imported into the USA without entire carcasses. International fishing authorities are in the process of banning shark fishing (and finning) in the [[Atlantic ocean]] and [[Mediterranean Sea]].  However shark fishing and finning continues unabated in the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] and [[Indian ocean]].<br/>+<br/>+Large-scale removal of [[shark]]s may severely unbalance the [[ecosystem]] of warm seas by allowing some species of large or middle-sized fish to multiply or grow bigger: for an example see [[grouper]].<br/>+<br/>+[[NBA]] star [[Yao Ming]] pledged to stop eating shark fin soup at a news conference on August 2, 2006.<br/>+<br/>+==External links==<br/>+*[http://www.pbs.org/kqed/oceanadventures/getinvolved/links.html Links to Shark Conservation and Protection Organizations]<br/>+*[http://www.sharkfriends.com/sharkfinning.html SharkFriends Shark Finning Page]<br/>+*[http://members.fortunecity.com/makan1/sharkfinsoup.htm Mock Shark's Fin Soup] &ndash; Recipe for alternative shark fin soup with imitation "shark fin".<br/>+*[http://www.chattergarden.com/node/860 Stop Consuming Shark Fins]<br/>+*{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/05/international/americas/05sharks.html|title=Hidden Cost of Shark Fin Soup: Its Source May Vanish|date=[[January 5]], [[2006]]|publisher=The New York Times}}<br/>+*[http://msn.foxsports.com/other/story/5840720?FSO1&ATT=HMA NBA Star swears off shark fin soup]<br/>+<br/>+== References ==<br/>+Baum J.K., Myers R.A., Kehler D.G., Worm B., Harley S.J., Doherty P.A.

Today, Turkey might be the only country that contains every extreme depiction of east and west culture and many in between grey tones. From the cultural view point, [[balkanization]] was the end of Ottoman Empire. Turkish Republic adapted a unitary approach, which was forcing all the different cultures within its boarders to mix with each other under the name of Turkish. The mixing, instead of assimilation is the end result of many grey tones. 80 years of transformation undeniably produced many grey colors of east-west duality. These pictures should be taken as a proof achievement of Turkish democracy as a cauldron of ideas and representations.<br/> <br/>-'''[[Tagline]]''': ''Music was his passion. Survival was his masterpiece''.<br/>+The main periods are divided by decades. Because of the loading time of the pictures, each decade has its own page.<br/> <br/>-==Plot summary==<br/>-{{spoiler}}<br/>-Władysław Szpilman, a famous Polish Jewish pianist working for [[Warsaw]] radio,<!--should this be changed to the correct official name? perhaps capitalize the "r" or omit the "the"?--> sees his whole world collapse with the outbreak of [[World War II]] and the [[Polish September Campaign|Invasion of Poland]] in September, [[1939]]. After the radio station at which he was working is rocked by explosions, Szpilman goes home to learn on the radio that [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] and France have declared war on [[Germany]]. Believing the war will end quickly, he and his family rejoice at this news and wonder when all of this will be over.<br/>+== History ==   <br/>+The country of Turkey has been the site of wide variety of empires and has literally been a crossroads for much of [[Eurasia]]. Some of the earliest known inhabitants include the [[Hattians]] also known as [[Hatti]]s, 2500-2000 BCE, who were quite possibly an aboriginal people of Anatolia. They were followed by the [[Hittites]], 2000-1750 BCE, an [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] people from the steppes of modern [[Russia]] and the [[Ukraine]], who merged with the local population. Later invaders included [[Phrygians]], [[Lydians]], [[Assyrians]],[[Persians]] [[Urartu|Urartians]], [[Armenians]], [[Kurds]], [[Greeks]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Galatians]], [[Byzantines]], [[Mongols]], [[Arabs]] and of course [[Turkic peoples|Turkic tribes]]. Most, if not all, of these groups contributed to the modern identity of the Turks, although to varying degrees.<br/> <br/>-Two years go by and living conditions for the Jewish people gradually deteriorate as their rights are slowly eroded: they now have a limited amount of money permitted per family, armbands imprinted with the Star of David to identify themselves, and eventually, late in 1941, they are all forced into the [[Warsaw Ghetto]]. There, they face hunger, persecution and humiliation from the [[Nazis]] and the ever present fear of death or torture. Before long, they are rounded up for deportation to [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]]. At the last moment, Szpilman is saved from this gruesome fate by a family friend. Now, separated from his family and loved ones, he survives, at first in the Ghetto as a slave laborer for German reconstruction units and later in hiding outside, relying on the help of non-Jews who still remember him.<br/>+Ultimately, the linguistic and cultural contribution of the Turkic tribes cannot be ignored. The [[Oghuz Turks|Oğuz]] were the main Turkic people who moved into Anatolia after 1072 CE. Small bands of Turks began their migration following the victory of the [[Seljuks]], led by [[Alp Arslan]], against the [[Byzantines]] at the [[Battle of Manzikert]] and this paved the way for Turkish dominance in Anatolia. This also marked the beginning of the decline of the Byzantine empire. In the centuries after Manzikert, the relatively small number of Turkic immigrants began to assimilate local populations as their numbers grew. Anatolia was an ethnic mosaic, a region with a wide variety of peoples, but dominated by the Greek-speaking Byzantines (who were themselves Hellenized Anatolians) and other prominent regional groups such as Armenians, Kurds, and others. Anatolia had become a major center of Christianity since the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Niceae]] and the process of Christianization started by the Roman emperor [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]] had long since established eastern Christianity in the region by the time of Turkic ascendency. The majority of the people were adherents of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] church, but there were many adherents of other Christian churches or syncretist movements, as well as [[Jews]] and the [[Zoroastrian]] and [[Christian]] Kurds. Over time, as word spread regarding the victory of the Turks in Anatolia, more Turkic [[ghazi]]s arrived from the Caucasus, [[Arab]] lands and Central Asia. These groups in turn merged with the local inhabitants as a slow process of conversion to Islam took place, thanks in large measure to the efforts of the [[sufis]], that helped to bolster the Turkish-speaking population. While most historians believe that the actual migration of Turks was relatively small, genetic testing has revealed that as much as 30% of Turks have varying degrees of Central Asian ancestry.[http://www.ias.ac.in/jgenet/Vol83No1/039.pdf] Although, result of another genetic testing suggests that the actual Central Asian ancestry could be less than 9%[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=14586639&dopt=Abstract].  The genetic constitution of the Turks today is much closer to their nearest geographic neighbors like Iranians and Lebanese, although none is a Turkic-language population, than to the Turkic-speaking populations of Central Asia [http://hpgl.stanford.edu/publications/PNAS_2001_v98_p10244.pdf][http://www.assyrianfoundation.org/genetics.htm].<br/> <br/>-When living in hiding, he witnesses many horrors committed by the Nazis such as widespread killing, beating, and burning. In one memorable scene he witnesses the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising|Uprising]] by the Jews from the Ghetto. In the end the Germans forcibly enter the [[Warsaw Ghetto|Ghetto]] and kill nearly all the remaining fighters. <br/>+== The Modern Turks ==<br/>+Ultimately, it is absurd to speak of any ‘Turkish race’ in the tangled ethnic web of Anatolia. Race as a genetic-based social category that is in any case a concept of the XIXth century, is no longer accepted by most social scientists. The Turks have successfully assimilated a wide variety of peoples and many reject any ethnic or ancestral distinctions. One Turkish saying clarifies this view, "We Turks resemble ourselves." As such, official Turkish history relates the population as derived from [[Oghuz Turks]], although in recent years many historians have put forth the possibilities of long forgotten ancestors such as the [[Hittites]] as well. <br/> <br/>-A year goes by and life in Warsaw has further deteriorated. The [[Armia Krajowa|Polish resistance]] mounts another unsuccessful [[Warsaw Uprising|Uprising]] against the German occupation. Warsaw was virtually [[Aftereffects of the Warsaw Uprising|levelled and depopulated]] as a result. On more than one occasion, Szpilman has come near to death. Now, miserable and weak, he is more likely to starve to death than to die by at the hands of the Nazis. <br/>+As a matter of fact, most present-day Turks are the offspring of all sorts of populations whose original languages have sometimes been extinct several centuries ago. <br/>+Among the Black Sea Turkish intellectuals there has been a revival of interest for the forgotten ethnic and religious identities of many ancestors who feared to pass on any non-Turkish or non-Muslim traditions to their children due to fear of a reprisals. The Encyclopedic Dictionary of Black Sea website based on the research by [[Özhan Öztürk]], but also the books of [[Ömer Asan]] and Selma Koçiva (see also her site[http://www.lazuri.com/], only in [[Turkish (language)|Turkish]] and [[Laz language]]s) are good illustrations of this trend, unthinkable 5 years ago and still under attack of (right- and left-wing) Turkish nationalists who label it as pure "national treason" and "betrayal of [[Atatürk]]'s heritage".<br/> <br/>-Searching the ruins of a bombed-out house, Szpilman tries to find something to eat. After a frantic search, he finds a can of pickled cucumbers. Unfortunately, he does not have a can-opener with which to open it. After another search, he finds some fireplace tools and tries to open the can. Just as he starts, he realizes he is being watched by a German officer. The German officer is named Captain [[Wilm Hosenfeld]], and he immediately intuits<!--this word seems anachronistic but I can't think of anything better--> that Szpilman is a Jew. He asks what he is doing, and Wladyslaw meekly answers that he is trying to find something to eat. He also says that he is a pianist, and Hosenfeld leads him to a piano and asks him to play something. In a moving scene, we see the decrepit Szpilman, only a shadow of the flamboyant pianist he once was, perform [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]]'s despairing "Ballade in G minor" before a surprisingly empathic Hosenfeld. After finishing the piece, a touched Hosenfeld hides him in the attic of the building. Hosenfeld regularly brings him food so he can survive. Szpilman cannot believe his luck.<br/>+There have also been through the XIXth and XXth centuries, and still nowadays, rumors of the existence, mostly in rural and small town areas, of large populations of Crypto-Christians and Crypto-Jews, notably among the [[Dönme]], descendents of [[Sabbatai Zevi]]'s followers who had to convert en masse following Zevi's example.<br/> <br/>-Another few weeks go by, and the Germans are forced to withdraw from Warsaw due to the advancing [[Vistula-Oder Offensive|Red Army]] troops. Before leaving the area, Hosenfeld asks Szpilman what his name is, and, upon hearing it, remarks that it is apt for a pianist. Hosenfeld also promises to listen for Szpilman on Polish radio. Hosenfeld gives Szpilman his coat and leaves with his company. The coat nearly proves fatal for Szpilman when Soviet troops, liberating what remains of Warsaw, mistake him for a German officer and shoot at him. He is able to convince them that he is Polish and they stop shooting. When harshly asked why he's wearing a German officer's coat, the haggard Szpilman simply replies, "I'm cold."<br/>+The Turks of Turkey can be broken down into a variety of segments and the majority of self-identifying Turks include four main groupings:  [[Rumelia]]n Turks who are mostly of [[Balkan]] origin, [[Anatolia]]n Turks who compose the bulk of ethnic Turks found in Anatolia, [[Central Asia]]n Turks who remain a large segment of the population that has been moving to Turkey for centuries, and [[Eurasia]]n Turks from [[Russia]] and the [[Caucasus]] such as the [[Tatars]] and [[Azerbaijanis]]. These Turks share similar languages and cultures, while individual Turks may identify with distinct parentage as well such as being part-[[Circassians|Circassian]] or part-[[Arab]], etc.<br/> <br/>-When a nearby concentration camp is liberated, Captain Hosenfeld and other Germans are captured. Hosenfeld begs a passing Jewish prisoner, a musician, to contact Szpilman to free him. Szpilman, who has gone back to playing live on Warsaw radio, arrives at the site too late; all the prisoners have been removed along with any trace of the stockade. In the movie's final scene, Szpilman triumphantly performs Chopin's "Grand [[Polonaise]] Brillante in E flat major" to a large audience in Warsaw. Title cards shown just before the end credits tell us that Szpilman died in 2000 and Hosenfeld in 1952 in a Soviet [[prisoner-of-war camp]].<br/>+== Turkish phenotypes and diversity ==<br/>+While the majority of Turks do bear a common brunette [[Mediterranean]] appearance similar to that of neighboring countries, there are large visible exceptions that are a testament to the legacy of population movements into the region. People walking in a Turkish street or watching a Turkish movie can see Turks of about all physical types prevalent in the country, from the blond haired and-blue-eyed to the Asiatic Mongol individuals, and even people with some partial black African roots, from the times when the Ottoman Empire stretched into [[Sudan]]. Turkey, like so many other vast former imperialist powers such as the Romans and the British, in part reflects its imperial past.<br/> <br/>-== Production ==<br/>-[[Image:ThePianist1.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Brody with Polański on the set in Warsaw, Poland.]]Principal photography on ''The Pianist'' began on [[February 9]], [[2001]] in Babelsberg Studios in [[Germany]]. The filming of the movie required the re-creation of the Warsaw Ghetto and the surrounding city. Although the war left the city in ruins, most of it had been rebuilt with very few parts of it suitable for filming. On the [[backlot]] of Babelsberg Studios the streets of Warsaw were re-created as they would have looked during the war. Old Soviet army barracks were used to create the ruined city, as they were going to be destroyed anyway. <br/>+Proving the difficulty of classifying ethnicities living in Turkey, there are as many classifications as the number of scientific attempts to make these classifications. Turkey is not a unique example for that and many European countries (e.g. France, Germany) bear a similar ethnic diversity. So, the immense variety observed in the published figures for the percentages of Turkish people living in Turkey (ranging from 75 to 97%) totally depends on the method used to classify the ethnicities. Complicating the matter even more is the fact that the last official and country-wide classification of spoken languages (which do not exactly coincide with ethnic groups) in Turkey that was performed in 1965 and many of the figures published after that time are remain static estimates.<br/>+It is necessary to take into account all these difficulties and be cautious while evaluating the ethnic identity of the Turks of Turkey. A possible comprehensive list of ethnic origins for Turks living in Turkey could be as follows (based on the classification of P.A. Andrews (1), however this book is more like a review and depends on other people's publications):<br/> <br/>-The first scenes of the film were shot at the old army barracks and soon after moved to a villa in Potsdam, Germany, which served as the house where Szpilman meets Hosenfeld. On [[March 2]], 2001 filming then moved to an abandoned Soviet army hospital in [[Belitz, Germany]]. Here the scenes where the Germans destroy the hospital with flame throwers was filmed. On March 15 filming finally moved to Babelsberg Studios. The first scene shot at the studio was the scene Szpilman witnesses a mounted resistance by the Jews from the Ghetto, which is eventually ended by the Nazis. The scene was complex and technically demanding as it involved various stunts and [[explosives]]. Filming at the studios ended on [[March 26]] and moved to Warsaw on [[March 29]]. The rundown district of [[Praga]] was chosen for filming because of its abundance of original buildings. The art department built on to these original buildings, re-creating World War II&ndash;era Poland with signs and posters from the period. Additional filming also took place around Warsaw. The [[Umschlagplatz]] scene where Szpilman, his family and hundreds of other Jews wait to be taken to the concentration camps was filmed at a local Military Academy. <br/>-<br/>-Principal photography ended in July 2001, and was followed by months of post-production, which took place in Paris, France, where Polański was born and now resides.<br/>-<br/>-==Cast & crew==<br/>-*[[Adrien Brody]] - [[Wladyslaw Szpilman]]<br/>-*[[Thomas Kretschmann]] - Captain [[Wilm Hosenfeld]]<br/>-*[[Frank Finlay]] - Father<br/>-*[[Maureen Lipman]] - Mother<br/>-*[[Emilia Fox]] - Dorota<br/>-*[[Ed Stoppard]] - Henryk<br/>-*[[Julia Rayner]] - Regina<br/>-*[[Jessica Kate Meyer]] - Halina<br/>-*[[Michal Zebrowski]] - Jurek<br/>-<br/>-==Trivia==<br/>-* "Szpilman", is pronounced exactly like the [[German language|German]] "Spielmann", a word meaning [[band (music)|band]]sman or player, hence Hosenfeld's remark that it was an appropriate name for a pianist.<br/>-* The piano piece heard at the beginning of the film is Chopin's [[Nocturne]] in C-sharp minor (Op. posth.)<br/>-* The piano piece played when Szpilman is confronted by Hosenfeld is Chopin's Ballade No. 1 in G minor, Opus 23.

Hofstadter]], first published in ''[[Harper's]]'' magazine in [[November]] [[1964]]. Written at a time when [[Senator]] [[Barry Goldwater]] had won the [[Republican_Party_%28United_States%29|Republican]] Presidential nomination over the more moderate [[Nelson A. Rockefeller]], Hofstadter's article explores the influence of [[conspiracy theory]] and "movements of suspicious discontent" throughout [[American history]].<br/>+[[Image:Amrita Sher-Gil Painting on India Today Cocer.JPG|thumb|250px|A painting by Amrita Sher-Gil on the cover of [[India Today]]. The painting was sold in 2006 for USD 1.5 million]]<br/> <br/>-==Themes==<br/>-===The paranoid style as a recurring theme in American political history===<br/>-Hofstadter begins by noting that:<br/>-<blockquote><br/>-American politics has often been an arena for angry minds. In recent years we have seen angry minds at work mainly among extreme right-wingers, who have now demonstrated in the Goldwater movement how much political leverage can be got out of the animosities and passions of a small minority. But behind this I believe there is a style of mind that is far from new and that is not necessarily right-wing. I call it the paranoid style simply because no other word adequately evokes the sense of heated exaggeration, suspiciousness, and conspiratorial fantasy that I have in mind.<br/>-</blockquote><br/>+'''Amrita Sher-Gil''' ( [[30th January]] [[1913]], [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]] – [[5th December]] [[1941]], [[Lahore]]), was an eminent Indian painter. She was daughter of Umrao Singh Sher-Gil Majithia, a Sikh aristocrat, and Marie Antoinette Gottesmann, a Hungarian, who was a singer. Sher-Gil was the elder of two daughters born to Umrao Singh and Marie Antoinette. Her younger sister was Indira Sundaram (neé Sher-Gil). <br/> <br/>-Hofstadter goes on to detail historical paranoia directed against [[Illuminism]], [[Freemasonry]], and the [[Jesuit]]s, and follows this strain in American politics through what he considered its modern incarnations in [[McCarthyism]] and the activities of the [[John Birch Society]].<br/>+She was trained as a painter in [[Italy]] and [[Paris]], at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] and drew inspiration from European painters such as [[Paul Cézanne]] and [[Paul Gauguin]], while coming under the influence of her teacher [[Lucien Simon]] and the company of artist friends and lovers like [[Boris Tazlitsky]]. Her early paintings display a significant influence of the Western modes of painting, especially as being practised in the bohemian circles of Paris in the early 1930s. Sher-Gil returned to India in 1934 and began a rediscovery of the traditions of Indian art which was to continue till her death. She was greatly impressed and influenced by the schools of [[Mughal miniatures]] and the [[Ajanta]] paintings. She toured South India and produced the famous South Indian trilogy paintings, that reveal her passionate sense of colour and an equally passionate empathy for her Indian subjects, who are often depicted in their poverty and despair. Her work also shows an engagement with the works of [[Hungarian painters]] in the interwar years, especially the [[Nagybanya]] school of painting.<br/> <br/>-===The paranoid style defined===<br/>-Hofstadter describes the unifying characteristics of the paranoid politican thus:<br/>-<blockquote><br/>-The paranoid spokesman sees the fate of conspiracy in apocalyptic terms — he traffics in the birth and death of whole worlds, whole political orders, whole systems of human values. He is always manning the barricades of civilization... he does not see social conflict as something to be mediated and compromised, in the manner of the working politician. Since what is at stake is always a conflict between absolute good and absolute evil, what is necessary is not compromise but the will to fight things out to a finish. Since the enemy is thought of as being totally evil and totally unappeasable, he must be totally eliminated — if not from the world, at least from the theatre of operations to which the paranoid directs his attention. This demand for total triumph leads to the formulation of hopelessly unrealistic goals, and since these goals are not even remotely attainable, failure constantly heightens the paranoid’s sense of frustration. Even partial success leaves him with the same feeling of powerlessness with which he began, and this in turn only strengthens his awareness of the vast and terrifying quality of the enemy he opposes.<br/>-</blockquote><br/>+Sher-Gil married her Hungarian first cousin, Dr. Victor Egan in 1938, and moved with him to India, to stay at her paternal family's home in Saraya, [[Uttar Pradesh]]. The couple later moved to [[Lahore]] then in undivided [[India]], and a major cultural and artistic centre. She was also famous for her many affairs with both women and men. Sher-Gil died in 1941, but the real reason for death has never been ascertained, something expected in view of the overly sensationalised accounts of Amrita's life in the words of her contemporaries. A failed abortion and peritonitis have been suggested as the possible causes. <br/> <br/>-===Emulating the enemy===<br/>-Hofstadter also notes the element of [[psychological projection]] inherent in the paranoid style of politics. That is,<br/>-<blockquote><br/>-It is hard to resist the conclusion that this enemy is on many counts the projection of the self; both the ideal and the unacceptable aspects of the self are attributed to him. The enemy may be the cosmopolitan intellectual, but the paranoid will outdo him in the apparatus of scholarship, even of pedantry. Secret organizations set up to combat secret organizations give the same flattery. The Ku Klux Klan imitated Catholicism to the point of donning priestly vestments, developing an elaborate ritual and an equally elaborate hierarchy. The John Birch Society emulates Communist cells and quasi-secret operation through "front" groups, and preaches a ruthless prosecution of the ideological war along lines very similar to those it finds in the Communist enemy. Spokesmen of the various fundamentalist anti-Communist "crusades" openly express their admiration for the dedication and discipline the Communist cause calls forth.<br/>-</blockquote><br/>+The Government of India has declared her works as National Art Treasures, and most of them are housed in the [[National Gallery of Modern Art]] in [[New Delhi]].<br/> <br/>-The article also notes that "sexual freedom" is a vice often attributed to the paranoid politican's enemy, and notes that "very often the fantasies of true believers reveal strong sadomasochistic outlets, vividly expressed, for example, in the delight of anti-Masons with the cruelty of Masonic punishments." In recent times, this observation can be applied to a number of right-wing exemplars of the paranoid political style who have turned out to exemplify some of the same purported sexual vices which they rail against (e.g. [[Bill O'Reilly]], [[Newt Gingrich]], [[Randy "Duke" Cunningham]], [[Strom Thurmond]], [[Roy Cohn]], [[Jimmy Swaggart]], [[Jim Bakker]], [[David Dreier]], [[Ed Schrock]], [[Rush Limbaugh]], [[James E.

(If you edit without a username, your [[IP address]] is used to identify you instead.)<br/>+In Ireland and in Wales, the language of the inscriptions of this period is termed [[Primitive Irish]]. The transition to [[Old Irish]], the language of the earliest sources in the Latin alphabet, takes place in  about the 6th century. Since Ogham inscriptions consist almost exclusively of personal names, linguistic information that may be glimpsed from the Primitive Irish period is mostly restricted to [[phonology|phonological]] developments. From phonological evidence, it is clear that the alphabet predates the 5th century. A period of writing on wood or other perishable material prior to the preserved monumental inscriptions needs to be assumed, sufficient for the loss of the phonemes represented by ''[[úath]]'' ("H") and ''[[straif]]'' ("Z"), as well as the voiced labiovelar, ''[[gétal]]'', all of which are clearly part of the system, but unattested in inscriptions. This evidence points to a creation not post-dating the [[4th century]]. A possible origin, as suggested by McManus (1991:41), is the early Christian community known to have existed in Ireland from around AD [[400]] at the latest, the existence of which is attested by the mission of [[Palladius]] by [[Pope Celestine I]] in AD [[431]]. Palladius died and was buried at [[Auchenblae]] in the [[Mearns]] in eastern [[Scotland]]. These events may be associated with a Christian community there propagating Ogham to the otherwise anomalous cluster of inscriptions in eastern Scotland. Another possiblility would be 4th century Irish colonies in [[History of Wales|Wales]] who came into contact with the Latin alphabet. <br/> <br/>-*When using [[Wikipedia:talk pages|talk pages]], please [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|sign your name]] at the end of your messages by typing four tildes (~&#126;~~).

Again, welcome!<br/>+It is clear that the Ogham alphabet was modelled on another script, and some even consider it a mere cipher of its template script (Düwel 1968:{{fact}} points out similarity with [[Cipher runes|ciphers]] of Germanic runes). The largest number of scholars favours the [[Latin alphabet]] as this template, although the [[Elder Futhark]] and even the [[Greek alphabet]] have their supporters. Runic origin would elegantly explain the presence of "H" and "Z" letters unused in Irish, as well as the presence of vocalic and consonantal variants "U" vs. "W" unknown to Latin or Greek writing. The Latin alphabet is the main contender mainly because its influence at the required period (4th century) is most easily established, viz., via [[Roman_Britain#The_fourth_century|Britannia]], while the runes in the 4th century were not very widespread  even in continental Europe.<br/> <br/>-Thank you again for contributing to Wikipedia.

''[[Auraicept na n-Éces]]'', and other Medieval [[Irish folklore]], Ogham was first invented soon after the fall of the [[Tower of Babel]], along with the [[Gaelic language]], by the legendary [[Scythian]] king, [[Fenius Farsa]]. According to the Auraicept, Fenius journeyed from [[Scythia]] together with Goídel mac Ethéoir, Íar mac Nema and a retinue of 72 scholars. They came to the plain of [[Shinar]] to study the [[confusion of tongues|confused languages]] at [[Nimrod]]'s tower (the [[Tower of Babel]]). Finding that they had already been dispersed, Fenius sent his scholars to study them, staying at the tower, coordinating the effort. After ten years, the investigations were complete, and Fenius created  ''in Bérla tóbaide'' "the selected language", taking the best of each of the confused tongues, which he called ''Goídelc'', [[Goidelic]], after Goídel mac Ethéoir. He also created extensions of ''Goídelc'', called ''Bérla Féne'', after himself, ''Íarmberla'', after Íar mac Nema, and others, and the ''Beithe-luis-nuin'' (the Ogham) as a perfected writing system for his languages. The names he gave to the letters were those of his 25 best scholars. <br/> <br/>-== Warnings ==<br/>+Alternatively, the [[Ogam Tract]] credits [[Ogma|Ogma mac Elathan]] ([[Ogmios]]) with the script's invention. Ogma was skilled in speech and poetry, and created the system for the learned, to the exclusion of rustics and fools. The first message written in Ogam were seven ''b'''s on a birch, sent as a warning to [[Lugh|Lug mac Elathan]], meaning: "your wife will be carried away seven times to the otherworld unless the birch protects her". For this reason, the letter ''b'' is said to be named after the birch, and ''In Lebor Ogaim'' goes on to tell the tradition that all letters were named after trees, a claim also referred to by the Auraicept as an alternative to the naming after Fenius' disciples.<br/> <br/>-Please do not add commentary or your own personal analysis to Wikipedia articles, as you did to [[:Primerica Financial Services]].

Each aicme was named after its first character (''Aicme Beithe'', ''Aicme hÚatha'', ''Aicme Muine'', ''Aicme Ailme'', "the B Group", "the H Group", "the M Group", "the A Group").

They were first discussed by [[Roderic O'Flaherty]] ([[1685]]), who took them at face value. The Auraicept itself is aware that not all names are known tree names, saying "Now all these are wood names such as are found in the Ogham Book of Woods, and are not derived from men", admitting that "some of these trees are not known today". The Auraicept gives a short verse for each letter, identifying the plant. Only four of the twenty primary letters have names that the Auraicept considers comprehensible without glosses, namely ''beith'' "birch", ''fearn'' "alder", ''saille'' "willow" and ''duir'' "oak". All the other names are glossed or "translated" with a plant name. McManus (1991, §3.15) discusses possible etymologies of each name. The "Tree Alphabet" idea dates to the [[Old Irish]] period (say, [[10th century]]), but it post-dates the Primitive Irish period, or at least the time when the letters were originally named. Its origin is probably due to the letters themselves being called ''feda'' "trees", or ''nin'' "forking branches" due to their shape. Since a few of the letters were, in fact, named after trees, the interpretation arose that they were called ''feda'' because of that. Some of the names had fallen out of use as independend words, and were thus free to be claimed as "Old Gaelic" tree names, while others (such as ''ruis'', ''úath'' or ''gort'') were more or less forcefully re-interpreted as epitheta of trees by the medieval glossators.<br/>+<br/>+*'''Beith''', Old Irish '''Beithe''' means "[[birch]]-tree"<br/>+*'''Luis''', Old Irish '''Luis''' is either related to ''luise'' "blaze" or ''lus'' "herb". The arboreal tradition has ''caertheand'' "[[rowan]]".<br/>+*'''Fearn''', Old Irish '''Fern''' means "[[alder]]-tree", Primitive Irish ''*wernā'', so that the original value of the letter was [w]. <br/>+*'''Sail''', Old Irish '''Sail''' means "[[willow]]-tree", cognate to Latin ''salix''.<br/>+*'''Nion''', Old Irish '''Nin''' means either "fork" or "loft". The arboreal tradition has ''uinnius'' "[[ash-tree]]".<br/>+*'''Uath''', Old Irish '''Úath''' means  ''úath'' "horror, fear", the arboreal tradition has "[[white-thorn]]". The original etymology of the name, and the letter's value, are however unclear. McManus (1986) suggested a value [y]. Peter Schrijver (see McManus 1991:37) suggested that if ''úath'' "fear" is cognate with Latin ''pavere'', a trace of PIE ''*p'' might have survived into Primitive Irish, but there is no independent evidence for this.<br/>+*'''Dair''', Old Irish '''Dair''' means "[[oak]]" (PIE ''*doru-'').<br/>+*'''Tinne''', Old Irish '''Tinne''' from the evidence of the kennings means "bar of metal, ingot". The arboreal tradition has ''cuileand'' "[[holly]]".<br/>+*'''Coll''', Old Irish '''Coll''' meant "[[hazel]]-tree", cognate with Welsh ''collen'', correctly  glossed as ''cainfidh'' "fair-wood" ("hazel") by the arboreal interpretation.<br/>+*'''Ceirt''', Old Irish '''Cert''' is cognate with Welsh ''pert'' "bush" , Latin ''quercus'' "oak" (PIE ''*perkwos''). It was confused with Old Irish ''ceirt'' "rag", reflected in the kennings. The Auraicept glosses  ''aball'' "[[apple]]".<br/>+*'''Muin''', Old Irish '''Muin''': the kennings connect this name to three different words, ''muin'' "neck, upper part of the back", ''muin'' "wile, ruse", and ''muin'' "love, esteem". The arboreal tradition has  ''finemhain'' "[[vine]]".<br/>+*'''Gort''', Old Irish '''Gort''' means "field" (cognate to ''garden''). The arboreal tradition has ''edind'' "[[ivy]]".<br/>+*'''nGéadal''', Old Irish '''Gétal''' from the kennings has a meaning of "killing", maybe cognate to ''gonid'' "slays", from PIE ''{{PIE|gwen-}}''. The value of the letter in Primitive Irish, then, was a voiced labiovelar, [g<sup>w</sup>]. The arboreal tradition glosses ''cilcach'', "[[broom (plant)|broom]]" or "[[fern]]".<br/>+*'''Straif''', Old Irish '''Straiph''' means "sulphur". The Primitive Irish letter value is uncertain, it may have been a sibilant different from ''s'', which is taken by ''sail'', maybe a reflex of /st/ or /sw/. The arboreal tradition glosses  ''draighin'' "[[blackthorn]]".<br/>+*'''Ruis''', Old Irish '''Ruis''' means "red" or "redness", glossed as ''trom'' "[[elderberry|elder]]".<br/>+*'''Ailm''', Old Irish '''Ailm''' is of uncertain meaning, possibly "pine-tree". The Auraicept has ''crand giuis .i. ochtach'', "[[fir]]-tree" or "[[pinetree]]".<br/>+*'''Onn''', Old Irish '''Onn''' means "[[ash-tree]]", although the Auraicept glosses ''aiten''  "[[furze]]".<br/>+*'''Úr''', Old Irish '''Úr''', based on the kennings, means "earth, clay, soil". The Auraicept glosses ''fraech'' "heath".<br/>+*'''Eadhadh''', Old Irish '''Edad''' and '''Iodhadh''', Old Irish '''Idad''' are paired names of unknown meaning. The Auraicept  glosses  ''crand fir  no crithach'' "test-tree or aspen",  and  ''ibhar'' "[[Taxaceae|yew]]", respectively.<br/>+<br/>+Of the ''[[forfeda]]'', four are glossed by the Auraicept, '''Eabhadh''', Old Irish '''Ebhadh''' with ''crithach'' "aspen"; '''Ór''', Old Irish '''Oir''' with ''feorus no edind'' "spindle-tree or ivy"; <br/>+'''Uilleann''', Old Irish '''Uilleand''' with ''edleand'' "honeysuckle"; and '''Ifín''', Old Irish '''Iphin''' with  ''spinan no ispin'' "gooseberry or thorn".<br/>+<br/>+==Unicode==<br/>+The Ogham alphabet is allotted [[Unicode]] range U+1680 &ndash; U+169F (as of version 4.1).

Still Brahmins enjoy a unique place in the Hindu society. Brahmins welcomed these people who truly represent the spirit of [[Brahman]] in this world.

The lake was created by [[Bristol Water]] (Bristol Waterworks Company as it was known then), when it dammed the [[River Yeo (Congresbury Yeo)|River Yeo]], starting construction in 1891 and completing this in 1899. The [[Wrington Vale Light Railway]] was constructed primarily to bring building materials for the lake.<br/> <br/>+The lake, which was originally called the '''Yeo reservoir''', covers 440 acres (1.78 km²). The lake is relatively shallow, with an average depth of 14 feet and only 42 feet at its deepest point near the dam (west end of the lake). The eastern end is the shallowest where the River Yeo enters.<ref>{{cite web | title=Blagdon Lake | work=Bristol Waters | url=http://eis.bris.ac.uk/~cckhrb/BW/blagdon.htm | accessdate=2006-07-08}}</ref> When full it contains 8,456 million litres and supplies 9,547 million litres of water each year, and works closely with its larger neighbour [[Chew Valley Lake]].<br/>+__TOC__<br/>+{{clear}}<br/> <br/>-  Attention: What you're about to post probably doesn't belong here.<br/>+==Pumping station and Visitor Centre==<br/>+[[Image:Blagdonlake1.jpg|thumb|Blagdon Lake from Blagdon Village]]<br/>+Blagdon Pumping Station and Visitor Centre includes science and environment exhibits and hands-on displays as well as a room dedicated to the charity [[WaterAid]].

Outside this is space for picnics and a nature trail.<br/> <br/>-  Before you add to this page click back and review the help for the appropriate section for your post.<br/>+When the lake first opened there were four Woolf compound rotative beam pumping engines, housed in two separate buildings. They were built by Glenfield & Kennedy of [[Kilmarnock]] between 1900 and 1905. Each beam engine had an output of 170[[Horsepower|hp]] at 17[[Revolutions per minute|rpm]]. The HP cylinders were supplied by steam from Lancashire [[Boiler]]s at 100[[Pound-force per square inch|psi]]. Three engines with a fourth on standby could pump 7.5 million [[gallon]]s of [[water]] a day, whilst the boilers consumed 8.5 tons of [[coal]] per day. They ran until 1949, when two engines from the north engine house were replaced by electric pumps.<ref>{{cite web | title=Blagdon Pumping Station visit | work=Histalec News | url=http://www.swehs.co.uk/docs/news09.html#item08 | accessdate=2006-07-07}}</ref><br/>+[[Image:Blagdonlake2.jpg|thumb|Blagdon Lake]]<br/>+In 1984 it was decided to preserve the two remaining engines and incorporate them as the central feature in the Visitor Centre, including a Museum in the old boiler house, which opened in 1988 and attracts over 30,000 visitors a year.

Aspect ratios vary slightly, but the fact that all images are either 100px wide or 100px tall (or both) creates a pleasant sense of uniformity.<br/>-<br/>-:Of course, we can make exceptions for images with unusual aspect ratios.

That's why it's separated into the six sections like that and "errors" is repeated in each box.

It might attract more people to become Users. 2. Like it or not, one of the best things about Wikipedia is its breath of coverage. Of course quality is important - no-one is denying that - but quantity is not a "dirty word" and for regular Users to see Wikipedia's expansion for themselves, every time they come to the site, is a great confidence- and morale- (and ego-) booster. The idea that having 1.4 million articles is "bad" in some way, that we might want to kind of "hide" it, is plainly ridiculous. We should be proud of it. 3. Like it or not, when media outlets want to write a story on Wikipedia, many will be lazy and their "research" will be to go to the Main Page. Yes, they could scroll down and see the number there, but again many just will not. As I said above, we should be proud of the number of articles we have, and we want it to be reported as widely as possible. Hence, it should be pride of place at the top of the Main Page.

[[User:Sven Erixon|Sven Erixon]] 12:03, 23 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-:While there is nothing wrong with letting new users see the current number of articles, placing that number at the top of the main page says something fundamental about Wikipedia's priorities: quantity of articles is the most important aspect of Wikipedia.  During the site's early days creation of new content was very important but now that there are well over a million articles, with a thousand or more new articles created each day, the need to create new articles just to have content has passed.  Instead, the development of encyclopedic quality articles needs to become at least as important as the importation of new content.  This change in direction from emphasizing quantity to considering quality to be just as important requires an adjustment in the project's culture.  Removing the advertisement at the top of the main page that emphasizes quantity over quality is part of the needed cultural change, and as such should be viewed as a necessary evil. --''[[User: Allen3|Allen3]]''&nbsp;<sup>[[User talk:Allen3|talk]]</sup> 14:15, 23 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-::[edit conflict]Responding to Batmanand: 1) I didn't realize that we were trying to "sell itself"; I thought we were trying to make a better encyclopedia. And why is it "important"?  I imagine that a casual user would be most interested in if a particular topic is covered, not that he/she could get to 50,000 other articles in two clicks.  2) I am a regular user and my ego is not boosted.  An increase from 400K to 500K is amazing; 1.2 million to 1.3 million, not so much.  It's not so much "bad", as you phrase it, as not particularly interesting.  3) Ummm... you want to cater to "media outlets" that won't click on the invitingly bold [[Wikipedia]]?  <br/>-<br/>-::The ticker was added back when Wikipedia was encouraging editors to churn out articles and reach a level of parity in coverage with Brittanica, etc.  (See [http://nostalgia.wikipedia.org/wiki/HomePage the Main Page in December 2001].) Then we spent a while being pleased we had more articles than Brittanica.  Now it's just unsporting to compare number of articles.  If the best argument that can be made for the ticker is that it has always been there and it gives some users warm fuzzies to see a number that is so large that it hardly bears comparison, that's a pretty weak argument.  <br/>-::Going back to the post that kicked this discussion off, the number of FAs is not impressive, which is the reason to use it, if anything.  When Wikipedia was bending its efforts to cover major topics, it openly acknowledged that it needed more articles.  The ticker at that point was clearly a "editing help requested" notice rather than a "we rule!" proclamation.  If insufficient breadth is no longer a concern and attention is now on improving the quality and sourcing of articles, it would be entirely within the norms of the project to put up a number based on quality.  The two current quality rating systems, obviously designated subjectively [[Wikipedia talk:What is an article?#Moved from Talk:Main Page|as is "article"]], are [[WP:FA]] and [[WP:GA]].  If the number of GAs was much larger than of FAs, an argument could be made for using the bigger number.  It is not and a featured article ticker is the likelier candidate.  I am not particularly attached to this idea and am fine with the ticker being removed from the top altogether.  However, there is an argument to be made for a switch rather than a removal. - [[User talk:BanyanTree|BT]] 14:27, 23 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-:::A key difference between the article count and the "featured article"/"good article" counts is that the former is an objective (albeit relatively irrelevant) statistic.

Your claim that the reference to quantity is "just a number" is about as sound as the claim that evolution is "just a theory".

In other languages they usually have a short introduction to Wikipedia, where they can fit the article count. I don't know why would you debate about this in therms of quality and quantity; I don't think these are really opposites. In fact, quantity and size are forms or quality for many (perhaps most) people. Well I've spent pretty much of my study time talking about this, something that nobody really cares about, hehe.

The breadth of our coverage is still a major selling point, and I favor keeping the prominent reference.  I can't see how including it or not has any impact on editors, so I must assume it is mostly a public relationship move, i.e. we don't want people thinking about how big we are, because we want people to focus on our quality.  But that is silly since removing reference to our breadth (a good point) does nothing to actually improve our actual article quality.

It looks like some are saying that the article count only serzed its purpose when the English version was small and now it's not needed anymore. I think that's fine '''as long as every wikipedia has reached a million articles'''. Let's not forget that the English version is often the template for others, and other wikipedias often just follow the English version out of habit. For all we know in a few weeks a new language will start its own Wikipedia and say "welcome to Wikipedia in language X. The end." with nothing about the article count and therefore much less motivation to contribute. Then later on if other wikipedias start to follow along the article count on the front will start to look like something that small wikipedias do to try to make themselves look bigger, etc. IOW I don't see any reason for the change, and we should always keep in mind the effect on other language editions as well.

Keating]] took four cesium-beam [[atomic clocks]] aboard commercial airliners and flew twice around the world, first eastward, then westward, and compared the clocks against those of the [[United States Naval Observatory]].<br/>+{{Marxist theory}}<br/>+'''Surplus product''' (German: ''Mehrprodukt'') is a concept explicitly theorised by [[Karl Marx]] in his critique of [[political economy]]. Notions of "surplus produce" have been used in economic thought and commerce for a long time, but Marx gave the concept a central place in his interpretation of economic history. <br/> <br/>-==Overview==<br/>+Marx divides the "social product" of [[society]]'s [[labour force]] into the ''necessary product'' and the ''surplus product''. The necessary product refers to the output necessary to maintain a population of producers and their dependents at the prevailing standard of life. The surplus product is whatever is produced in excess of those necessaries. <br/> <br/>-According to [[special relativity]], the speed of a clock is greatest according to an observer who is not in motion with respect to the clock. In a frame of reference in which the clock is not at rest, the clock runs slower, and the effect is proportional to the square of the velocity. In a frame of reference at rest with respect to the center of the earth, the clock aboard the plane moving eastward, in the direction of the earth's rotation, is moving faster than a clock that remains on the ground, while the clock aboard the plane moving westward, against the earth's rotation, is moving slower.<br/>+In producing, people must maintain their assets, replace assets, and consume things (productive consumption and final consumption) but they also can create more beyond those requirements, assuming sufficient productivity of labour.<br/> <br/>-According to [[general relativity]], another effect comes into play: the slight increase in gravitational potential due to altitude that speeds the clocks back up. Since the aircraft are flying at roughly the same altitude in both directions, this effect is more "constant" between the two clocks, but nevertheless it causes a difference in comparison to the clock on the ground.<br/>+This social surplus product can be <br/> <br/>-The results were published in ''Science'' in [[1972]]:<br/>-<table class="wikitable"><tr><td rowspan=3><th colspan=4>[[nanosecond]]s gained<br/>-<tr><th colspan=3>predicted<th rowspan=2>measured<br/>-<tr><th>gravitational<br>([[general relativity]])<th>kinematic<br>([[special relativity]])<th>total<br/>-<tr><th>eastward<td>144±14<td>-184±18<td>-40±23<td>-59±10<br/>-<tr><th>westward<td>179±18<td>96±10<td>275±21<td>273±7</table><br/>+*destroyed, or wasted<br/>+*held in reserve, or hoarded <br/>+*consumed <br/>+*traded <br/>+*reinvested (accumulated)<br/> <br/>-The published outcome of the experiment was consistent with special relativity, and the observed time gains and losses were reportedly different from zero to a high degree of confidence.<br/>+If the surplus product is simply held in reserve, wasted or consumed, no economic growth (or enlarged economic reproduction) occurs. Only when the surplus is traded and/or reinvested, does it become possible to increase the scale of production. <br/> <br/>-That result was contested by Dr. Kelly who examined the raw data: he found that the final published outcome had to be averaged in a biased way in order to claim such a high precision. Also [[Louis Essen]], the inventor of the atomic clock, published an article in which he discussed (in his opinion) the inadequate accuracy of the experiment. <br/>+For example, surplus seeds could be left to rot, stored, eaten, traded for other products, or sown on new fields. But if for example 90 people own 5 sacks of grain, and 10 people own 100 sacks of grain, it is physically impossible for those 10 people to use all that grain themselves - most likely they would either trade that grain, or employ other people to farm it.<br/> <br/>-On the 25th anniversary of the original experiment, in what was claimed to be its repetition with using more precise atomic clocks, the results were allegedly verified to an even higher degree of accuracy. [http://www.npl.co.uk/publications/metromnia/issue18/]. Note however that this does not mean the proof of the two theories.<br/>+The existence of a surplus product assumes the ability to perform [[surplus labour]], i.e. labour beyond that which is necessary to maintain society at the existing standard of life. <br/> <br/>-==GPS==<br/>+In Marx's view, all economising reduces to the economy of human labour-time. The greater human [[productivity]] is, the more time there is  - potentially - to produce more than is necessary to simply reproduce the population. Alternatively, that extra time can be devoted to leisure, but who gets the leisure and who gets to do the extra work is usually strongly influenced by the prevailing [[power (sociology)|power]] and [[moral]] relations, not just economics.<br/> <br/>-It is often mistakenly reported that SR and GR theories are critical in operating the NAVSTAR GPS navigation system. However, GPS was never designed to utilize or test either of the two theories. Upon insisting by some relativity physicists in the late 1990-ies, GPS navigation and control messages were included immeasurably small corrections in addition to the originally pre-programmed position corrections (as due to the atmospheric, signal-multipath and other effects). Without explanation however, and in a manner that is not entirely transparent, the relativity physics community has recently started using this correction as a proof for the two relativity theories.<br/>- <br/>-In fact, the so-called "GPS relativistic correction" is too small to be measured on Earth using even the most precise (geodetic) GPS techniques so-called differential positioning (DGPS), also called the relative or geodetic GPS positioning. Thus in his classical book [http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0471059307/sr=1-2/qid=1156085902/ref=sr_1_2/102-7705539-2972104?ie=UTF8&s=books GPS Satellite Surveying], Alfred Leick writes (p.170): "In relative (mm) positioning, most of the relativistic effects cancel or become negligible." This is because the relativity-predicted values, if real, would amount to less than one half of the normal environmental (insurmountable) geophysical noise. Therefore, geometrical differencing in precise positioning cancels out most of the so-called "relativistic effects"; the GPS system can perform equally superb without SR or GR theories. Hence no known (scientific or commercial) GPS receiver seems to utilize the so-called "GPS relativistic correction".<br/>- <br/>-The above-cited Leick's book is considered by some to be one of the most authoritative sources on GPS geodesy nowadays. It also lists numerous references that show in greater detail why the so-called "relativistic effects" turn out to be irrelevant for achieving the highest (millimetre-level) obtainable accuracy in precision positioning. Similarly, non-geodetic (navigation) accuracy would not suffer to a noticeable degree either, since, if real, the so-called "relativistic effects" would amount to a centimetre level, which is less than [http://gge.unb.ca/Research/GRL/GeodesyGroup/tutorial/precision_navigation.htm any other single error-source in modern navigation]. For instance, the most reliable utilization of GPS in global navigation, the [[WAAS]] system, requires no so-called "relativistic corrections" to achieve its metre-level accuracy.<br/>- <br/>-Hence, there is no evidence at the present that either of the Einstein's relativity theories is critical for the operation of the GPS system as used in local (precision) positioning or global navigation.<br/>+==Marxian interpretation of the historical origin of the surplus product==<br/>+<br/>+For most of human prehistory, there existed no economic surplus product of any kind at all, except very small or incidental surpluses. <br/>+<br/>+The main reasons were: <br/>+<br/>+*that techniques were lacking to store, preserve, package surpluses securely in large quantities or transport them reliably over any significant distance, <br/>+*the productivity of labour was not sufficient to create much more than could be consumed by a small tribe, <br/>+*early tribal societies were mostly not oriented to producing more than they could actually use, never mind maximising their production of output.  <br/>+<br/>+The formation of the first permanent surpluses are associated with tribal groups who are more or less settled in one territory, and stored foodstuffs. Once some reserves exist, tribes can diversify their production, and members can specialise in producing tools, weapons, containers and ornaments. <br/>+<br/>+Therefore, the formation of a surplus product makes possible an initial technical or economic [[division of labour]]. In addition, a secure surplus product makes possible [[population growth]], i.e. less starvation, infanticide or abandonment of the elderly or infirm. <br/>+<br/>+The first real "take off" in terms of surpluses, economic growth and population growth probably occurred during the [[neolithic revolution]], i.e. the invention and spread of [[agriculture]], possibly from about 10,000 years ago, at which time the world population is estimated to have been between 4 and 10 million. <br/>+<br/>+This created a [[division of labour]] between farmers and craftspeople, and more sophisticated forms of labour [[co-operation]] as well as the keeping of [[slaves]]. It makes possible an initial [[capital accumulation|accumulation]] of wealth, which in turn enables the formation of an [[elite]] or [[ruling class]].<br/>+<br/>+This group or class is permanently freed from the necessity to work for a living, and is therefore able to ''live off the labour of others''. This could be regarded as [[exploitation]] but also as a source of progress, insofar as the rulers have time to think and advance human [[knowledge]] and technique.<br/>+<br/>+The increasing economic division of labour is closely associated with the growth of [[trade]] and goes together with an increasing a [[social]] [[division of labour]]. One group in society utilises its position in society (e.g. the management of reserves, military leadership, religious authority, etc.) to gain control over the social surplus product; asserting its social power, the rest of the people is forced to leave the control over the surplus product to them. <br/>+<br/>+From that point on, the surplus product is formed within a ''class'' relationship, in which the exploitation of [[surplus labour]] combines with resistance to that exploitation. To maintain [[social order]] and enforce a basic [[morality]], a [[state]] apparatus emerges with soldiers and officials, separate from society and subsidized by the surplus product via taxes and tributes. Because the ruling elite controls the production and distribution of the surplus product, it thereby also controls the state. In turn, this gives rise to a moral or religious [[ideology]] which ''justifies'' superior and inferior positions in the [[division of labour]], and explains why some people are entitled to appropriate more resources than others.<br/>+<br/>+Archaeologist Brian M. Fagan comments: "The ''combination'' of economic productivity, control over sources and distribution of food and wealth, the development and maintenance of the stratified social system and its ideology, and the ability to maintain control by force was the vital ingredient of early states" (''World Prehistory'', 4th edition, p. 189). He dates the first state-organized societies at about 3100 B.C. in Egypt and Mesopotamia.<br/>+<br/>+==Surplus product and socio-economic inequality between people==<br/>+<br/>+The ''size'' of the surplus product, based on a certain level of productivity, has implications for how it can possibly be shared out. Quite simply, if there is not enough to go around, it cannot be shared equally. If 10 products are produced, and there are 100 people, it is fairly obvious they cannot all consume or use them; most likely, some will get the products, and others must do without. This is according to Marx and Engels the ultimate ''reason'' for socio-economic inequality, and why, for thousands of years, all attempts at an egalitarian society failed. Thus they wrote:<br/>+<br/>+{{Quotation|"All conquests of freedom hitherto... have been based on restricted [[productive forces]]. The production which these productive forces could provide was insufficient for the whole of society and made development possible ''only if some persons satisfied their needs at the expense of others'', and therefore some - the minority - obtained the monopoly of development, while others - the majority - owing to the constant struggle to satisfy their most essential needs, were for the time being (i.e. until the birth of new revolutionary productive forces) excluded from any development. Thus, society has hitherto always developed within the framework of a [[contradiction]] - in antiquity the contradiction between free men and slaves, in the Middle Ages that between nobility and serfs, in modern times that between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat." (''The Germany Ideology'', ed. C.J. Arthur, 1970, p. 116, emphasis added).}}<br/>+<br/>+But it would be erroneous to ''simply'' infer the pattern of socio-economic inequality from the size of the surplus product. That would be like saying that "people are poor, because they are poor". At each stage of the development of human society, there have always been different possibilities for a more equitable distribution of wealth. Which of those possibilities have been realised, is not just a question of technique or productivity, but also of the assertion of power, ideology and morals within the prevailing system of [[social relations]]. <br/>+<br/>+Some scarcity is truly ''physical'' scarcity; other scarcity is purely ''socially constructed'', i.e. people are excluded from wealth not by physical scarcity, but through the way the social system functions. In modern times, calculations have been done of the type that an annual levy of 5.2% on the fortunes of the world's 500 or so billionaires would be financially sufficient to guarantee essential needs for the ''whole world population''. In that case, there is no real ''physical'' scarcity with regard to the goods satisfying basic human needs anymore. It's more a question of political will and social organisation to improve the lot of the poor, or, alternatively, for the poor to organise themselves to improve their lot.<br/>+<br/>+==Surplus product in capitalist society==<br/>+<br/>+The category of surplus product is a  [[transhistorical]] economic category, meaning it applies to any society with a stable division of labour, and a significant labour productivity, ''regardless'' of how exactly that surplus product is produced, what it consists of, and how it is distributed. That depends on the [[social relations]] and [[relations of production]] specific to a society, within the framework of which [[surplus labour]] is performed. Thus, the exact forms taken by the surplus product are specific to the type of society which creates it.<br/>+<br/>+If we plotted economic growth or population growth rates on a graph from, let's say, the year zero, we would obtain a tangent curve, with the sharp bend occurring in the 19th century. Within the space of 100 years, a gigantic increase in productivity occurred with new forms of technology and labor-cooperation. This was, according to Marx, the "revolutionary" aspect of the [[capitalist mode of production]], and it meant a large increase in the surplus product created by human labour. Marx believed it could be the material basis for a transition to [[communism]] in the future. <br/>+<br/>+A [[socialist]] society also has a surplus product from an economic point of view, but its creation and distribution would begin to operate with different rules. In particular, how the new wealth is allocated would be decided much more according to popular-democratic and egalitarian principles, using a variety of property forms and allocative methods that have proved practically to correspond best to meeting the human needs of all. Experience with economic management shows that there is a broad scala of possibilities here; if some options are chosen, and others not, this has more to do with who holds political power than anything else.<br/>+<br/>+Specific to the surplus product within capitalist society are these main aspects (among others):<br/>+<br/>+(1) The surplus product itself no longer consists simply of "physical" surpluses or tangible [[use-value]]s, but increasingly of tradeable [[commodities]] or assets convertible into [[money]]. Claims to the social product are realised primarily through purchase with money, and the social product itself can be valued in money prices.<br/>+<br/>+(2) The economising and division of the necessary and surplus product between different uses, and between different social classes, is increasingly also expressed in quantities of [[money]] units. The emphasis is on maximising wealth as such, based on calculations in terms of abstract price relations.<br/>+<br/>+(3) There is an increasingly strong connection between the surplus product and [[surplus value]], so that, as the [[capitalist mode of production]] expands and displaces other ways of producing, surplus-value and the surplus-product become to a large extent identical. In a purely capitalist society they would be completely identical (but such a society is unlikely ever to exist, other than in economic models and analogies).<br/>+<br/>+(4) The ability to claim the surplus value created in production through the production of new output, in the form of profit income, becomes very dependent on market sales and buying power. If goods and services fail to sell, because people have no money, the business owner is left with surpluses which are useless to him, and which very likely deteriorate in value. The creates a constant need to maintain and expand market demand.<br/>+<br/>+(5) Competition between many different private enterprises exerts a strong compulsion to [[capital accumulation|accumulate]] (invest) a large part of the surplus product to maintain and improve market position, rather than consume it. For Marx, this was the main cause behind the gigantic increase in economic growth during the 19th century. <br/>+<br/>+(6) The corollary of the enormous increase in productivity is that a larger and larger component of the social product, valued in money prices, consists of the [[production]] and [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] of [[services]]. This leads to a redefinition of wealth: not just a stock of assets, but the ability to consume services enhancing the quality of life.<br/>+<br/>+(7) The dialectic of scarcity and surplus gradually begins to invert itself: the problem of optimal allocation of scarce resources begins to give away to the problem of the optimal allocation of ''abundant'' resources. High productivity leads to excess capacity: more resources can be produced than can be consumed, mainly because buying power is lacking among the masses. This can lead to [[dumping]] practices.<br/>+<br/>+Marx believed that, by splitting purely economic-commercial considerations off from legal-moral, political or religious considerations, capitalist society for the first time in history made it possible to express the ''economic'' functions applying to all types of society in their purest forms. <br/>+<br/>+In pre-capitalist society, "the economy" did not exist as a separate [[abstraction]] or [[reality]], anymore than long-term mass [[unemployment]] existed (other than in exceptional cases, such as wars or natural disasters). It is only when the "cash nexus" mediates most resource allocation, that "the economy" becomes viewed as a separate domain, quantifiable by means of money-prices.<br/>+<br/>+==Measurement of the surplus product==<br/>+<br/>+The magnitude of the surplus product can be estimated in stocks of physical [[use-value]]s, in money prices, or in labour hours. <br/>+<br/>+If it is known: <br/>+<br/>+*what and how much was produced in a year, <br/>+*what the population structure is, <br/>+*what incomes or earnings were received, <br/>+*how many hours were worked in different occupations, <br/>+*what the normal actual consumption pattern is, <br/>+<br/>+then measures of the necessary product and surplus product can in principle be estimated.<br/>+<br/>+However it is never possible to obtain mathematically exact or fully objective distinctions between necessary and surplus product, because social needs and investment requirements are always subject to moral debate and political contests between social classes. At best, some statistical ''indicators'' can be developed. Marx himself was less concerned with measurement issues than with the [[social relations]] involved in the production and distribution of the surplus product.<br/>+<br/>+Essentially the techniques for estimating the size of the surplus product in a capitalist economy are similar to those for measuring [[surplus-value]]. However, some components of the surplus product may not be marketed products or services. The existence of markets always presupposes a lot of non-markter labour as well. A physical surplus product is not the same as surplus ''value'', and the magnitudes of surplus product, surplus labour and surplus value may diverge.<br/>+<br/>+==Surplus product and the social valuation of labor==<br/>+<br/>+Although it is nowadays possible to measure the number of hours worked in a country with reasonable accuracy, there have been few attempts by social statisticians to estimate the surplus product in terms of labour hours. <br/>+<br/>+Very interesting information has become available from [[time use survey]]s however on how people in society on average spend their time. From this data, it is evident just how much modern market economies in reality depend on the performance of ''unpaid'' labour. That is, the forms of labour that are the subject of commercial exploitation are quantitatively only a sub-set of the ''total'' labour which is done in a society, and depend on non-market labour being performed.<br/>+<br/>+This in turn creates a specific and characteristic way in which different labour activities are ''valued'' and prioritised. Some forms of labour can command a high price, others have no price at all, or are priceless. Nevertheless all labor in capitalist society is influenced by value relations, irrespective of whether a price happens to be imputed to it or not. The ''commercial'' valuation of labor may not necessarily say anything though about the ''social'' or ''human'' valuation of labor.<br/>+<br/>+==Surplus product and decadence==<br/>+<br/>+Marxian theory suggests decadence involves a clear waste of a large part of the surplus product from any balanced or nuanced human point of view, and it typically goes together with growing indifference to the wellbeing and fate of other human beings; to survive, people are forced to shut out from their consciousness those horrors which are seemingly beyond their ability to do anything about, anymore.<br/>+Marx suggests that in this case the [[productive forces]] are transformed into destructive forces.<br/>+<br/>+According to Marxian theory, decaying or [[decadent]] societies are defined mainly by the fact that: <br/>+<br/>+*the gap between what is produced, and what could potentially (or technically) be produced grows sharply, or, production declines absolutely.<br/>+*a very large proportion of the surplus product is squandered, or devoted to luxury consumption, speculative activity or military expenditures.<br/>+*all sorts of activities and products appear which are really useless or even harmful from the point of view of improving human life; to the detriment of activities which are more healthy for human life as a whole.<br/>+*enormous wealth and gruesome poverty and squalor exist side by side, suggesting that society has lost its sense of moral and economic priorities.<br/>+*a consensual morality and sense of trust has broken down, and the ruling elite has lost its legitimacy in the eyes of the people, so that it can maintain power only by the crudest of methods (violence, propaganda and intimidation whereby people are cowed into submission). <br/>+*a regression occurs to the ideas, values and practices of an earlier period of human history, which may involve the treatment of other people as less than human.<br/>+*the society "fouls its own nest" in the sense of undermining the very conditions of its own [[reproduction (economics)|reproduction]].<br/>+<br/>+Marxian scholars argue this condition typically involves a stalemate in the balance of power between [[social classes]], none of which is really able to assert its dominance, and thus able to implement a constructive programme of action that would ensure real social progress, and benefit the whole population. <br/>+<br/>+However, there is a lot of controversy among historians and politicians about the existence and nature of decadence, because ''value judgements'' and [[biases]] about the meaning of human [[progress]] are usually involved. <br/>+<br/>+In different periods of history, people have defined decadence in very different ways. For example, [[hedonism]] is not necessarily decadent, it is decadent only within a certain context. Thus, accusations of decadence may be made which only reflect a certain ''moral feeling'' of social classes, not a true [[objective]] reality.<br/>+<br/>+==Criticism==<br/>+<br/>+At the simplest level, it is argued that in trade, one man's gain in another man's loss, so if we subtracted total losses from total gains, the result would be zero. So how then can there be any surplus, other than goods which fail to be traded? Many arguments have been given to show that there are only incidental surpluses of some kind. Yet, peculiarly, even on a crude estimate of [[value added]], the [[Gross Output]] value of production equals more than labour and materials costs. The denial that a surplus product exists therefore tends to focus more on the definition of it, i.e. "surplus" in relation to what exactly? Some ecologists also argue that we should produce no more than we really need, in an ecologically responsible way.<br/> <br/> ==References==<br/>-* J.C. Hafele and R.

The court's appellate jurisdiction encompasses "all cases" within the scope of Article III, but is subject to limitation by [[act of Congress|acts of Congress]]{{fact}} and by the discretion of the Court.<br/>-<br/>-The Supreme Court meets in [[Washington, D.C.]], in the [[United States Supreme Court building]]. The Court is sometimes referred to by the abbreviations '''SCOTUS''' (Supreme Court of the United States) and '''USSC''' (United States Supreme Court). The Court's yearly terms start on the first Monday in October and finish sometime during the following June or July. Each term consists of alternating two week intervals. During the first interval, the court is in session ('sitting') and hears cases, and during the second interval, the court is recessed to consider and write opinions on cases they have heard.<br/>-<br/>-==History==<br/>-{{main|History of the Supreme Court of the United States}}<br/>-<br/>-The History of the Supreme Court is generally told in terms of the Chief Justices who have presided over it.<br/>-<br/>-Initially, during the tenures of Chief Justices [[John Jay|Jay]], [[John Rutledge|Rutledge]], and [[Oliver Ellsworth|Ellsworth]] (1789–1801), the Court lacked a home of its own and any real prestige. <br/>-<br/>-That changed forever during the [[John Marshall|Marshall]] Court (1801–1835), which declared the Court to be the supreme arbiter of the Constitution (see ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]''), and made a number of important rulings which gave shape and substance to the Constitutional balance of power between the Federal government (referred to at the time as the "general" government) and the states.  But ''[[Martin v. Hunter's Lessee]]'' showed the limits of that federal power&mdash;although the U.S. High Court declared itself supreme over the Virginia state court, it had a difficult time enforcing its judgment in a hostile state. The Marshall Court ended the practice of each judge issuing his opinion ''[[seriatim]]'', a remnant of British tradition, and instead one majority opinion of the Court was issued. The Marshall Court also saw Congress impeach a sitting Justice, [[Samuel Chase]], who was acquitted. This impeachment was one piece of the power struggle between the Jeffersonians and the [[Federalists]] after the election of 1800 and the subsequent change in power. The failure to remove Chase is thought to signal the recognition by Congress of [[judicial independence]].<br/>-<br/>-The [[Roger B. Taney|Taney]] Court (1836–1864) made a number of important rulings, such as ''[[Sheldon v. Sill]]'', which held that while Congress may not limit the subjects the Supreme Court may hear, the Constitution does not so restrain it where lower courts are concerned.  However, it is primarily remembered for its ruling in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'', the case which may have helped precipitate the [[United States Civil War]]. In the years following the Civil War, the [[Salmon P. Chase|Chase]], [[Morrison Waite|Waite]], and [[Melville Fuller|Fuller]] courts (1864–1910) interpreted the new civil war amendments to the Constitution, and developed the doctrine of [[substantive due process]] (''[[Lochner v. New York]]''; ''[[Adair v. United States]]'').  Under the [[Edward Douglass White|White]] and [[William Howard Taft|Taft]] courts (1910–1930), the substantive due process doctrine reached its first apogee (''[[Adkins v. Children's Hospital]]''), and the Court held that the 14th Amendment applied some provisions of the [[Bill of Rights]] to the states (''[[Gitlow v. New York]]''). <br/>-<br/>-During the [[Charles Evans Hughes|Hughes]], [[Harlan Fiske Stone|Stone]], and [[Fred M. Vinson|Vinson]] courts (1930–1953), the court gained its own accommodation (see [[United States Supreme Court building]]) and radically changed its interpretation of the Constitution in order to facilitate the [[New Deal]] (''[[West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish]]''), giving an expansive reading to the powers of the Federal Government. The [[Earl Warren|Warren]] Court (1953–1969) made a number of alternately celebrated and controversial rulings expanding the application of the Constitution to civil liberties, leading a renaissance in [[substantive due process]].  It held that [[segregation]] was unconstitutional (''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]''), that the Constitution protects a general right to privacy (''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]''), that schools cannot have official prayer (''[[Engel v. Vitale]]'') or, ''[[a fortiori]]'', ''mandatory'' Bible readings (''[[Abington School District v. Schempp]]''), dramatically increased the scope of the doctrine of incorporation (''[[Mapp v. Ohio]]''; ''[[Miranda v. Arizona]]''), read an [[equal protection]] clause into the [[Fifth Amendment]] (''[[Bolling v. Sharpe]]''), held that the states may not apportion a chamber of their legislatures in the manner in which the United States Senate is apportioned (''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]''), and held that the Constitution requires active compliance (''[[Gideon v. Wainwright]]''). <br/>-<br/>-The [[Warren E. Burger|Burger]] Court (1969–1986) ruled that abortion was a constitutional right (''[[Roe v. Wade]]''), reached muddled and controversial rulings on [[affirmative action]] (''[[Regents of the University of California v. Bakke]]'') and campaign finance regulation (''[[Buckley v. Valeo]]''), and that the [[death penalty]] was unconstitutional (''[[Furman v. Georgia]]'') and then later that it was ''not'' unconstitutional (''[[Gregg v. Georgia]]''). <br/>-<br/>-The [[William Rehnquist|Rehnquist]] Court (1986–2005) narrowed the focus of the private right of action, the right of labor unions to picket (''[[Lechmere Inc. v. NLRB]]'') and of ''Roe v. Wade'' (''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'') but dramatically circumscribed the ability of states to regulate abortion (''[[Stenberg v. Carhart]]''), gave sweeping meaning to [[ERISA]] pre-emption (''[[Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc.]]'', ''[[Egelhoff v. Egelhoff]]'') thereby denying plaintiffs access to state court with the consequence of limiting compensation for tort like harm to medical patients covered by employer plans to very circumscribed remedies (''[[Aetna Health Inc. v. Davila]]'', ''[[CIGNA Healthcare of Texas Inc. v. Calad]]'') and began an instauration of [[federalism]], limiting the scope of Congressional power under the Commerce Clause (''[[United States v. Lopez]]''; ''[[United States v. Morrison]]'').<br/>-<br/>-The [[John Roberts|Roberts]] Court (2005-Present) began with the confirmation and swearing in of [[John Roberts]] on [[September 29]], [[2005]], and is the current court.<br/>-<br/>-==Composition==<br/>-===Size of the court===<br/>-[[Image:SCOTUS 2006(2).jpg|thumb|350px|The Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States as of 2006.  Top row (left to right): [[Stephen G. Breyer]], [[Clarence Thomas]], [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], and [[Samuel A. Alito]].  Bottom row (left to right): [[Anthony M. Kennedy]], [[John Paul Stevens]], [[John G. Roberts]], [[Antonin Scalia|Antonin G. Scalia]], and [[David Souter|David H. Souter]].]]<br/>-<br/>-The United States Constitution does not specify the size of the Supreme Court; instead, Congress has the power to fix the number of Justices. Originally, the total number of Justices was set at six by the [[Judiciary Act of 1789]].  As the country grew geographically, the number of Justices steadily increased. The court was expanded to seven members in 1807, nine in 1837 and ten in 1863. In 1866, however, Congress wished to deny President [[Andrew Johnson]] any Supreme Court appointments, and therefore passed the [[Judicial Circuits Act]], which provided that the next three Justices to retire would not be replaced; thus, the size of the Court would eventually reach seven by attrition. Consequently, one seat was removed in 1866 and a second in 1867. By the [[Circuit Judges Act]] of 1869, the number of Justices was again set at nine (the Chief Justice and eight Associate Justices), where it has remained ever since. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] attempted to expand the Court (see [[Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937]]);  his plan would have allowed the President to appoint one new, additional justice for every justice who reached the age of seventy but did not retire from the bench, until the Court reached a maximum size of fifteen justices. Ostensibly, this was to ease the burdens of the docket on the elderly judges, but it was widely believed that the President's actual purpose was to add Justices who would favor his [[New Deal]] policies, which had been regularly ruled unconstitutional by the Court.  The plan failed in Congress and the court changed course (see [[the switch in time that saved nine]]).  In any case, Roosevelt's long tenure in the White House allowed him to appoint a large number of Justices.<br/>-<br/>-===Nomination, confirmation and tenure of Justices===<br/>-Per Article II of the [[United States Constitution]], the power to appoint Justices belongs to the [[President of the United States]], acting with the advice and consent of the Senate. As a general rule, Presidents nominate individuals who broadly share their ideological views. However, nominees whose views are perceived as extreme may be blocked by the Senate (''see'' [[List of Failed Nominations to the Supreme Court of the United States]]). In many cases, a Justice's decisions may be contrary to what the nominating President anticipated. A famous instance was Chief Justice [[Earl Warren]]; President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] expected him to be a conservative judge, but his decisions are arguably among the most liberal in the Court's history. Eisenhower later called the appointment "the biggest damn fool mistake I ever made"<ref name="purdum">{{cite news<br/>-  | first=Purdum<br/>-  | last=Todd S.<br/>-  | title=Presidents, Picking Justices, Can Have Backfires<br/>-  | work=Courts in Transition: Nominees and History<br/>-  | publisher=[[New York Times]]<br/>-  | page=A4<br/>-  | date=[[July 5]], [[2005]]<br/>-  | accessdate=2006-04-24<br/>-}}</ref>.<br/>-<br/>-While the President may ''nominate'' anyone (there are no qualifications listed in the Constitution regarding prior legal or judicial experience, nor are there any exclusions of foreign-born nominees), the "[[advice and consent]]" of the Senate is required for ''appointment''. The confirmation process often attracts considerable attention from special interest groups, many of whom lobby senators to confirm or to reject. The [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] conducts hearings, questioning nominees to determine their suitability. Thereafter, the whole Senate considers the nomination; a simple majority vote is required to confirm or to reject a nominee. Rejections are relatively uncommon; the Senate has [[List of Failed Nominations to the Supreme Court of the United States|explicitly rejected]] only twelve Supreme Court nominees in its history. The most recent rejection of a nominee came in 1987, when the Senate refused to confirm [[Robert Bork]]. In 1991, [[Clarence Thomas]]'s nomination was hampered by allegations of sexual harassment, but the Senate eventually confirmed him by a vote of 52-48.<br/>-<br/>-Not everyone nominated by the President has received a floor vote in the Senate. For example, a nominee may be filibustered. A [[filibuster]] indefinitely prolongs debate thereby preventing a final vote on the nominee. It is also possible for the President to withdraw a nominee's name at any time before the actual confirmation vote occurs. This usually happens when the President feels that the nominee has little chance of being confirmed. Most recently, President [[George W. Bush]] granted a request by [[Harriet Miers]] to withdraw her 2005 nomination before even a committee hearing had been scheduled, citing her concerns about Senate requests for access to internal White House documents during the confirmation process. Prior to that, President [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1987 withdrew the name of [[Douglas H. Ginsburg]] soon after the announcement of his nomination because allegations of marijuana use had arisen concerning him.<br/>-<br/>-While the filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee may be an option to bar their confirmation, no nominee for Associate Justice has ever been filibustered. As a sitting Associate Justice of the Court, [[Abe Fortas]]'s nomination to become Chief Justice was successfully filibustered in 1968. President Johnson had nominated him to be Chief Justice of the United States after [[Earl Warren]] retired.<br/>-<br/>-Until the 1980s, the approval process of Justices was frequently quick. From the Truman through Nixon administrations, Justices were typically approved in a month. From the Reagan administration through the current administration of George W. Bush, however, the process took much longer. Some speculate this is because of the increasing political role Justices play.[http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/forum/symposium-jc/balkin.php]<br/>-<br/>-When the Senate is in recess, the President may make a temporary appointment without the Senate's advice and consent. Such a recess appointee to the Supreme Court holds office only until the end of the next Senate session (at most, approximately two years). To continue to serve thereafter, the nominee must be confirmed by the Senate.  Of the two Chief Justices and six Associate Justices who have received recess appointments, only Chief Justice [[John Rutledge]] was not subsequently confirmed for a full term.<br/>-<br/>-The Constitution provides that Justices "shall hold their Offices during good Behavior" (unless appointed during a Senate recess). The term "good behavior" is interpreted to mean life. However, Justices may resign, retire into [[senior status]], or be removed by impeachment and conviction by congressional vote (the last has never occurred). On average, a vacancy arises every two years; however, long stretches without any vacancies occur from time to time. For instance, no vacancy arose for the eleven years between [[Stephen Breyer]]'s appointment in 1994 and Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]]'s death in 2005.<br/>-<br/>-The Supreme Court's [[jurisprudence]] is often evaluated with respect to the service of a particular Chief Justice. Thus, for example, the Court between 1969 and 1986 is referred to as the "Burger Court" (for Chief Justice [[Warren E. Burger]]) and the Court between 1986 and 2005 is referred to as the "Rehnquist Court" (for Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]]).<br/>-<br/>-===Other functions===<br/>-Under the [[Judiciary Act of 1789]], each Justice was required to "ride circuit," or to travel within the assigned circuit and consider cases alongside local judges. This practice, however, encountered opposition from many Justices, who complained about the difficulty of travel. Moreover, several individuals opposed it on the grounds that a Justice could not be expected to be impartial in an appeal if he had previously decided the same case while riding circuit. Circuit riding was abolished in 1891. Now, the duty of a Supreme Court Justice in this regard is generally limited to hearing emergency petitions in the relevant circuit and some other routine tasks like addressing certain requests for extensions of time. The Justice assigned to a given circuit is known within that circuit as "the Circuit Justice" and may, but in practice almost never does, sit as a judge of that circuit. A Circuit Justice takes precedence over the Chief Judge of the circuit when a Justice decides to sit.<br/>-<br/>-The Chief Justice is usually assigned to the District of Columbia Circuit, the Federal Circuit and the Fourth Circuit (which surrounds the District of Columbia); each Associate Justice is assigned to one or two judicial circuits.<br/>-<br/>-After Associate Justice Alito's appointment, circuits were assigned as follows[http://www.supremecourtus.gov/orders/courtorders/020106pzr.pdf]:<br/>-*For the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|D.C.

Four of the current Justices are assigned to circuits on which they once sat as circuit judges: Chief Justice Roberts (D.C.

The four-story building was designed in a classical style sympathetic to the surrounding buildings of the [[United States Capitol|Capitol complex]] and [[Library of Congress]] by architect [[Cass Gilbert]], and is clad in marble quarried chiefly in Vermont. The building includes space for the Courtroom, Justices' chambers, an extensive law library, various meeting spaces, and auxiliary services such as workshop, stores, cafeteria and a gymnasium. The Supreme Court building is within the ambit of the [[Architect of the Capitol]], but maintains its own police force, separate from the Capitol Police.<br/>-<br/>-==Jurisdiction==<br/>-{{main|Procedures of the Supreme Court of the United States}}<br/>-<br/>-[[Article Three of the United States Constitution]] outlines the jurisdiction of the federal courts of the United States:<br/>-<br/>-<blockquote>''The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority; to all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls; to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction; to Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party; to Controversies between two or more States; between a State and Citizens of another State; between Citizens of different States; between Citizens of the same State claiming Lands under Grants of different States, and between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects.</blockquote><br/>-<br/>-The jurisdiction of the federal courts was further limited by the [[Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eleventh Amendment]], which forbade the federal courts from hearing cases "commenced or prosecuted against [a State] by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State." However, the Eleventh Amendment is not deemed to apply if a state consents to be sued (see [[Sovereign immunity#In the United States|Sovereign immunity]]). Moreover, the Supreme Court has ruled that Congress may abrogate the states' immunity from lawsuits in certain circumstances. In addition to constitutional constraints, the jurisdiction of the federal courts is also limited by various federal laws. For example, the federal courts may consider "Controversies ... between Citizens of different States" only if the [[amount in controversy]] exceeds $75,000; otherwise, the case may only be brought in state courts. {{further|[[diversity jurisdiction]]}}<br/>-<br/>-The Constitution specifies that the Supreme Court may exercise original jurisdiction in cases affecting ambassadors and other diplomats, and in cases in which a state is a party. In all other cases, however, the Supreme Court has only appellate jurisdiction. The Supreme Court considers cases based on its original jurisdiction very rarely; almost all cases are brought to the Supreme Court on appeal.  In practice, the only original jurisdiction cases heard by the Court are disputes between two or more states.<br/>-<br/>-The power of the Supreme Court to consider appeals from state courts, rather than just federal courts, was created by the [[Judiciary Act of 1789]] and upheld early in the Court's history, by its rulings in ''[[Martin v. Hunter's Lessee]]'' (1816) and ''[[Cohens v. Virginia]]'' (1821).  The Supreme Court is the only federal court that has jurisdiction over direct appeals from state court decisions, although there are a variety of devices that permit so-called "collateral review" of state cases.<br/>-<br/>-The Supreme Court may only hear actual cases and controversies. It does not hear [[mootness|moot]] cases or issue advisory opinions. However, the Court may consider some cases, such as ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', that become moot during the judicial process, if it appears that the legal issue involved is likely to arise again but would not be reviewable by the Court under a strict mootness analysis. [[Norma McCorvey|"Roe"]] had already had her baby when the case came to the Supreme Court, because judicial activity (trials, appeals and so on) takes much longer than human gestation. Because future abortion cases would face the same time constraints, the Court decided the case in spite of its mootness.<br/>-<br/>-The Supreme Court is not required to hear every case presented to it. In cases that are heard by a three-judge [[United States district court]] (a practice that formerly was somewhat common but has been limited to very few cases by legislation in recent years), there is a right of appeal directly to the Supreme Court, although the Court may dispose of these appeals by summary order if it does not believe they are important enough for full briefing and argument.  In most instances, however, the party must petition the Supreme Court for a [[certiorari|writ of ''certiorari'']]. By [[rule of four|custom]], ''certiorari'' is granted on the vote of four of the nine Justices.  In most cases, the writ is denied; the Supreme Court normally only considers matters of national or constitutional importance. If the Court refuses to grant ''certiorari'', it does not comment on the merits of the case; the decision of the lower court stands unchanged as if Supreme Court review had not been requested.<br/>-<br/>-==Court reports and citation style==<br/>-<br/>-Supreme Court decisions are typically cited as in the following example: "''[[Roe v. Wade]],'' 410 U.S. 113 (1973)." The citation consists of the names of the opposing parties; the volume number; "U.S." (signifying [[United States Reports]], the official reporter of Supreme Court decisions); the page number on which the decision begins; and the year in which the case was decided. The names of the opposing parties are listed in the format "''Petitioner v. Respondent''" or "''Appellant v. Appellee''." The [[Supreme Court of the United States Reporter of Decisions|Reporter of Decisions]] is responsible for publication of the Court's rulings. There are two other widely-used reporters: the Supreme Court Reporter and the Lawyer's Edition, corresponding to two privately-published collections of decisions.  For more information on how these reports are cited<noinclude></noinclude>, see [[Case_citation#United_States_Supreme_Court|case citation]].''<br/>-<br/>-==Checks and balances==<br/>-The Constitution does not explicitly grant the Supreme Court the power of judicial review; nevertheless, the power of the Supreme Court to overturn laws and executive actions it deems unlawful or unconstitutional is a well-established precedent. Many of the Founding Fathers accepted the notion of judicial review; in [[Federalist No. 78]], [[Alexander Hamilton]] writes: "A constitution is, in fact, and must be regarded by the judges, as a fundamental law. It therefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning, as well as the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body. If there should happen to be an irreconcilable variance between the two, that which has the superior obligation and validity ought, of course, to be preferred; or, in other words, the Constitution ought to be preferred to the statute." The Supreme Court first established its power to declare laws unconstitutional in ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'' (1803), consummating the system of [[checks and balances]]. <br/>-<br/>-The Supreme Court cannot directly enforce its rulings; instead, it relies on respect for the Constitution and for the law for adherence to its judgments. One notable instance of [[nonacquiescence]] came in 1832, when the state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] ignored the Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Worcester v. Georgia]]''. President [[Andrew Jackson]], who sided with the Georgia courts, is supposed to have remarked, "[[John Marshall]] has made his decision; now let him enforce it!"; however, this quotation is likely apocryphal. State militia in the South also resisted the desegregation of public schools after the 1954 judgment ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]''.  More recently, many feared that President [[Richard Nixon]] would refuse to comply with the Court's order in ''[[United States v. Nixon]]'' (1974) to surrender the [[Watergate scandal|Watergate tapes]].  Nixon, however, ultimately complied with the Supreme Court's ruling.<br/>-<br/>-The Constitution provides that the salary of a Justice may not be diminished during his or her continuance in office. This clause was intended to prevent Congress from punishing Justices for their decisions by reducing their emoluments. Together with the provision that Justices hold office for life, this clause helps guarantee [[judicial independence]]. However, as seen above, the President's practice of appointing justices with similar real, perceived or expected ideology can be seen to compromise judicial independence.<br/>-<br/>-==See also==<br/>-*[[History of the Supreme Court of the United States]]<br/>-*[[List of United States Supreme Court cases|Lists of Supreme Court cases]]:<br/>-**[[List of United States Supreme Court cases from the Jay Court through the Taft Court|From the Jay Court through the Taft Court]]<br/>-**[[List of United States Supreme Court cases from the Hughes Court through the Burger Court|From the Hughes Court through the Burger Court]] <br/>-**[[List of United States Supreme Court cases from the Rehnquist Court through the Roberts Court|From the Rehnquist Court through the Roberts Court]] <br/>-*Justices<br/>-**[[List of Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States|List of Supreme Court Justices]]&#0151;[[List of Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States by court composition|by court composition]], [[List of Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States by seat|by seat]], [[List of Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States by time in office|by time in office]]<br/>-**[[Demographics of the Supreme Court of the United States]]<br/>-**[[Federal judicial appointment history#Supreme Court|Supreme Court appointment history]]<br/>-**[[Unsuccessful nominations to the Supreme Court of the United States]]<br/>-*[[List of law clerks of the Supreme Court of the United States]]<br/>-*[[Federal government of the United States]]<br/>-**[[United States federal courts]]<br/>-***[[United States district court]]<br/>-***[[United States federal judicial circuit]]<br/>-*[[United States Supreme Court building]]<br/>-*[[case citation]]<br/>-*[[Judicial interpretation]]<br/>-*[[Judiciary]]<br/>-*[[Legal research]]<br/>-<br/>-==References==<br/>-<references /><br/>-<br/>-*[[American Bar Association]].

I mean, "fancruft?" "Icky, sticky, things?" If you're going to protest because it isn't encyclopedic enough, then be professional yourself and cite examples of what's wrong and give suggestions on how to fix things '''first'''. As a matter of fact, I've been waiting for the new HISTORY OF THE DC UNIVERSE (to be included in issues 2 to 11 of [[52 (comics)|52]]) to come out (this month and the next) so we can properly update the list and provide an official source. [[User:Wilfredo Martinez|Wilfredo Martinez]] 16:08, 10 May 2006 (UTC)<br/>+::Why don't you tell me why it IS encyclopedic first, or at least within the bounds of Wikipedia? Even after ''History of the DCU'', any events ''after'' that point are necessarily colored by whatever people who contribute afterwards decide. That is, until the ''next'' timeline comes out, at which point anything after ''that'' is colored by what people here decide, and so on, ad infinitum. Wikipedia is not a publisher of original thought. Granted, the timeline only focuses on extremely major events, those that have been established in official histories and placed down according to those, but let's face it. We're talking about the chronology of a fictional universe, and unlike other articles on aspects of fictional universes, this one has ZERO bearing on any actual stories. How often will "Bruce Wayne's parents were killed 25 years ago" have any real impact on anything, except as a trivia question, seriously? THAT'S what I mean by fancruft. By the same token, unlike in most topics having an "official" timeline actually means very little, especially if someone like [http://dcu.smartmemes.com] comes along and (very publicly) declares the "official" version "wrong". (Maybe it's my admiration of that site that's coloring my decision to question this page's existence.) I'm also bringing up similar points at [[Talk:Timeline of the Marvel Universe]], which has even less reason to exist.

Besides this it is also the headquarters of the [[South East Central Railway]] which comprises of Bilaspur, Nagpur and Raipur division.<br/>+::This article exists because the continuity of the DC Universe is of interest to a LOT of people: casual readers, hardcore fans, and even comics professionals. DC has published official timelines every time there's been a revision to their continuity. More importantly, it exists because many people have both worked on and read the article, which is what WIKIPEDIA is all about. That YOU think a timeline for a fictional universe is ultimately pointless is not enough reason to ask for deletion, especially considering the numerous fictional timelines already included on Wikipedia.  And by the way, it is also against the spirit of Wikipedia to just delete stuff instead of asking for improvement first. One person's "fancruft" can be another person's hard-worked-for goal. Next time, point out EXACTLY what is wrong with any article and ask for corrections (or do them yourself) first. Also, never lose sight that, ultimately, Wikipedia is a WIKI, not a real encyclopedia; nothing, not even deletion, is permanent here- it will be what the public makes out of it. Getting too obsessed with the rules can lead to endless arguments and revision wars. [[User:Wilfredo Martinez|Wilfredo Martinez]] 01:45, 11 May 2006 (UTC)<br/>+:::Please keep things [[WP:CIVIL]]. I personally remain unconvinced this is exactly the province of Wikipedia. And I think a reading of [[WP:NOT]] may be in order as well. But I will drop this debate for now and let this stand as food for thought. I have nothing against the ''continuity'' of the DCU, but having a formal ''timeline'' may be pushing it.

And I'm aware of what wikipedia is; as I explained, it's a Wiki, and while trying to keep it as correct and useful as possible is entertaining, it will never be a true encyclopedia as long as it keeps allowing any casual user to alter anything at any time. There is no point in arguing over that so I won't. And you may wish to discuss the actual usefulness of Fictional Timelines in general in the approriate areas, such as [[Timeline of Fictional Events]].

But these happened to include those who could have ended the war quickly (like The Spectre). It must be noted that in a recent issue of Action Comics (featuring memories of the Earth-2 Superman) the barrier was shown as being an impenetrable wall rather than a mind-control zone, but this is a definite reinterpretation of the spell (likely an error on the writer's part.) Hopefully the new History of the DC Universe segment of 52 will clear up this up soon. [[User:Wilfredo Martinez|Wilfredo Martinez]] 14:18, 21 May 2006 (UTC)<br/>+::THe Spear of Longinus has been shown to control anyone with powers.

In addition, if anyone with superhuman abilities were affected by the spell, several of the Creature Commandos would not have been able to operate on Axis territory.

In any case, my point is that the particular USE of the Spear at the time affected only the magic-sensitive heroes, not that Spear couldn't have been used in a different way by someone else later. It might be that the Spear can control anyone but only at short range. In fact, the spell was cast with help from the Holy Grail, which suggests that the Spear couldn't have casted the spell by itself all over the Axis territories.

I understand that the '''DC Universe 2000 Secret Files''' also updated the timeline, but I've not seen it so I don't know that for a fact (anyone reading this has it?)(This may have been where Superman's origin was changed to the [[Superman: Birthright]] version). And of course various '''DC Secret Files (New Gods, Vertigo''', etc.) kept adding their own timelines... most of them not fitting together very well, from what I've heard. Right now, for better or worse, [[52 (comics)|52]]'s History of DC Universe *IS* the official timeline, though they really haven't changed anything important (other than the fact that the Multiverse DID exist but was destroyed (instead of having been prevented from ever existing) and the fact The Monitor '''''MIGHT''''' never have been killed. And no, dates aren't being offered in it. <br/>+<br/>+Personally, I think Chris J. Miller's '''Unathorized Chronology of the DC Universe''' (http://dcu.smartmemes.com/) is THE best DC Timeline around; he obviously has the dedication and research skills to write and maintain it, AND he provides detailed references for each entry. Though he does include his own theories to explain certain glaring discrepancies, he clearly points out which ones they are; I'm basing my work on our Timeline on his, but trying to limit it to only the important events (otherwise it would balloon to outside accepted WP proportions) and not mentioning it as an official source (instead using his references.) Sadly, he won't be updating it until 52 is over, though that is understandable.

I would recommend that you read [[Wikipedia:Mediation Cabal/Suggestions for mediators]] first for some guidelines, and I cannot stress enough the importance of asking for help should you feel lost or are experiencing difficulty. Also, feel free to add yourself to the list of cabalists on the main page. <font color="DarkGreen">[[User:Cowman109|Cowman109]]</font><sup>[[User talk:Cowman109|Talk]]</sup> 02:17, 5 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-:: Edit conflict :) I will also add that before I took my first case, I looked at how some other mediators handled things, but ultimately it's up to you.  Just remember to stay neutral and help them reach a consensus.  I and others are always available to help or answer questions. --<font color="3300FF">[[User:Aguerriero|Aguerriero]] ([[User_talk:Aguerriero|talk]])</font> 02:20, 5 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-== Question about how to approach a case ==<br/>-<br/>-I'm interested in mediating, and hope to choose a case soon; I'm still reading policies and cases for now so I can educate myself a little more before diving in.  That brought up one question, which I thought I'd ask here.<br/>-<br/>-In the [[Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal/Cases/2006-08-01_John_Prescott|John Prescott]] case, currently "new", the conflict was over salacious allegations about Prescott.  The case seems to have been resolved well.  However, if I'd been mediating, I'd have said some slightly different things than the mediator involved ([[User:CQJ]]).  This is not at all a criticism of CQJ; I'm trying to understand what approaches are thought to be best, and just where to draw the line between trying to help people come to an agreement, on the one hand, and letting them know when they are contravening WP policies, on the other.<br/>-<br/>-In this case the salacious allegations were that Prescott had a small penis.  One party to the mediation commented on the talk page that although that itself was not verifiable, the fact that the allegations were widely known and discussed in the UK, and that Prescott was an object of ridicule as a result, was indeed verifiable and worthy of inclusion.<br/>-<br/>-CQJ asked for sources before taking the case.  I think this was designed to remind the participants that the policies on [[WP:V|verifiability]] and [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] would apply, and short cut the discussion.  As I said above, this has apparently been successful.<br/>-<br/>-I agree that those two policies apply.  I think my reflex would have been to say that I'd take the case, and try to get agreement from the participants over the extent of the relevance of those policies to the proposed additional text.  Would that have been wrong?  CQJ's comment in the case made it clear he was amused, but willing to take it, and may have struck just the right note to defuse tension.  But I was surprised when I first saw it, because I wasn't expecting to see a mediator refuse to take a case.<br/>-<br/>-I'd be glad of any comments.  Thanks -- [[User:Mike Christie|Mike Christie]] 17:21, 9 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-:Well, we are an informal process so there are, of course, different ways about doing things. In that case in particular, with information such as that, especially on a living person per [[WP:LIVING]], [[WP:VERIFY|verifiability]] is key. If people went about insulting the size of his manhood and he stumbled upon the Wikipedia entry, I'm sure a firestorm would stir up. Your method could have worked too, I'm sure. I honestly don't think such information is relevant, but even if it was relevant, unless there is a verifiable source that says the belief is indeed true and it's been documented, verifiablility is often the most important thing in a biography of a living person (it should be on all articles, anyway). <font color="DarkGreen">[[User:Cowman109|Cowman109]]</font><sup>[[User talk:Cowman109|Talk]]</sup> 17:30, 9 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-::Wow, why didn't anyone come and get me? (laughing out loud).  Essentially, I took a look at everything, and the case was requested by...Wait for it....<br/>-<br/>-::Johnprescottssecretlovechild.<br/>-<br/>-::Case requested by a user whose sole intent was probably going to be to nail the [[John Prescott]] article with a bunch of garbage. I know that's not [[WP:AGF]], but a guy called Johnprescottssecretlovechild editing the [[John Prescott]] article, trying to say that he's got a large or nonexistent penis, well...you can see the humor in that :-). Like Cowman said, we have to be very careful with living biographical articles for our good, the Foundation's good, and the good of the person being covered, and everything must apply to [[WP:V]], [[WP:OR]], [[WP:NPA]], and [[WP:LIVING]].  I take a strict interpretation of the trifecta and most Wikipedia policy, including [[WP:IAR]], but in this case, [[WP:IAR]] would have probably gotten someone in some major trouble once Prescott's office found out, in addition, there's other users who need the help of the MedCab over someone who wants to add something about an MP's penis that can't meet verifiability or original research standards off the bat.  So I short-circuited the process and said the only way I'd work with it was to get three verifiable sources off the bat.  Bada bing, bada boom.  [[User:CQJ|CQJ]] 15:41, 11 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-== Backlog ==<br/>-<br/>-I've noticed a backlog of open cases. Is there anything we can do to close cases that are still left open, which are in fact old? Possibly ask the mediator to close it? Review the case and close it ourseleves? [[User:SynergeticMaggot|SynergeticMaggot]] 02:12, 11 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-:I recently closed about 6 innactive cases - I usually look at the old ones that don't seem to be active and leave a note in the mediator response section asking if the case is innactive. After a few days, if there is no response, I leave a note asking those involved to file a new case request if they are still having issues and I change the category to closed. Feel free to help clearing out the old ones that no longer seem to be in need of assistance. In many cases disputes just die down with time, which helps :). <font color="DarkGreen">[[User:Cowman109|Cowman109]]</font><sup>[[User talk:Cowman109|Talk]]</sup> 02:45, 11 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-::Will do.

I recently just had a close (for another mediator) I did blow up on my RfA. :) Everything was worked out but I gave it some thought and decided that I should at least address the issue here first.

There has been substantial mediation in the past, which went on hiatus because the mediator left the case.  One participant has indicated that they do not wish to go through mediation; see [[Talk:Committee_for_the_Scientific_Investigation_of_Claims_of_the_Paranormal#Mediation|the talk page]].  I'm inclined to let them know I'll wait a week to see if there is a change of mind.  However, after that, what happens to the case?  The participant who requested mediation is still willing to participate.  Should I proceed with that participant alone, and attempt to make appropriate edits?  Any advice would be appreciated.  Thanks in advance -- [[User:Mike Christie|Mike Christie]] 13:51, 12 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-:FYI, we appear to have gotten past the obstacle, so I think I'm OK now.  Thanks.  [[User:Mike Christie|Mike Christie]] 23:09, 12 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-== The new case templates! ==<br/>-<br/>-As some of you may have noticed, we have now implemented a template for cases that specifically allows the bot to do three things - it lists the category, lists the name of the mediator on the case page, and lists the status of the case as how you would like to say it. Here is how it works:<br/>-<br/>-At the top of the page you'll see this:<br/>-<pre><br/>-<nowiki><br/>-{{Medcabstatus<br/>-|status = open<br/>-|article = <br/>-|requestor = <br/>-|parties = <br/>-|mediators = <br/>-|comment = <br/>-}}<br/>-</nowiki><br/>-</pre><br/>-<br/>-'''Status''' There are three options for status: '''new''', '''open''', and '''closed'''. These affect the listing of the case - new is in new cases of course, open goes into the open cases section, and closed simply delists the case (we're still not archiving cases yet, so they're hiding in the closed cases category).<br/>-<br/>-'''Article''' Here you can list the name of the article, the source of the dispute. At the moment you just write the name of the article ''with'' <nowiki> [[ and ]] </nowiki> around it, so you can list multiple links if needed. This does not affect anything, but just lists the name of the article at the top of the case page.<br/>-<br/>-'''Requestor''', here you can put the name of the requester - once again, it's just to make the top of the page look nice and organized.<br/>-<br/>-'''Parties''', here you list the parties, same as above.<br/>-<br/>-'''Mediators''', the mediators listing shows up on the case list. Preferably you could use the format <nowiki>{{user|username}}</nowiki>, but anything works.<br/>-<br/>-'''Comment''', this also shows up on the case list. If you feel it is necessary, please put a short comment here about the status of the case, such as needs new mediator, or waiting for parties to respond. This is entirely optional, however, though in some cases it is good to signal to other mediators that there may be some help needed.<br/>-<br/>-And that's about it! Any questions? This should be implemented shortly into the case list, and the format of it is still changeable should any issues arise. <font color="DarkGreen">[[User:Cowman109|Cowman109]]</font><sup>[[User talk:Cowman109|Talk]]</sup> 20:43, 17 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-:Thanks for putting this together; I really like the automatic mdoerator and status listings on the main page that this generates.

One enhancement occurs to me that would be handy; is it possible to have the display on the main page show the date of last update to the template or the case?  Automatically, if possible.  That way it would be possible to see cases that appear to have gone inactive, or at least where the mediation may have gone inactive. [[User:Mike Christie|Mike Christie]] [[User_talk:Mike Christie|(talk)]] 03:41, 19 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-:::::Ahah, Ericj actually brought up the possibility of getting some sort of color code system or something similar that could show case pages that were left unupdated, but I felt that when mediation occurs on the talk page of articles instead of on the case page, the information could be skewed.

Against this, [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] argued, in the preface of his [[Discourse on Inequality]] (1754), that man starts as an animal, though not one "devoid of intellect and freedom." <ref name=Rousseau>[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau, Jean-Jacques]]. ''[[Discourse on Inequality]]'', 1754, preface.</ref> However, as animals are sensitive beings, "they too ought to participate in natural right, and that man is subject to some sort of duties toward them," specifically "one [has] the right not to be uselessly mistreated by the other." <ref name=Rousseau/><br/>-<br/>-Contemporaneous with Rousseau was the Scottish writer [[John Oswald (activist)|John Oswald]], who died in 1793. In ''The Cry of Nature or an Appeal to Mercy and Justice on Behalf of the Persecuted Animals'', Oswald argued that man is naturally equipped with feelings of mercy and compassion. {{fact}} If each man had to witness the death of the animals he ate, he argued, a vegetarian diet would be far more common. The division of labor, however, allows modern man to eat flesh without experiencing what Oswald called the prompting of man's natural sensitivities, while the brutalization of modern man made him inured to these sensitivities. <br/>-<br/>-Later in the 18th century, one of the founders of modern [[utilitarianism]], the English philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]], argued that animal pain is as real and as morally relevant as human pain, and that "[t]he day may come when the rest of the animal creation may acquire those rights which never could have been witholden from them but by the hand of tyranny." <ref name=Bentham>Bentham, Jeremy. ''An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation'', 1789. Latest edition: Adamant Media Corporation, 2005.</ref> Bentham argued that the ability to suffer, not the ability to [[reason]], must be the benchmark of how we treat other beings. If the ability to reason were the criterion, many human beings, including babies and disabled people, would also have to be treated as though they were things, famously writing that:<br/>-<br/>-<blockquote>It may one day come to be recognized that the number of the legs, the villosity of the skin, or the termination of the ''[[Sacrum|os sacrum]]'' are reasons equally insufficient for abandoning a sensitive being to the same fate.</blockquote><br/>-<br/>-<blockquote>What else is it that should trace the insuperable line? Is it the faculty of reason or perhaps the faculty of [[Speech|discourse]]? But a full-grown [[horse]] or [[dog]] is beyond comparison a more rational, as well as more conversable animal, than an infant of a day or a week or even a month old. But suppose they were otherwise, what would it avail? The question is not, Can they reason?, nor Can they talk? but, Can they suffer? Why should the law refuse its protection to any sensitive being? The time will come when humanity will extend its mantle over everything which breathes ... <ref name=Bentham/></blockquote><br/>-<br/>-Also in the 18th century, [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] argued that animals have the same essence as humans, despite lacking the faculty of reason. Although he considered vegetarianism to be only supererogatory, he argued for consideration to be given to animals in morality, and he opposed [[vivisection]]. His critique of [[Kant]]ian ethics contains a lengthy and often furious polemic against the exclusion of animals in his moral system, which contained the famous line: "Cursed be any morality that does not see the essential unity in all eyes that see the sun." {{fact}}<br/>-<br/>-The world's first animal welfare organization, the [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]], was founded in Britain in 1824, and similar groups soon sprang up elsewhere in [[Europe]] and then in [[North America]]. The first such group in the United States, the [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]], was chartered in the state of [[New York]] in 1866.<br/>-<br/>-The concept of animal rights became the subject of an influential book in 1892, ''Animals' Rights: Considered in Relation to Social Progress'', by [[England|English]] social reformer [[Henry Salt]], who had formed the Humanitarian League a year earlier, with the objective of banning hunting as a sport.<br/>-<br/>-By the late 20th century, animal welfare societies and laws against cruelty to animals existed in almost every country in the world. Specialized animal advocacy groups also proliferated, including those dedicated to the preservation of endangered species and others, like [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA), that protested against painful or brutal methods of hunting animals, the mistreatment of animals raised for human food in [[Factory farming|factory farms]], and the use of animals in experiments and entertainment.<br/>-<br/>-==History of the modern movement==<br/>-The modern animal rights movement can be traced to the early 1970s, and is one of the few examples of social movements that were created by philosophers, <ref name=EB1/> and in which they remain in the forefront. In the early 1970s, a group of [[Oxford University|Oxford]] philosophers began to question whether the moral status of non-human animals was necessarily inferior to that of human beings. <ref name=EB1/> This group included the psychologist [[Richard D. Ryder]], who coined the phrase "[[speciesism]]" in 1970, first using it in a privately printed pamphlet <ref name=Ryder>Ryder, Richard D. [http://www.guardian.co.uk/animalrights/story/0,11917,1543799,00.html "All beings that feel pain deserve human rights"], ''The Guardian'', August 6, 2005</ref> to describe the assignment of value to the interests of beings on the basis of their membership of a particular species.<br/>-<br/>-Ryder became a contributor to the influential book ''Animals, Men and Morals: An Inquiry into the Maltreatment of Non-humans'', edited by Roslind and Stanley Godlovitch and John Harris, and published in 1972. It was in a review of this book for the ''[[New York Review of Books]]'' that Peter Singer, now Ira W. DeCamp Professor of [[Bioethics]] at the University Center for Human Values at [[Princeton University|Princeton]], put forward the basic arguments, based on [[utilitarianism]], that in 1975 became ''Animal Liberation'', the book often referred to as the "bible" of the animal rights movement.<br/>-<br/>-In the 1980s and 1990s, the movement was joined by a wide variety of academic and professional groups, including theologians, lawyers, physicians, psychologists, psychiatrists, veterinarians, <ref name=EB3/> pathologists, and former vivisectionists. <br/>-<br/>-Other books regarded as ground-breaking include [[Tom Regan]]'s, ''The Case for Animal Rights'' (1983); James Rachels's, ''Created from Animals: The Moral Implications of Darwinism'' (1990); and Steven M. Wise's, ''Rattling the Cage: Toward Legal Rights for Animals (2000)''. <ref name=EB3/><br/>-<br/>-==Philosophy of the modern movement==<br/>-{{alib}}<br/>-Animal rights is the concept that all or some animals are entitled to possess their own lives; that they are deserving of, or already possess, certain [[moral]] rights; and that some basic rights for animals ought to be enshrined in law. The animal-rights view rejects the concept that animals are merely [[capital goods]] or [[property]] intended for the benefit of humans. The concept is often confused with [[animal welfare]], which is the philosophy that takes cruelty towards animals and animal suffering into account, but that does not assign specific moral rights to them.<br/>-<br/>-The animal-rights [[philosophy]] does not necessarily maintain that human and non-human animals are equal. For example, animal-rights advocates do not call for [[voting rights]] for chickens.  Some activists also make a distinction between [[sentient]] or self-aware animals and other life forms, with the belief that only sentient animals, or perhaps only animals who have a significant degree of self-awareness, should be afforded the right to possess their own lives and bodies, without regard to how they are valued by humans. Others would extend this right to all animals, even those without developed [[nervous system]]s or self-[[consciousness]]. {{fact}} Activists maintain that any human being or institution that commodifies animals for [[food]], [[entertainment]], [[cosmetics]], [[clothing]], [[animal testing]], or for any other reason, infringes upon the animals' right to possess themselves and to pursue their own ends.<br/>-<br/>-Few people would deny that non-human [[great apes]] are intelligent and aware of their own condition and goals, and may become frustrated when their freedoms are curtailed. In contrast, animals like [[jellyfish]] have simple nervous systems, and may be little more than automata, capable of basic reflexes but incapable of formulating any ends to their actions or plans to pursue them, and equally unable to notice whether they are in captivity. There is as yet no consensus with regard to which qualities make a living organism an animal in need of rights. The animal-rights debate, much like the [[abortion]] debate, is therefore marred by the difficulty that its opponents search for simple, clear-cut distinctions on which to base moral and political judgements, even though the biological realities of the problem present no hard and fast boundaries on which such distinctions could be based. From a [[neurobiology|neurobiological]] perspective, jellyfish, farmed chicken, laboratory mice, or pet cats would fall along different points on a complex spectrum from the "nearly vegetable" to the "highly sentient".<br/>-<br/>-Opponents of animal rights have attempted to identify the morally relevant differences between humans and animals that might justify the attribution of rights and interests to the former but not to the latter. Various distinguishing features of humans have been proposed, including the possession of a [[soul]], the ability to use [[language]], [[self-consciousness]], a high level of [[intelligence]], and the ability to recognize the [[right]]s and interests of others. However, such criteria face the difficulty that they do not seem to apply to all and only humans: each may apply either to some but not to all humans or to all humans but also to some animals.<br/>-<br/>-===Different approaches===<br/>-Peter Singer and Tom Regan are the best-known proponents of animal liberation, though they differ in their philosophical approaches. Another influential thinker is [[Gary L. Francione]], who presents an [[abolitionist]] view that non-human animals should have the basic right not to be treated as the property of humans.<br/>-<br/>-====Utilitarian approach====<br/>-Although Singer is the ideological founder of today's animal-rights movement, his approach to an animal's moral status is not based on the concept of rights, but on the [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] principle of [[equal consideration of interests]]. His 1975 book ''[[Animal Liberation]]'' argues that humans grant moral consideration to other humans not on the basis of intelligence (in the instance of children, or the mentally disabled), on the ability to moralize (criminals and the insane), or on any other attribute that is inherently human, but rather on their ability to experience ''suffering''. <ref name=Singer>Singer, Peter. ''Animal Liberation'', 1975; second edition, New York: Avon Books, 1990, ISBN 0940322005</ref> As animals also experience suffering, he argues, excluding animals from such consideration is a form of discrimination known as "[[speciesism]]."<br/>-<br/>-Singer argues that the way in which humans use animals is not justified, because the benefits to humans are negligible compared to the amount of animal suffering they necessarily entail, and because the same benefits can be obtained in ways that do not involve the same degree of suffering. <br/>-<br/>-====Rights-based approach====<br/>-Tom Regan (''The Case for Animal Rights'' and ''[[Empty Cages]]'') argues that non-human animals, as "subjects-of-a-life," are bearers of rights like humans. He argues that, because the moral rights of humans are based on their possession of certain [[Cognition|cognitive]] abilities, and because these abilities are also possessed by at least some non-human animals, such animals must have the same moral rights as humans.<br/>-<br/>-Animals in this class have "inherent value" as individuals, and cannot be regarded as means to an end. This is also called the "direct duty" view. According to Regan, we should abolish the breeding of animals for food, animal experimentation, and commercial hunting. Regan's theory does not extend to all sentient animals but only to those that can be regarded as "subjects-of-a-life." He argues that all normal mammals of at least one year of age would qualify in this regard.<br/>-<br/>-While Singer is primarily concerned with improving the treatment of animals and accepts that, at least in some hypothetical scenarios, animals could be legitimately used for further (human or non-human) ends, Regan believes we ought to treat animals as we would persons, and he applies the strict [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] idea that they ought never to be sacrificed as mere means to ends, and must be treated as ends unto themselves. Notably, Kant himself did not believe animals were subject to what he called the moral law; he believed we ought to show compassion, but primarily because not to do so brutalizes human beings, and not for the sake of animals themselves.<br/>-<br/>-Despite these theoretical differences, both Singer and Regan agree about what to do in practise. For example, they agree that the adoption of a [[veganism|vegan]] diet and the abolition of nearly all forms of [[animal testing]] are ethically mandatory.<br/>-<br/>-=====Rights require obligations=====<br/>-Critics such as Carl Cohen, professor of philosophy at the University of Michigan and the University of Michigan Medical School, oppose the granting of personhood to animals. Cohen wrote in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' in October 1986: that "[t]he holders of rights must have the capacity to comprehend rules of duty governing all, including themselves. In applying such rules, the holders of rights must recognize possible conflicts between what is in their own interest and what is just. Only in a community of beings capable of self-restricting moral judgments can the concept of a right be correctly invoked." <br/>-<br/>-Cohen rejects [[Peter Singer]]'s argument that since a brain-damaged human could not exhibit the ability to make moral judgments, that moral judgments cannot be used as the distinguishing characteristic for determining who is awarded rights. Cohen states that the test for moral judgment "is not a test to be administered to humans one by one."<ref> {{cite journal | last = Cohen| first = Carl| | year = 1986| month = October| title = The Case for the Use of Animals in Biomedical Research| journal = [[New England Journal of Medicine]]| volume = 315| issue = 14| pages = 865-70| id = PMID 3748104}}</ref><br/>-<br/>-The British philosopher [[Roger Scruton]] has argued that rights can only be assigned to beings who are able to understand them and to reciprocate by observing their own obligations to other beings. Scruton also argues against animal rights on practical grounds.

Only human beings are capable of exercising moral judgment and recognizing the rights of one another. Animals do not exercise responsibility as moral agents. They do not recognize the rights of other animals. They kill and eat one another instinctively, as a matter of survival. They act from a combination of conditioning, fear, instinct and intelligence, but they do not exercise moral judgment in the process." {{fact}}<!--what is the Foundation for Animal Use?--><br/>-<br/>-In ''The Animals Issue: Moral Theory in Practice'', the British philosopher Peter Carruthers argues that humans have obligations only to other beings who can take part in a hypothetical [[social contract]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Carruthers| first =  Peter| | title = The Animals Issue: Moral Theory in Practice| edition = | date = 1992| publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]| id = ISBN 0521436893|pages = pp. 90-2}}</ref> thus animals are excluded from the group of beings to whom humans have moral obligations. <ref>{{cite book | last = Carruthers| first =  Peter| | title = The Animals Issue: Moral Theory in Practice| edition = | date = 1992| publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]| id = ISBN 0521436893|pages = pp. 141-3}}</ref><br/>-<br/>-====Abolitionist view====<br/>-[[Gary Francione]]'s work (''Introduction to Animal Rights'', et.al.) is based on the premise that if non-human animals are considered to be property then any rights that they may be granted would be directly undermined by that property status. He points out that a call to equally consider the interests of your property against your own interests is absurd. Without the basic right not to be treated as the property of humans, non-human animals have no rights whatsoever, he says. Francione posits that sentience is the only valid determinant for moral standing, unlike Regan who sees qualitative degrees in the subjective experiences of his "subjects-of-a-life" based upon a loose determination of who falls within that category. Francione claims that there is no actual animal-rights movement in the United States, but only an [[animal welfare|animal-welfarist]] movement. In line with his philosophical position and his work in animal-rights law for the Animal Rights Law Project [http://animal-law.org] at [[Rutgers University]], he points out that any effort that does not advocate the abolition of the property status of animals is misguided, in that it inevitably results in the institutionalization of animal exploitation. It is logically inconsistent and doomed never to achieve its stated goal of improving the condition of animals, he argues. Francione holds that a society which regards dogs and cats as family members yet kills cows, chickens, and pigs for food exhibits what he calls "moral schizophrenia".<br/>-<br/>-==Animal rights in [[law]]==<br/>-[[Image:600-restraint-tube4.jpg|left|thumb|350px|A monkey in a restraint tube filmed by [[PETA]] in a [[Covance]] branch, [[Vienna, Virginia]], 2004-5 [http://www.covancecruelty.com/photos.asp] ]]<br/>-<br/>-Animals are protected under the [[law]], but in general their individual rights have no protection. There are [[criminal law]]s against cruelty to animals, laws that regulate the keeping of animals in cities and on farms, the transit of animals internationally, as well as quarantine and inspection provisions. These laws are designed to protect animals from unnecessary physical harm and to regulate the use of animals as food. In the [[common law]], it is possible to create a [[charitable trust]] and have the trust empowered to see to the care of a particular animal after the death of the benefactor of the trust. Some individuals create such trusts in their [[will (law)|will]]. Trusts of this kind can be upheld by the [[court]]s if properly drafted and if the [[testator]] is of sound mind. There are several movements in the UK campaigning to require the [[British parliament]] to award greater protection to animals. The legislation, if passed, will introduce a [[duty]] of care, whereby a keeper of an animal would commit an offence if he or she fails to take reasonable steps to ensure an animal’s welfare. This concept of giving the animal keeper a duty towards the animal is equivalent to granting the animal a right to proper welfare. The draft bill is supported by an [[RSPCA]] campaign.<br/>-<br/>-Laws prohibiting cruelity against animals were not uncommon in ancient India. For example, the [[Maurya]]n emperor [[Ashoka]] [[Edicts of Ashoka#Respect for animal life|issued laws]] to protect several animals,  prohibited gratituous killing of all animals, condemned violent acts against animals, and [[Edicts of Ashoka#Social and Animal welfare|provided facilities]] for their welfare. The first anti-cruelty law in the West was included in the legal code of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] in 1641. <ref name=EB3/> In 1822, the British parliament adopted the Martin Act, which forbade the "cruel and improper Treatment" of large domestic animals. <ref name=EB3/> The ''Tierschutzgesetz'' was passed in Germany in 1933 by the [[National Socialism|National Socialist]] government. [[Switzerland]] passed legislation in 1992 to recognize animals as beings, rather than things, and the protection of animals was enshrined in the [[Germany|German]] constitution in 2002, when its upper house of parliament voted to add the words "and animals" to the clause in the constitution obliging the state to protect the "natural foundations of life ... in the interests of future generations." <ref name=CNN1/> [http://www.ebra.org/bulletin/win05_02.html]<br/>-<br/>-The State of [[Israel]] has banned dissections of animals in elementary and secondary schools; performances by trained animals in circuses; and has banned production of [[foie gras]].

Foremost among these is [[factory farming]], [http://www.meetyourmeat.com/wycd.html]<br/>-which produces the majority of [[meat]], [[dairy product]]s, and [[egg (food)|eggs]] in Western industrialized nations. The transportation of farm animals for slaughter, which often involves their [[live export]], has in recent years been a major issue of campaigning for animal-rights groups, particularly in the [[United Kingdom|UK]].<br/>-<br/>-The vast majority of animal-rights advocates adopt [[vegetarian]] or [[vegan]] diets; they may also avoid clothes made of animal skins, such as [[leather]] shoes, and will not use products such as [[cosmetics]], [[pharmaceutical]] products, or certain [[ink]]s or [[dye]]s known to contain animal [[byproduct]]s. Goods containing ingredients that have been tested on animals are also avoided where possible. Company-wide [[boycott]]s are common. The [[Procter & Gamble]] corporation, for example, [[Animal testing|tests]] many of its products on animals, leading many animal-rights supporters to boycott all of their products, including food like peanut butter.<br/>-<br/>-Many animal-rights advocates dedicate themselves to educating and persuading the public. Some organizations, like ''[[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]]'', strive to do this by garnering media attention for animal-rights issues, often using outrageous stunts or advertisements to obtain media coverage for a more serious message.<br/>-<br/>-There is a growing trend in the American animal-rights movement towards devoting all resources to vegetarian outreach. The 9.8 billion animals killed there for food use every year far exceeds the number of animals being exploited in other ways. Groups such as ''[[Vegan Outreach]]'' and ''[[Compassion Over Killing]]'' devote their time to exposing factory-farming practices by publishing information for consumers and by organizing undercover investigations.<br/>-<br/>-A growing number of animal-rights activists engage in [[direct action]]. This typically involves the removal of animals from infiltrated facilities that use them or the damage of property at such facilities in order to cause financial loss. A number of incidents have involved [[violence]] or the threat of violence toward animal [[Vivisection|experimenters]] or associates involved in the use of animals. More extreme activists have attempted [[blackmail]] and other illegal activities to help aid their cause, such as the indimidation campaign to close Darley Oaks farm, which involved [[hate mail]], malicious phonecalls, [[hoax]] bombs, [[arson]] attacks and property destruction, climaxing with the theft of Gladys Hammond's body (the owners' mother-in-law) from a Staffordshire grave. Some of the groups like the ALF and ELF have been regarded as [[terrorist]] groups by countries like USA and UK with more than thousand attacks in one year causing £2.6m of damage to property in the UK alone prompting some experts to state that animal rights now tops the list of causes which prompt violence in the UK.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/902751.stm Animal rights, terror tactics] - [[BBC News]]</ref> Most animal welfare groups condemned the attacks.<br/>-<br/>-There are also a growing number of "[[open rescue]]s," in which animal-rights advocates enter businesses to steal animals without trying to hide their identities. Open rescues tend to be carried out by committed individuals who are willing to go to jail if prosecuted, but so far no factory-farm owner has been willing to press charges, perhaps because of the negative publicity that would ensue. However some countries like Britain have proposed stricter laws to curb animal extremists.

In 2003, PETA organized a touring exhibition titled "Holocaust on your Plate," which mixed imagery of Jews in concentration camps with animals being killed and abused.

In the 1930s, the [[Nazi]]s used photographs of [[kosher]] slaughter as part of their campaign to inflame anti-Jewish sentiment. More recently, former [[Ku Klux Klan]] leader [[David Duke]] supported the [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) campaign against the practice of kosher slaughter in the United States[http://www.davidduke.com/?p=195]. <br/>-<br/>-Kathleen Kete, associate professor of history at Trinity College, Cambridge, argues that there is a link between the anti-vivisection movement and anti-Semitism. <br/>-<br/>-"Anti-vivisectionists saw vivisection as the extreme expression of European rationalism. It represented the evils of modernity. In some circles in Switzerland and Germany, an earlier representation of modernity and its dangers—the Jew—merged with the image of the scientist. "Jewish science" was targeted by anti-vivisectionists and "Jewish" treatment of animals—evidenced in kosher butchering, and countered by vegetarianism —was deplored."[http://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/4/KathleenKete.php]<br/>-<br/>-The Nazis, argues Kete, brought in the most comprehensive animal protection laws in Europe including the banning of kosher slaughter. Vivisecton was chacterized as "Jewish" and banned. (Arnold Arluke and Boria Sax, "Understanding Nazi Animal Protection and the Holocaust", ''Anthrozoos'' 5(1):6-31; 1992) <br/>-<br/>-Arluke and Sax argue that Nazi animal protection measures "may have been a legal veil to level an attack on the Jews. In making this attack, the Nazis allied themselves with animals since both were portrayed as victims of 'oppressors' such as Jews.' Composer [[Richard Wagner]] urged attacks on laboratories and physical assault on vivisectionists, whom he associated with Jews-presumably because of kosher killing methods.[http://www.counterpunch.org/cockburn08182005.html]<br/>-<br/>-"Nazi German identity," Arluke and Sax conclude, "relied on the blurring of boundaries between humans and animals and the constructing of a unique phylogenetic hierarchy that altered conventional human­animal distinctions and imperatives. . .As part of the natural order, Germans of Aryan stock were to be bred like farm stock, while "lower animals" or "subhumans", such as the Jews and other victims of the Holocaust, were to be exterminated like vermin as testament to the new "natural" and biological order conceived under the Third Reich."<br/>-<br/>-==Animal rights and human rights==<br/>-[[Robert Bidinotto]], a writer on environmental issues, said in a 1992 speech to the Northeastern Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies: "Strict observance of animal rights forbids even direct protection of people and their values against nature's many predators. Losses to people are acceptable ... losses to animals are not. Logically then, beavers may change the flow of streams, but Man must not. Locusts may denude hundreds of miles of plant life ... but Man must not.

The overall perspective is poor. As the note at the top implies, it is largely a history of the Zionist movement, and that is not sufficinet for an article with the general title Zionism. It has a disputable linear perspective, "from King David to David Ben-Gurion" . The article would benefit from more theory, and more history other then Jewish history. It needs more background on Jews in 19th-century Europe,, and an explanation of why Zionism grew from a minority to a majority opinion among them. (Remember that Zionists said that millions of people should simply migrate to another continent, a far-reaching proposal). Peer review would open up the editing to a wider group, which this article badly needs.[[User:Paul111|Paul111]] 11:09, 24 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+:This article will never be NPOV if there isn't a balance between sources. Currently, all sources are Israelis or at least western. Arab sources should consist of a great part in this article since this controversial subject is the center of discussion in the Arab world. [[User:Cedar-Guardian|CG]] 17:44, 25 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+The term "Zionism" was created by the Jews and is strongly linked to their history.

Reyes has represented the [[Spain national football team|Spanish national team]] in 20 matches, scoring 4 goals. <br/>-<br/>-==Biography==<br/>-===Early career===<br/>-Reyes joined the youth ranks of Seville club [[Sevilla FC]] at the age of 10.  His talent was identified at an early age, and he represented the club at all youth levels. He finally signed a full contract in 1999 at the age of 15.  Reyes made his senior debut at the age of 16 as a substitute in a game against [[Real Zaragoza]], and he was later called up to Spain's under-17 youth national team for the [[UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship|Under-17 European Championships]].<br/>-<br/>-Reyes established his reputation as a versatile [[Striker|forward]], playing either as a left [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] or a [[striker#Deep-lying forwards|support striker]].  He is a good [[Football (soccer) tactics and skills|passer]] and has strong [[dribbling#Association football|dribbling]] skills.  His 22 goals in 86 matches, over four seasons at Sevilla led to other clubs taking notice, but Reyes' popularity with the club's fans made a move to a bigger Spanish club politically difficult for Sevilla FC's club president.<br/>-<br/>-===Arsenal move===<br/>-Despite Sevilla manager [[Joaquín Caparrós]] wishing to hang onto him, Reyes signed with [[England|English]] club [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal FC]] during the January [[transfer window]] of the [[2003-04 in English football|2003-04 season]].  The £9m fee was negotiated with top ups, depending on the success of Arsenal, which could rise to £17m.<br/>-<br/>-He made his debut on [[February 1]], [[2004]] in a 2-1 win over [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]].  Two days later he scored an own goal against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] in the [[Carling Cup]]. Later that month, Reyes scored twice against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] to knock them out of the [[FA Cup]].  He also scored against Chelsea in the [[UEFA Champions League]] quarterfinal, and his goals in the penultimate two games of the season helped keep [[The Invincibles (football)|Arsenal's unbeaten run]] in the [[FA Premier League]] going.<br/>-<br/>-[[Hat trick]]s in [[friendly match|friendlies]] during the summer 2004 showed his improvement and Reyes was a prominent influence on Arsenal's impressive start to the [[2004-05 in English football|2004-05 season]], in which he managed to score in each of the first six games. However, Reyes struggled during the middle of the season after Arsenal's defeat by [[Manchester United]] at [[Old Trafford]], where he was perceived to be cynically kicked out of the game by [[Gary Neville]]. His inconsistent performance brought little reward for much of the season, and yet towards the end of this season he scored three valuable goals.<br/>-<br/>-===Phone Prank===<br/>-In early 2005 he was reported to be [[Homesickness|homesick]] while at Arsenal, even though José's parents Mari and Francisco as well as brother Jesús lived with him in England. During a prank call perpetrated by [[COPE]] Radio of Spain in February 2005, a prankster claiming to be the president of Spanish club [[Real Madrid]] reportedly called Reyes' agent and spoke to Reyes himself about a possible [[transfer deal]]. In the ensuing conversation, Reyes allegedly declared that life in [[London]] was far from what he had envisioned and he would not discount a welcoming move back to his native Spain to play for the team.  Reyes also supposedly said that he wanted out of the club as there were "bad people" at Arsenal.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/a/arsenal/4250173.stm Reyes tricked into Real admission], ''[[BBC Sport]]'', 11 February, 2005</ref> <br/>-<br/>-On [[May 21]] [[2005]], Reyes became the only second player in history (after [[Kevin Moran]]) to be sent off in an [[FA Cup]] final, when he was dismissed for a second yellow card.  Reyes continued in a similar vein in the [[2005-06 in English football|2005-06 season]], but has generally received praise for his gradually improving performances.<br/>-<br/>-He temporarily ended speculation about a move away from [[Highbury]] in July 2005, when he signed a new six-year contract and declared that he was "looking forward to having many more successful years at the club."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/a/arsenal/4687499.stm Reyes and Clichy sign new deals], ''[[BBC Sport]]'', 15 July, 2005</ref> <br/>-<br/>-In Arsenal's [[UEFA Champions League 2005-06|2005-06 UEFA Champions League]] run, Reyes featured heavily against, among others, Real Madrid, [[Juventus FC]] and [[Villarreal CF]], in the most impressive Champions League results for Arsenal to date. He came on as a substitute in the May 17, 2006 final against Spanish champions [[F.C. Barcelona]], which Arsenal lost 2-1. However, in August 2006 he expressed a desire not to play in Arsenal's [[UEFA Champions League 2006-07|2006-07 Champions League]] qualifying match against [[Dynamo Zagreb]] - to do so would render him '[[cup-tied]]' and complicate a move to Real Madrid.<ref>Graeme Bailey, [http://home.skysports.com/list.asp?hlid=407746&CPID=8&clid=3&lid=2&title=Reyes+pleads+not+to+play Reyes pleads not to play], ''[[Sky Sports]]'', 4 August 2006</ref><br/>-Wenger left him out of the team, thus fuelling speculation that Reyes could be on his way to Real Madrid.<br/>-<br/>-===Real Madrid loan===<br/>-Reyes was linked to Real Madrid along with Arsenal teammate [[Cesc Fàbregas]] in the summer of 2006, when the candidate [[Arturo Baldasano]] of the then on-going Real Madrid presidential campaign claimed he would sign them, if elected.<ref>[http://football.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/0,,1807020,00.html United deny Ronaldo exit], ''[[Guardian Unlimited]]'', [[June 27]], [[2006]]</ref> Reyes further hinted towards a transfer to Real Madrid. After making two official statements on Arsenal's website denying media reports of being unhappy, alleged quotes from Reyes in the Spanish press contradicted his denials. This tested the patience of [[Arsene Wenger]], who reacted angrily to Real Madrid's attempts to unsettle his player, suggesting that it was not the first time Real Madrid had used the media and agents in Spain as a destabilising tactic to unsettle players contracted to rival clubs. [[Atletico Madrid]] made an opening bid esitmated at £8.1million for Jose Reyes, which Wenger deemed "an insult" to Arsenal.<ref>[http://www.teamtalk.com/football/story/0,16368,2483_1445823,00.html Wenger: Offer for Reyes an insult], ''[[TEAMtalk]]'', 2006</ref> After increasing their bid, it seemed likely that Reyes would join Atletico Madrid before the end of the transfer period, but reports then surfaced of a swap deal between Arsenal and Real Madrid, with Reyes heading to the Bernabeu and Brazilian forward [[Julio Baptista]] moving to London. The loan is only for one year with an option for Madrid to buy after one year. <br/>-<br/>-On [[August 31]], [[2006]] it was announced that a deal had been reached and that the transfer of Jose Antonio Reyes to Real Madrid had been completed, with Julio Baptista moving to Arsenal. He scored his first goal with Real Madrid on [[September 17]], [[2006]] on a free kick against Real Sociedad.<br/>-<br/>-==International Career==<br/>-Reyes earned his first full cap in September 2003 against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]].  However, he was left out of [[Iñaki Sáez]]'s [[2004 European Football Championship|2004 European Championship]] squad.  Although Reyes has been picked consistently in national team squads, he has only 20 caps and 4 goals. He is not a regular starter, due to current national team coach [[Luis Aragonés]]' preference to play [[Fernando Torres]], [[David Villa]], and [[Luis_Javier_Garc%C3%ADa_Sanz|Luis García]] up front.  Most recently, Reyes played in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] game against [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]].<br/>-<br/>-===Racism incident===<br/>-In October 2004, his relationship with Arsenal teammate [[Thierry Henry]] may have soured when Luis Aragonés, in an attempt to motivate Reyes during a training session, told him that he was "better than that black little shit Henry".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/4055395.stm Aragones fined for Henry remarks], ''[[BBC Sport]]'', 1 March, 2005</ref> Reyes himself did not respond to the remark. Reyes' and Henry's on-pitch behaviour towards each other, however, has indicated that they have patched up any differences.<br/>-Reyes himself is a member of the [[Gitano]] people ([[Spanish language|spanish]]: [[Gypsy]]).<br/>-<br/>-==Career stats==<br/>-:''(correct as of 13 July 2006)''<br/>-{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"<br/>-|-<br/>-!rowspan="2"|Club<br/>-!rowspan="2"|Season<br/>-!colspan="3"|League<br/>-!colspan="2"|Cup<br/>-!colspan="2"|Europe<br/>-!colspan="2"|Total<br/>-|-<br/>-!Apps!!Goals!!Assists!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals<br/>-|-<br/>-|rowspan="6" valign="top"|[[Sevilla FC]]<br/>-|[[La Liga season 1999/2000|1999-00]]<br/>-|1||0||?||-||-||-||-||1||0<br/>-|-<br/>-|[[Segunda División 2000/2001|2000-01]]<br/>-|1||0||?||1||0||-||-||2||0<br/>-|-<br/>-|[[La Liga season 2001/2002|2001-02]]<br/>-|29||8||?||1||0||-||-||30||8<br/>-|-<br/>-|[[La Liga season 2002/2003|2002-03]]<br/>-|34||9||?||3?||2?||-||-||37?||11?<br/>-|-<br/>-|[[La Liga season 2003/2004|2003-04]]<br/>-|21||5||?||4||1||-||-||25||6<br/>-|-<br/>-!Total<br/>-!86!!22!!?!!9?!!3?!!-!!-<br/>-!95?!!25?<br/>-|-<br/>-|rowspan="4" valign="top"|[[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal FC]]<br/>-|[[2003-04 in English football|2003-04]]<br/>-|13||2||1||4||2||4||1||21||5<br/>-|-<br/>-|[[2004-05 in English football|2004-05]]<br/>-|30||9||10||7||2||8||1||45||12<br/>-|-<br/>-|[[2005-06 in English football|2005-06]]<br/>-|26||5||10||6||1||12||0||44||6<br/>-|-<br/>-!Total<br/>-!69!!16!!21!!17!!5!!24!!2<br/>-!110!!23<br/>-|-<br/>-|rowspan="2" valign="top"|[[Real Madrid F.C.|Real Madrid]]<br/>-|[[La Liga season 2006/2007|2006-07]]<br/>-| 4 || 1 || - || - || - || 2 || 1 || 6 || 2<br/>-|-<br/>-!Total<br/>-!-!!-!!-!!-!!-!!-!!-<br/>-!-!!-<br/>-|-<br/>-!colspan="2"|Career total<br/>-!155!!38!!21?!!26?!!8?!!24!!2<br/>-!205?!!48?<br/>+{{future}}<br/>+{| class="infobox bordered" style="width: 25em; text-align: left; font-size: 95%;"<br/>+|+ style="font-size: larger;" | '''Eurovision Song Contest 2007'''<br/>+|-<br/>+| colspan="2" style="text-align:center;" |[[image: Helsinki_ESC_2007.jpg]]<br/>+|- <br/>+!

It will take place on [[May 10]] and [[May 12]], [[2007]], in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]]. Finland earned the right to host the event due to the [[rock music|rock band]] [[Lordi]] winning the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006]] as Finland's representatives. The victory in [[Athens]], [[Greece]] on the [[May 20]] [[2006]] was Finland's first in their [[Finland in the Eurovision Song Contest|history]] of competing in the Eurovision Song Contest. It also meant that the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 will be the first Eurovision Song Contest to be arranged in Finland. It was announced on [[June 21]], [[2006]], by the Finnish national broadcasting company [[YLE]], that the contest will be held at the [[Hartwall Areena]] in Helsinki.<br/>+<br/>+The Hartwall Areena, Finland's largest [[ice hockey]] arena, was always the favourite to be chosen to host the contest. The city of Helsinki has the best connections and facilities in the country, therefore allowing as many people as possible to experience the Eurovision Song Contest. A budget of [[Euro|€]]13 million was also presented for arranging the contest. Other bids to host the contest came from the [[Helsingin jäähalli]] (Helsinki ice hockey arena) in Helsinki, the [[Helsinki Fair Centre]] in Helsinki, [[VR Konepaja]] in Helsinki, [[LänsiAuto Areena]] in [[Espoo]], [[Suurhalli]] in [[Lahti]], [[Levi, Finland|Levi]] in Finnish [[Lapland]], [[Lappi Areena]] in [[Rovaniemi]], [[Pirkkahalli]] in [[Tampere]], [[Ratina stadium]] in Tampere, and [[Elysée Arena]] in [[Turku]], but they did not receive the honour <ref>http://www.yle.fi/uutiset/24h/id34905.html</ref><ref>http://www.doteurovision.com/phpnews/news.php?action=fullnews&id=1150</ref>. One week before the Hartwall Areena was chosen, [[Ville Vilén]], one of the managers responsible for the Eurovision Song Contest 2007, said that only venues with a capacity of 10,000 or more would be taken into consideration, thus ruling most of the cities to be out of contention <ref>http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/6267</ref>.<br/>+<br/>+During the Heads of Delegation meeting in [[March 2006]], it was announced that qualification for the 2007 final would change from previous years, so that only the top six placed countries from the 2006 final, along with the four largest financial contributors to the [[European Broadcasting Union|EBU]] (the Big Four) automatically qualified, with the remaining places being filled by the top fourteen placed countries from the 2007 semi-final. However, in a press conference just before the Eurovision Song Contest 2006, the EBU stated that these changes to the qualification system would not take place <ref>http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/6171</ref>, meaning that fourteen countries (the top ten placed countries from the 2006 final and the Big Four) automatically qualifying for the final, and ten others qualifying from the semi-final. The maximum number of countries allowed to participate will still be forty.<br/>+<br/>+The [[EBU Reference Group]] met in Helsinki in [[September 2006]], and are happy with the preparations for the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 <ref>http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/6375</ref>. [[Svante Stockselius]] suggested that there would be a record number of participating countries. Despite the fact that the maximum number of participating countries is forty, it is possible that there will be more than this. Though they did not participate in the Eurovision Song Contest 2006, the [[Czech Republic]], [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], and [[Austria]] have all confirmed that they will in 2007, and it seems likely that [[Azerbaijan]] will also show interest in entering. Therefore, if all of the entrants from the Eurovision Song Contest 2006 returned, then that would mean that at least forty-two countries would intend to participate.<br/>+==Participating countries==<br/>+Participating countries in a Eurovision Song Contest must be [[European Broadcasting Union#Full EBU members|active members]] of the EBU.<br/>+<br/>+The EBU will not confirm the paricipating countries until [[January 2007]]. However, no countries which participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 2006 have indicated that they do not intend on entering. Many countries are arranging the song selecting process, therefore, it is very likely that they will participate.<br/>+<br/>+[[Image:Eurovision2007.png|thumb|300px|right|'''The participating countries of the final should be:'''<br><br/>+{{legend|#00f|The top ten placed countries from the Eurovision Song Contest 2006 final}}{{legend|#f00|The Big Four}}<br><br/>+'''The participating countries of the semi-final could be:'''<br>{{legend|#0f0|Countries which did not automatically qualify for the final, having competed in the Eurovision Song Contest 2006}}{{legend|#0ff|Debutant countries}}{{legend|#f0f|Returning countries, possible debutant countries, possible returning countries and countries that could theoretically enter, but are unlikely to do so}}]]<br/>+===The final===<br/>+The participating countries of the final should be:<br/>+*the automatic qualifiers;<br/>+**the top ten placed countries from the Eurovision Song Contest 2006 final;<br/>+***{{FIN}} (placed 1st in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006#Final 2006-05-20|Eurovision Song Contest 2006 Final]])<br/>+***{{RUS}} (2nd)<br/>+***{{BIH}} (3rd)<br/>+***{{ROM}} (4th)<br/>+***{{SWE}} (5th)<br/>+***{{LTU}} (6th)<br/>+***{{UKR}} (7th)<br/>+***{{ARM}} (8th)<br/>+***{{GRE}} (9th)<br/>+***{{IRL}} (10th)<br/>+**the Big Four;<br/>+***{{FRA}} (22nd)<br/>+***{{GER}} (15th)<br/>+***{{ESP}} (21st)<br/>+***{{GBR}} (19th)<br/>+*the top ten placed countries from the 2007 semi-final.<br/>+In the event of automatic qualifiers withdrawing before the contest, then their places will be given to the next best placed country (or countries) from the 2006 Eurovision Song Contest final.

[[User:Dragons flight|Dragons flight]] 19:58, 22 April 2006 (UTC)<br/>-:I Agree.  Although on the Vandalism page people were removing the line because they felt removing is not Vandalism.

Even a towering plurality of one choice is unlikely to approach a supermajority of the whole.  Worse yet, all the interrelated questions being listed separately means that we could end up with an irrational  whole (for instance, removing vandalism warnings being allowed, but not non-vandalism warnings, unless they're valid, in which case you may remove them, right away but not as part of archival, or some such).  <br/>-<br/>-If the hope is to actually "settle the issue once and for all" rather than simply create ''Sturm und Drang'', may I suggest a winnowing-down approach?  Start with "can the removal of ''any'' warnings from one's own talk page ''ever'' be considered actionably wrong, whether or not it is discouraged?"  If the answer is no, then we're done, and status quo remains.  Also ask if vandalism warnings should be treated differently from other warnings.  Once these two questions are answered, ''then'' ask (separately for vandalism and other warnings, if the prior answer was yes) about the circumstances in which removal is not allowed.  --[[User:TreyHarris|TreyHarris]] 18:53, 23 April 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-:One thing is to make sure we include the stuff form [[Wikipedia_talk:Removing_warnings#Proposed_options]]<br/>-:Another thing is I Like having the choices is because it looks more like a spectrum of people. (Not a list of unrelated Options)  With ABCD these choices aren't competing with each other I would find consensus by seeing if A wins if not ad A&B and go with B.  If still not ad A&B&C and go with C if still not then add ABC&D to get D.  Or if you do it in reverse it should give the same result.  But remember we aren’t actually voting to take a tally so we don’t need a voting system.  We just need to get the fell of what we as a community want. We are voting to get an idea of the wishes of the community.  [[WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_a_democracy|Wikipedia is not a democracy]].  I think It doesn’t matter if the polls are set up right because we aren't actually voting for a tally we are voting to get a sense  of what we want.  Their is only a vote because So many people are involved that it would take forever to.  I didn’t actually set up [[Wikipedia_talk:Removing_warnings]] to vote but rather to sign under the statement that you most agree with and provide evidence to support it.  Voting is like everyone knows what they wand and we just need to find out what to go with.  Consensus is explain your points until we can get a policy that many people won't object to.  (that’s why you can say Support under multiple places or Ok with or really don't like.  yeah you could tactically vote but we are assuming good faith hear.  Somebody could vote for removing vandalism warnings is OK and removing non vandalism warnings is bad but why would somebody vote just to mess us up. If they did that we would all discredit the vote.)<br/>-:The reason we are having this pole in the first place so that people don’t remove waning and when you tell them to stop they point to the policy and say we cant agree whether to call it vandalism or not so it’s not really a rule. <small>—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:Yskyflyer|Yskyflyer]] ([[User talk:Yskyflyer|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Yskyflyer|contribs]]) {{{2|}}}.</small><!-- [Template:Unsigned] -->[[User:Yskyflyer|E-Bod]]--[[User:Yskyflyer|E-Bod]] 01:58, 24 April 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-:: Wikipedia not being a democracy was precisely my point.  If we had a very few options, it would become clear what the consensus was without tallying.  With so many, it is unlikely that the sort of supermajority that makes consensus obvious to all comers will arise.  So instead, someone (you?) will have to do the equivalent of "closing the debate", making a judgment call on the consensus—and then we fall into a dispute on whether the debate was properly closed.<br/>-<br/>-:: I've seen and participated in a lot of polls in the past few years, and the more options and the finer-grained the distinctions between them, the longer the debate takes, the more likely it is to fall into intractable disputes, and the less likely it is to arrive at a clear consensus.   --[[User:TreyHarris|TreyHarris]] 00:27, 24 April 2006 (UTC)<br/>-:::Your point makes sence It's just more fun to espress yourslef with more options and not become fustrated by the lack of choices(sorry about forgeting to sign)--[[User:Yskyflyer|E-Bod]] 01:58, 24 April 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-Does anyone think the process of elimination might work?

While a user may remove warning from their own page to hid a bad past a third party wouldn't have this reasons to remove the warning.  If somebody doesn’t trust third parties to remove warnings because they could be sock puppets or users with bad historis could make deals with other users of bad histories then one could want to vote for only admins to remove warnings.

I know it's not popular among the poll-makers but in the interest of balance there needs to be options for people to vote "it's my talk page and I'll do what I want to it". After all, the purpose of a warning is primarily to warn the person whose talk page it is, so some voters may feel that, once the warning is read and acknowledged, the warning may be deleted at will. Of course this defeats the secondary purpose, warning others that this person is a rulebreaker, but we have to be fair.

(also users can upgrade the warning obviously) And do you think it be a good idea to do this? [[User:Tutmosis|<small> - Tutmosis</small>]] 01:17, 22 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-==Misc thoughts==<br/>-:(This is a combination of my previous comments when the subject was previously discussed)<br/>-If removing warnings is regarded as vandalism or against policy, then good editors who receive an unjustified warning (either by accident or in bad faith) are put in an impossible position, leave the warning on their page, taging them as a vandal, or remove the warning, tagging them as a vandal/policy breaker in another way. I don't think vandals removing warnings is a major issue, if I spot someone vandalising an article, the first thing I do is check their contributions to see what other articles they might have attacked, so any edits to their own talk page would become apparent, so their removal of warnings becomes irrelevent. That said, I think it should be discouraged to simply remove warnings, as even good editors should check with the warning giver as to the reasoning. The other editor may agree and retract the warning, or may not (either because of disagreement/unavailablity or bad faith). In those cases, I would not object to the person adding a explaination comment to the warning, leaving for a short while, and then deleting the warning and comment in the same edit. Thus, there are a wide amount of reasons for removing warnings, some of which may be reasonable, some not, that I don't think it would be a good idea to label all removal or warnings as "vandalism" or "against policy", but simply state that it is discouraged. <br/>-<br/>-Also, classing "removing warnings" as vandalism, and a blockable offence, we could end up in the situation where a user gets blocked for removing a warning about removing a warning about a minor mistake/misunderstanding. The user on the receiving end may have realised their initial mistake, and want to contribute, but forcing them to wear a "dunce's cap" of vandalism warnings is not likely to improve matters and is making it less likely for them to do so.<br/>-<br/>-However, I do think that removal of valid warnings (especially without explaination) may be taken into account for subsequent warnings and/or blocking actions for continuining vandalism. Thus, if a vandal gets a {{tl|test}} warning, removes it, no action should be taken at that point, but if they vandalise again, a {{tl|test3}} would be acceptable.<br/>-<br/>-The main problem I have with treating removing warnings is vandalism is that it, like many other rules, gets overly enforced by many well meaning, but over-zealous RC patrolers. I've seen too many edit wars over user pages based on removing and re-inserting warnings, creating a revert war over what started as one mistake. Applying a policy of "removing any warnings is vandalism" has the common outcome of increasing tension, not reducing it. If we are to assume good faith, we should be welcoming at the same time as correcting any initial mistakes, not confrontational. <br/>-<br/>-In short, though, treating warning removal as an offence mainly disourages well meaning editors who have made mistakes. Vandals/disruptive editors are likely to be blocked for their non-talkpage behaviour regardless of whether they remove warnings or not, and are proable lost causes as far as being productive editors, wheras those that are affected by this are those that have behaved well enough elsewhere, and are more likely to become productive editors if their nose isn't rubbed into their mistakes. Regards, [[User:MartinRe|MartinRe]] 14:21, 22 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-:I think I largely agree (using weasel words here because it is a lot to digest all at once). Basically, I would say that the act of removing a warning by itself should never be the basis for action. The context of the removal should always be reviewed and considered. If the removal of a warning is part of a pattern of disruptive behavior, then the reaction should be proportionate to the seriousness of the disruption. It's hard (probably impossible) to write rules to cover such situations, so I think we need to trust other Wikipedians and the admins, as a group, to take appropriate actions. I think it is appropriate, if an editor has removed a warning without explanation or discussion, to discuss it with them, and to explain why such a removal is viewed by many Wikipedians as a problem. Speak softly, and keep that big stick behind your back until you really need to use it. :-) -- '''<font color="navy">[[User:Dalbury|Donald Albury]]</font><sup><font color="green">([[User talk:Dalbury|<font color="green">Talk]])</font></font></sup>''' 22:31, 22 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-=== Clean-up of IP talk pages ===<br/>-In discussing placing use of warnings on IP talk pages recently, I and another vandal fighter touched on a problem that has been irking me for some time - the state of some IP pages.  Given the IP can be used by more than one person and they may not have read the talk page, I feel at least one bright orange "You have new messages" banner while they are "testing", thus drawing attention to their talk page is a good idea. As a result, I think recent vandalising / testing behaviour should always be subject to a warning, even if there are plenty of other warnings on the page.<br/>-<br/>-However, the talk pages of some IPs are a problem. I don't want to spend my time cleaning them up or archiving them, but messages down the bottom might not be seen by a newbie and the whole effect is lost amongst warnings dated many months ago. <br/>-<br/>-Maybe a bot could clean them for us, removing any warnings that are say more than 1 month old, making sure there are sensigbel headings to navifate warnings, and placing a header as to how to review old warnings (I'd prefer suggesting go to history than setting up an archive specially) and maybe indicating what warnings have gone before.  I imagine a different header for IPs that have been blocked before, to those who have merely received a mild {{tl|test}} warning once or twice, and there probably needs to be a header in between.<br/>-<br/>-Examples: <br/>-#[[User talk:209.112.191.162]] - old warnings dating from March are surely no longer relevant, header is already in place.  There should be the header and the August 2006 section - no more.<br/>-#[[User talk:202.6.138.34/Archive]] - I did create an archive here, but is there any point?  The [[User talk:202.6.138.34|talk page for the IP]] is too long again.  Any message directed at the IP will be lost.  Note the IP is used by many individuals and so messages dating from a while ago are irrelevant.<br/>-#[[User talk:220.233.169.181]] and [[User talk:203.222.139.106]] - here are two random IP pages.

I note the present page though ([[User talk:203.33.181.52]]) is not too bad but warnings from June and July are probably not useful.<br/>-<br/>-My '''recommendation''' - we commission a bot to clean up IP pages, remove old warnings of > one month old, place an appropriate header depending on the number and level of warnings and existence of a previous header (ie existing header would be replaced each time, not accumulate).  We do not archive, but in the header refer interested readers to the history.  I think my proposal is within the existing guidelines at [[Wikipedia:Refactoring talk pages]] - readability is improved and meaning is preserved through the use of the header. [[User:Werdnabot]] could be used but I think my proposal is more than archiving and so a bot would need to operate differently for IP talk pages with warnings.--[[User:AYArktos|Arktos]] <sup>[[User_talk:AYArktos|talk]]</sup> 23:41, 22 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-:Didn't all IP talk pages used to get auto-cleaned entirely?

Sure, occasionally people will remove warnings from their talk page and, because no-one notices, they get warned with a {{tl|test}} instead of a {{tl|test3}}.  '''This is okay''', it's not a problem.  RC patrolling is not about getting people blocked as soon as possible; it's also about being a friendly representative of the community for newbies who may not really understand that vandalism is wrong, and if they vandalize for one or two more edits than they might have otherwise, then that's a small price to pay compared with people perceiving our community as unfriendly.  [[User:JYolkowski|JYolkowski]] // [[User talk:JYolkowski|talk]] 22:30, 23 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-::True, making this policy will not speed up RC patrol. If an RC patroller sees a vandal edit, and goes to the talkpage, and sees it's blank; they have two options, not look at the history, and give a level one warning, or look at the history and give a higher level warning depending if there were any previous warnings removed. '''This will remain the case whether removing warnings is against policy or not.''' The only time it will speed things up is if you are dealing with a person who ignores policy when it comes to vandalism, but obeys policy when it comes to not removing warnings, and I think that subset is vanishingly small. I know when I'm on Rc patrol and see vandalism, the '''first''' thing I do is check the persons contribution history to see what other articles they have edited in case other bad edits were missed. I would imagine any good RC patroller does the same. RC patrol is not a game, where the object is to spot vandalism, and warn with a strike 1/strike 2/they're blocked. The sole object of rc patrol is to protect the encyclopedia from vandalism, warnings and blockings are a means to that, but are not required. if a simple revert is enough, then great. If someone stops after getting a test1 warning (or warnings) then good. However, by saying that removing warnings is vandalism, you have then created a new offence, and thereby increased the level of "vandalism", which reduces the amount of time that can be spent on vandalism that really matters (i.e. main space) by creating an edit war over a vandal's user talk page.

Just look at the talk page to decide what warning to give. (Of course you must look at the contribution log before ''blocking''!)<br/>-<br/>-You seem to be worried that if that talk page is not fully intact, you might miss a previously given warning, and thereby issue a {{tl|test1}} when the target really deserves a {{tl|test3}}.

There may be extra vandalism in the meantime, but removal of recent vandalism warnings seems to be rare enough that this will hardly make any difference. <br/>-<br/>-Remember, there is a much, much more common case. Many people will revert vandalism without issuing a warning at all! If you didn't look at the contribution log, you might miss previous recent vandalism anyway, and just issue a {{tl|test1}} when maybe something higher was warranted. So non-uniformity in dealing with vandals is unavoidable. An extra case of non-uniformity here and there because of warning removal is a non-issue. You can try to make it policy that anyone reverting vandalism MUST issue a warning, but I seriously doubt that will fly.

The next RC patroller to come across a vandal who has recently vandalised will expect to see an appropriate warning. If there isn't one there we [[WP:AGF|assume good faith]], assuming that there has been no vandalisation from that IP and for the most parts we will be right - it is a waste of time to look back through the talk page history in 95% of cases. However in a few cases the person will continually remove any warnings that they are given and be repeatedly issued a {{tl|test1}} for their vandalism spree. If you are able to reinstate the original warnings and warn them not to remove them again they may well comply - it happens probobly half the time. Those that keep blanking the page in addition to vandalising will just get blocked for one or the other - no great loss.

I find the old vandalism by backtracking contributions whenever I revert a questionable edit. I often find that an editor has vandalized four or five articles in a short period, and that a couple of the vandalism edits have been reverted by other editors, who apparantly have not checked the contributions list, leaving some for me to take care of. I dutifully stick {{tl|subst:test}} templates on IP talk pages, adding them to my watch list. At least 95% of those never have any more activity. Quite frankly, I have recently been thinking that RC patrolling must have died off quite a bit, as I do not see RC patrollers catching most of the vandalism that occurs on articles already on my watch list. Criminalizing removal of warnings from a talk page is not going to make Wikipedia safer from vandalism, but it is going to lower the level of discourse and waste a lot of time that could be better used in adding to and maintaining Wikipedia. -- '''<font color="navy">[[User:Dalbury|Donald Albury]]</font><sup><font color="green">([[User talk:Dalbury|<font color="green">Talk]])</font></font></sup>''' 01:19, 24 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-::Whenever I do RC patrol, one of the things I continually check is the contributions of the users whom I rollback (as suggested at [[WP:VAND]].

[[User:JYolkowski|JYolkowski]] // [[User talk:JYolkowski|talk]] 02:10, 24 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-== Contradictory guidelines/policies ==<br/>-<br/>-Thus far [[Wikipedia:Removing_warnings_poll#The_warning_should_always_be_restored_and_an_additional_warning_about_removing_warnings_added|28 people]] support the idea of forcibly re-adding removed warnings to user talk pages. IMO this is a direct contradiction of Wikipedia policies on edit warring and harassment - and the primary problem I have with this proposal. In the past ArbCom has banned users for repeatedly re-inserting messages that someone didn't want on their page... because it is an obvious form of harassment. Further, warnings are entirely too subjective - I saw one case where a user put a <nowiki>{{welcomenpov}}</nowiki> template on a talk page which already HAD a welcome template... and then when the user removed it that was reverted and a 'do not remove warnings' template added. What possible harm could the removal of that template have done? NPOV is often in the eyes of the beholder... likewise content disputes frequently get mislabeled as 'vandalism' and I've seen people edit war over such false 'vandalism' tags several times too. I think it is a horrible idea to '''sanction''' edit warring and repeated harassment of users to ''force'' them to display a 'Wikipedia scarlet letter' on their talk page because ''one'' person thinks they violated NPOV, or vandalism, or any other policy. We can say that such tags can be removed if they are 'not valid', but the line between 'improper removal of warnings which can get you blocked for 'hiding' things' and 'improper re-insertion of warnings which can get you blocked for harassment and edit warring' is then just a matter of personal interpretation of whether the warning was 'proper' or not. That's WAY too much room for inconsistency and abuse IMO. Harassing users by repeatedly inserting a message they clearly find insulting is just dead wrong. It serves no good purpose (and no, the extra second saved by not having to click 'History' is ''not'' a good purpose) and does tremendous harm in aggravating users needlessly... whether they be vandals or valued contributors. --[[User talk:CBDunkerson|CBD]] 11:51, 24 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-::Personally, I do not know how to take only one second to review a history. It can take much much longer.  I think that this is a very important matter.   So do most other editors.  I agree that edit warring is a bad idea, but avoiding conflicts at all costs allows bullies to win more often than not -- and that is the essence of the problem with your proposal.  Both proposals have problems but clearly editors believe that the problems you have mentioned are LESS than the problems of vandals and disruptive users.  (Many feel that there is a crying need for greater discipline on wikipedia)  So its a matter of choosing the lesser of two evils.  However, the policy might be improved by some compromises such as:<br/>-<br/>-::1. Expedited review by admins if the warning is disputed.<br/>-::2. Provision that edit warring by an editor who wrongly places warnings could result in warnings and actions against him or her.<br/>-::3. Revision of the software to have a third page - a warning page.<br/>-::4. Warnings may only be placed by certain users OR certain users may not be permitted to put warnings out.<br/>-<br/>-::Bottom line:  Wikipedia is self creating, self organizing and SELF POLICING.  We can set up the rules in such a way that they can take care of the problems of vandalism and still avoid the evils of one annoying or vengeful user taking actions against another, or two users being in a fight.

Edits wars are destructive, and edit warring over someone's talk page in order to force them to wear a dunces cap of a vandalism waring is '''creating a conflict where none existed'''. If you spot someone removing a warning, simply check if they have continued to vandalise. If they have stopped, then the warning worked, so the problem was solved - so why restart and escalate a conflict by commencing an edit war? If they have continued to vandalise, then warn them again - based on the vandalism they have done. We should remember that the primary object of issuing a warning is to stop vandalism. It is preventitive, not punitive, and if a person reads and removes a warning and gets the message by stopping, then that should be it.

(in this case -> "no edit warring".)<br/>-::: *  Patroller gets sanctioned, admin gets told to be more polite in future.<br/>-<br/>-::: The old method was to look in page history, warn the vandal 4 times, and then find an admin to block them.

Thus, the restoration of legitimate vandalism warnings is exempted from the [[WP:3RR|three revert rule]]  by the plain language of the policy.  Furthermore, even given a very narrow reading of [[Wikipedia:Ignore all rules]], this principle indicates that policies, such as the [[WP:3RR|three revert rule]], should '''not''' be applied in a manner that is actively disruptive to the proper functioning of Wikipedia.  I highly doubt that a significant number of administrators would choose to compromise the integrity of Wikipedia by repeatedly blocking RC patrollers instead of blocking the vandals, thereby crippling Wikipedia's defenses against vandalism, and allowing vandals to continue their destructive edits unimpeded. [[User:John254|John254]] 17:56, 24 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-:::The 3RR rule is there because edit wars are disruptive. If a rc patroller repeatedly edit wars over a user talk page, then they proably deserve to get blocked, because there is no need for it. If the person who has been warned removes the message, and stops vandalising, then the warning worked, and the matter should be laid to rest. Starting an edit war to force the vandal wear a badge of shame is unhelpful and disruptive. However, if the vandal continues after removing the warning, then you are perfectly entitled to warn them again - but for the mainspace ("real") vandalism, but classing warning removal as vandalism just gives over zealous people another stick to beat people who may have acknowledged their error but don't want it staring them in the face all the time. By harrassing those that correct their behaviour after the first warning, you are driving potentially good editors away. Assume good faith should mean that we correct people's mistake, but not in a confrontational way. If a new editor makes a mistake/vandalises and is corrected, they may improve, but if the response they get is to be told that "your mistake will be held against you for all time as you can't remove that warning", they are very likely to acquire a negative view of wikipedia. Rc patrollers do see a lot of vandals, but they also see potentially useful editors who may vandalise because they don't know better at the beginning, and it is just as important to encourage the good ones as it is to discourage the bad ones.

Michigan was the only team in the Big Ten without a loss 4 games into the Big Ten season, and despite an early nonconference loss at [[Washington Huskies|Washington]], the Wolverines were considered national title contenders.

The Spartans lined up two wide receivers and faked the punt.  The pass was incomplete; however, Michigan safety Brandon Williams was called for a costly pass interference call that gave MSU a fresh set of downs and 15 extra yards.  Two plays later, Jeff Smoker threw a touchdown to Charles Rogers in the back of the endzone to give the Spartans a 7-0 lead.<br/>-<br/>-On the ensuing drive, Michigan kicker [[Hayden Epstein]] nailed a beautiful 57 yard field goal to put the Wolverines on the board 7-3.<br/>-<br/>-===2nd Quarter===<br/>-At 12:07 of the 2nd quarter Michigan took its first lead on a 14 yard touchdown pass from [[John Navarre]] to [[Marquise Walker]], making the score 10-7.<br/>-<br/>-On 3rd and 4, 7:45 into the 2nd quarter, the Spartans were driving on the Wolverines 12.5 yard line.  Jeff Smoker threw an incomplete pass to Charles Rogers in the endzone, but Michigan was called for another pass interference call.  The penalty gave MSU first and goal, and on the very next play, T. J. Duckett ran 2 yards up the middle putting MSU up 14-10.  The costly penalty by [[Cato June]] likely gave the Spartans a touchdown instead of a field goal.  Michigan, the least penalized team in the Big Ten until that point, was allowing the Spartans to hang around.<br/>-<br/>-===3rd Quarter===<br/>-The Wolverines struck back on the next series, as Marquise Walker caught a 32 yard touchdown pass to give Michigan the lead, 17-14.<br/>-<br/>-Michigan State had its own penalty trouble - 4:21 into the second half a touchdown by T.

The kick was high and short, giving the Spartans excellent field position at their opponent's 44 yard line.  On first down, MSU quarterback Jeff Smoker was sacked at midfield by defensive end Shantee Orr for the Wolverines' 10th sack of the game.  Two incompletions later, the Spartans faced 4th-and-16 with just 1:25 left in regulation.<br/>-<br/>-[[Image:Pl8-2001-scoreboard2.jpg|right|175px]]<br/>-On fourth down, Smoker's pass was ruled incomplete, but a pass interference penalty on Michigan defensive back Jeremy LeSueur negated a turnover-on-downs and gave the Spartans new life.  Michigan State was awarded fifteen yards and an automatic first down on LeSueur's mistake, and, two plays later, wide receiver Herb Haygood caught a pass over the middle for 13 yards and another first down.<br/>-<br/>-On first and 10, Smoker is sacked again by the Wolverine defense.  As the players turned to walk off the field, Michigan State used its last remaining timeout, but, unbeknownst to both teams, a flag has been thrown against the Wolverines for too many men on the field.  With 36 seconds remaining, the illegal participation call resulted in half the distance to the goal being marked off.  The penalty should have automatically stopped the clock, but it continued to run.  Michigan State was forced to call a timeout during the penalty, burning the Spartans' last timeout.  On 2nd-and-4, LeSueur atoned for his earlier penalty by breaking up a pass to Duckett to bring up 3rd-and-4.  After an incompletion in the back of the endzone, Smoker completed a slant up the middle to T. J. Duckett for first and goal on the Michigan 3-yard-line.<br/>-<br/>-[[Image:Pl8-2001-scoreboard3.jpg|right]]<br/>-MSU rushed to spike the ball to stop the clock at 0:17, after which Michigan used a timeout.  On second and goal, Jeff Smoker rolled to the right and ran the ball down to the 1 yard line, but stayed inbounds so the clock continued to run.  With under 10 seconds left the Spartans frantically lined up to spike the ball, leaving the clock with 1 second on it.  Jeff Smoker took the final snap of the game, and after failing to locate an open receiver, he lobbed a pass into the endzone where T. J. Duckett made the reception, giving the Spartans a 26-24 victory.<br/>-<br/>-==The controversy==<br/>-Debates on the last remaining second continue to this day.  Michigan fans contend that the clock operator, known colloquially as "Spartan Bob," could not have stopped the clock that quickly or purposely stopped the clock to give the Spartans one more play.

Again, welcome!&nbsp; Regards, [[User:Accurizer|Accurizer]] 21:55, 25 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+There is a distinct difference between interior decorating and [[interior design]].  Interior decorating is generally focused on finishes, such as [[wallpaper]], [[paint]], [[window covering]]s, and [[furnishing]]s.  Interior design involves manipulating the [[architectural]] integrity of the interior space as well as the creation of a lifestyle experience through the study of human behavior.<br/>+<br/>+== History ==<br/>+The role of interior decorator probably came into existence in the 1720s in [[Western Europe]], though it was filled by men of diverse backgrounds.  Although [[William Kent]] trained as a [[history painter]], he if often cited as the first individual to take charge of an entire interior,  including internal architecture, furniture selection, and the hanging of paintings. <br/>+<br/>+In London, this role was frequently filled by the [[upholsterer]] (sometimes called the [[upholder]]), while in Paris the [[marchand-mercier]] (a "merchant of goods" who acted as general contractor) often filled this role.  [[Architects]] both in Britain and on the continent also often served as interior decorators. [[Robert Adam]], the [[neoclassical]] architect, is perhaps the most well-know late-century example of an architect who took on entire interiors, down to the doorknobs and fire-irons. Other 18th-century men who filled the role of interior decorator include: Sir [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chambers]], [[James Wyatt]], [[Dominique Daguerre]] (marchand-mercier who emigrated to England), <br/>+<br/>+In the 1830s, interior decorators were responsible for the revival of interest in Gothic and Rococo styles in England. By the later 19th century, some firms set themselves apart as "art furnishers".<br/>+<br/>+Modern interior decorators began with Lenygon and Morant in London, [[Charles Alavoine]] and Jeanselme in Paris, and [[Herter Brothers]] (from 1864) and [[Elsie De Wolfe]] and [[Ogden Codman]] in New York.<br/>+<br/>+Other early interior decorators:<br/>+*[[Gwendoline Maud Syrie Barnardo|Syrie Maugham]]<br/>+*[[Sibyl Colefax & John Fowler|Sybil Colefax]]<br/>+<br/>+Although most professional interior designers of today attend accredited interior design schools and pass nationally recognized competency examinations, many of the most famous designers and decorators during the 20th Century had no formal training: [[Sister Parish]], [[Mark Hampton]], [[Robert Denning]] & [[Vincent Fourcade]], [[Stephen Chase]], [[Mario Buatta]], [[John Saladino]], and many others were trend-setting innovators in the worlds of design and decoration.<br/>+<br/>+== Room theme ==<br/>+A theme is a consistent idea used throughout a room to create a feeling of completeness. These themes often follow period styles. Examples of this are [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] or [[Art Deco]].<br/>+The evolution of interior design themes has now grown to include themes not necessarily consistent with a specific period style allowing the mixing of pieces from different periods. Each element should contribute to form or function or both and maintain a consistent standard of quality and combine to create the desired design.<br/>+<br/>+== Education ==<br/>+Many four year, baccalaureate degrees in Interior Design exist in the United States, within major universities such as Arizona State University, UCLA, Northern Illinois University, University of Cinncinati, and Columbia University. Although masters degrees in Interior Design are less common, they are none the less available at Arizona State University and The University of Washington, among others. Many professionals pursue advanced degrees in related subjects such as industrial design, fine art or education. An undergraduate degree is a requirement for becoming an Interior Design professional and a masters degree is recommended.<br/>+ <br/>+Most Interior Design schools retain the name, Interior Design, while some schools have adopted the name interior architecture. The term interior architecture has not achieved meaning in the United States. <br/>+<br/>+In Europe, the educational requirements differ between interior architects (considered a profession comparable to <br/>+architects or structural engineers) or interior designers (considered a trade comparable to carpenters).<br/>+<br/>+Traditionally in Germany, interior architecture has been taught at polytechnical universities or universities of applied sciences.  Baccalaureate programmes are normally three years (6 semesters) in length.  The adaptation of the university system to the international degrees Bachelor and Master has led to a restructuring of degree programmes.  Since university education has traditionally lasted at least 5 years, many Diploma programmes have been transformed into consecutive graduate Master programmes.  The [[IMIAD]] programme is the first international Masters in Interior Architectural Design in cooperation with 5 European Universities.<br/>+<br/>+== On television==<br/>+In the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and elsewhere, interior decoration has become a popular [[television]] subject, with programs such as [[Changing Rooms]] ([[BBC]]) and [[Selling Houses]] ([[Channel 4]]). Famous interior designers include [[Linda Barker]] and [[Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen]].  <br/>+<br/>+In the [[United States]] the [[TLC Network]] airs a popular program called [[Trading Spaces]] which has a format similar to the UK program ''Changing Rooms'' mentioned above.  The [[Home & Garden Television]] and [[Discovery Home]] networks also both show many programs on interior design.<br/>+<br/>+==See also==<br/>+* [[Interior Design]]<br/>+* [[Feng shui]]<br/>+<br/>+[[Category:Interior design]]<br/>+<br/>+[[ru:Интерьер]]</td>

While some actors aspire to  leading man  or leading lady status, many notable actors have had enduring careers in less prominent, but important and memorable character parts.

According to the [[2005]] [[census]], the city has a population of 2,225 inhabitants.<br/> <br/>-Typically, character actors lack some of the stereotypical physical attributes associated with [[movie star|stars]]. Many older actors and actresses find their access to lead roles [[ageism|limited by age]]. Similarly, actors from marginalized or minority groups such as those belonging to minority racial groups, women, [[transsexual]]s were often barred from roles for which they were otherwise suited; some found work performing [[stereotypes]]. A character actor is usually playing a character who doesn't go through a major change in the course of the movie. They tend to help the leading character acquire the major change that always occurs to him/her.  Foreign actors may be famous in their own countries but find themselves limited in the United States under the strict unofficial guidelines of [[Hollywood]] casting; [[Marcel Dalio]], [[Cantinflas]] and [[Jet Li]] illustrate this.  Some character actors have distinctive voices or accents which in the opinion of casting directors limit their suitability for most leading roles; actors such as [[James Earl Jones]], [[Selma Diamond]] and [[Julie Kavner]] have been able to turn this to their advantage, often in [[voice-over]] work. Sometimes character actors have developed careers because they had specific talents that are required in genre films, such as dancing, horsemanship or swimming ability. Many up-and-coming actors simply find themselves [[typecasting (acting)|typecast]] in character roles due to an early success with a particular part or in a certain genre like the late [[J.T. Walsh]], who crafted a career of playing villainous characters.<br/>+Traditional agricultural activities such as sheep farming and cork tree plantation and handmade products, for example weaven lambwool cloth and furnitures were the main economy of the town. Due to the location of Grazalema right in the middle of [[Sierra de Grazalema]] nature park, these activities are now very limited and under-resourced.<br/> <br/>-See [[stock character]] and ''[[commedia dell'arte]]'' for a discussion of theatrical traditions.  <br/>+Currently the mountaineous area around Grazalema is a hotspot for climbers and hikers alike. Therefore, tourism plays a major role in sustaining the tiny township and its people.<br/> <br/>-Some character actors play essentially the same character over and over, as with [[Andy Devine]]'s humorous but resourceful sidekick or [[Dennis Farina]]'s tough cop / gangster, while other actors, such as [[Laurence Olivier]], have the capacity of submerging themselves in any role they play.<br/>+Grazalema is also one of the [[White Towns of Andalusia]].

It's just that, whereas I do agree with your analysis, that we shouldn't nominate anything for deletion purely because we don't like it, I think this rule is true for everything, and not just webcomics.  For example, I don't think anyone would ever nominate artists like the [[Chapman Brothers]], even though, they are in my opinion, the biggest waste of space ever.  Whereas my line, about judging a webcomic by its length I feel is more relevent because originally with [[WP:COMIC]] this had been pretty much the only deciding factor. - [[User:Hahnchen|Hahnchen]] 14:57, 8 December 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+== Wikipedia:Notability (websites) ==<br/>+<br/>+Hi, I've rewritten [[Wikipedia:Notability (websites)]], leaning heavily on [[Wikipedia:Notability (companies and corporations)]] for insiration.

I am afraid I placed the {{tl|afdnewbies}} template on the discussion after seeing your statement asking people to come "vote". AfD is a discussion in search of consensus, not a vote, and votestacking requests can often be viewed askance, and actually damage the article's chances of survival... You may want to remove that, or qualify it with a statement that new users may not have their words weighted as heavily.  That said, I did comment keep and hope that the AfD fails. Some references, outside of the comic itself, establishing notability would help greatly, I think. You can reply here, I watch threads I start.

I'll edit the post to make that more clear. Thanks!

At no time did I suggest that your article be relisted, let alone "insist" upon it. You've also written that you view "this request [the one that I never made] as having been made in bad faith." Are you aware that your statement that you believe I'm acting in bad faith pretty clearly shows that you are violating the official policy of [[Wikipedia:Assume good faith]]? You also make reference to "her lack of civility." What was it that I said that you thought was uncivil? Simply pointing out that you've created a vanity article is not incivility. You may want to go correct your erroneous statements about my insistance on a relist, your assumption of bad faith, and your claim that I've acted with incivility. -- [[User:Dragonfiend|Dragonfiend]] 21:52, 25 June 2006 (UTC)<br/>+** My assumption of bad faith with you is based on your past behavior, which has led me to conclude that you have some kind of personal vendetta against me and my contributions to Wiki. For example, marking the OO article as vanity when such a tag is a) redundant and b) does not have editorial concensus per the talk page. I also notice that while you've used the berifiability argument with other articles, this is the only one where you've gone and asked for a relisting because of it, giving evidence that such a request is not something you normally do, but quite likely a personal attack. To me, this shows you don't care what other editors think, you're going to do anything possible to delete a given article even if others disagree with you. That's why I now think of your edits as being in bad faith. (Note that I always assume good faith until given reason to think otherwise, which you have done.)<br/>+** I do not object to your use of the word "vanity" (if you think it's vanity, go ahead and use that word). However, I object to how you have used it: repeating it over and over again in the same sentence as you have done is a clear sign of disrespect and hostility. For example, if I thought an article is poorly written and said, "this poorly written article is so poorly written that it should be deleted for being poorly written," that is a clear sign that there is more than a simple opinion that the article is poorly written: it indicates a personal dislike/hatred of the article that, in turn, means bad faith is at work. If you don't intend to come across this way (I know Snowspinner had a similar problem with the tone of your writing), then I'm sorry. But you need to think harder about how you write your posts, because right now you are coming across very uncivilly. I had a similar issue with Brenneman, but was able to resolve it with him. You, however, have acted in a far more bellicose manner. [[User:Xuanwu|Xuanwu]] 22:10, 25 June 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+==RE: [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Okashina Okashi]]==<br/>+Firstly, I need to point out that Dragonfiend did not insist on a relist. He only asked me why I closed it as "no consensus" and raised the issue of verifiability. I duly reviewed the discussion again, and I felt, in hindsight, that the issue of verifiability had not been discussed fully and that a relist was appropriate. Since the relist there have been five more comments, so I feel that this discussion has further to run and that closing it now would not be the correct course of action. Thanks [[User:TigerShark|TigerShark]] 22:05, 25 June 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+== [[Habbo Hotel]] and [[4chan]] ==<br/>+<br/>+I can understand that you feel that the raids /b/tards make on the various Habbo Hotels is important, but that information has been discussed on each of the talk pages on the two articles, and the editors have decided that they should not be mentioned for reasons on what [[WP:NOT|Wikipedia is not]]. There is no way to give [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] on the Habbo Raids, and they have been felt to basically be self-promotion issues, that and the information is essentially a vandalism magnet (despite protection issues). [[User:Ryulong|Ryūlóng]] 21:53, 1 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+:The problem does not exist in the verifiability problem, perse, but more of the fact that such raids don't really need to be mentioned in a serious encyclopedia that Wikipedia is striving to be. There have been long discussions about whether or not to include them in [[Talk:4chan]] and [[Talk:Habbo Hotel]] and both discussions have unequivocally stated that such information is not for Wikipedia, despite the wishes of /b/tards everywhere. [[User:Ryulong|Ryūlóng]] 03:52, 2 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+::Except I'm not a /b/tard (though I do visit /a/ every now and then to see what people are watching). My understanding is that when a lot of people get together and do something on such a large scale as the Habbo raids (and even go so far as to make artwork and a soundtrack for it), this is something notable, the same way GNAA's attacks on websites is considered notable. Is the discussion still open for comment? I'd say it probably isn't as notable for Habbo Hotel as it is for 4chan, since it's a 4chan orchestrated event. I put it in both since it affected both. But 4chan should mention it somewhere, at least as an example of notable acts its members have done. [[User:Xuanwu|Xuanwu]] 03:58, 2 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+:::I wasn't saying that you were a /b/tard, it's just that information like that has been posted by /b/tards (as well as /b/radio, which was removed as well). I would think that the mention of "invasions of other online communities" is sufficient, as any sort of invasion (even the ones on Habbo) are hard to document with [[WP:RS|reliable sources]], even if there are [[Google video]] and screenshot documentations. [[User:Ryulong|Ryūlóng]] 04:32, 2 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+::::I suppose you're right. If a news outlet were to cover the raids, would that documentation issue change? [[User:Xuanwu|Xuanwu]] 21:31, 2 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+Isn't /b/tard an insult?  This raid is more like [[limecat]] and belongs on Encyclopedia Dramatica.

[[User:Anomo|Anomo]] 06:15, 2 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+:/b/tard is sort of like the song "Yankee Doodle Dandy:" it started as an insult and was then adopted by the intended targets and turned into something more neutral or even fraternal in nature.

They have borrowed and helped to evolve a sound pioneered by the likes of [[Neurosis (band)|Neurosis]] and [[Godflesh]], with music consisting of lengthy songs that focus heavily on repetition. Because of this and the fact that they tend to bury the vocals, the band use their music as a vehicle for emotion, and are not concerned with gaining mainstream attention. <br/>+{{essay|WP:META}}<br/> <br/>-==Biography==<br/>-Several sessions of experimentation in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] led friends Aaron Turner ([[guitar]]/[[vocals]]), Jeff Caxide ([[bass guitar]]), Chris Mereschuk (electronics/vocals) and Aaron Harris ([[Drum kit|drums]]) to form Isis in 1997 (see [[1997 in music]]). Isis released a demo and their first [[extended play|EP]], ''[[Mosquito Control]]'', with this lineup. After an East Coast tour in the summer of 1998 (see [[1998 in music]]) where they were joined by Randy Larsen of Cable on guitar, Mereschuk left the band to pursue other opportunities. Jay Randall ([[Agoraphobic Nosebleed]]) soon joined the band, helping release the [[Red Sea (album)|''Red Sea'']] (1999), but his stay would not last. Ultimately, this led to the addition of former Cast Iron Hike guitarist Mike Gallagher and Cliff Meyer (electronics/guitar) in 1999 (see [[1999 in music]]). After releasing debut full-length [[Celestial (album)|''Celestial'']] (2000), Isis would gain national attention in the underground [[Metal music|metal]]/[[Hardcore punk|hardcore]] scene through tours with legendary space rockers [[Cave In]] and noisecore pioneers [[Neurosis (band)|Neurosis]]. Isis remains with this lineup to date.<br/>+[[Image:Granular cell tumor (3) skin.jpg|300px|right]]<br/> <br/>-Aaron Turner is also the owner of [[Hydra Head|Hydra Head Records]] and its subsidiaries, HH Noise Industries and Tortuga Recordings.<br/>+A man noticed a bump on his nose and went to the doctor. <br/> <br/>-Where [[Celestial (album)|''Celestial'']] was still deeply rooted in [[Metal music|metal]] and [[Hardcore punk|hardcore]], the [[2002]] follow-up, [[Oceanic (album)|''Oceanic'']], saw the band acquire new characteristics comparable to [[post-rock]] and [[ambient]] music, effectively birthing the fledgling genre of [[post-metal]]. While much of the material on the album retained the band's former "metallic" intensity, this departure saw the band appeal to a far wider audience; as a result, ''Oceanic'' may be the group's most noted album to date.<br/>+: The doctor tested the bump and said, "That's a [[cancer|cancerous]] [[tumor]]. You should have that removed." <br/> <br/>-2004 (see [[2004 in music]]) saw the release of Isis' third album [[Panopticon (album)|''Panopticon'']]. The album was a progression most had predicted of the band since ''Oceanic'', with a more advanced [[post-rock]] feel to the music both structurally and in terms of sound. Before touring the [[USA]], the band performed a free concert at the [[Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art]], a manifestation of the widespread recognition the band had acquired since the release of ''Oceanic''.<br/>+The man asked, "Is this the right time to remove the bump?" <br/> <br/>-[[August 22]], [[2006]] will see the release of a DVD entitled ''[[Clearing the Eye]]'', documenting performances over the past two years throughout the world. The band finished recording their fourth album on [[July 9]], 2006 with a tentative release date set for [[Halloween]] 2006.<br/>+: The doctor replied, "I'm not sure this is the proper place to discuss the timing of the operation." <br/> <br/>-It has also recently been announced that Isis will be the opening act for [[Tool (band)|Tool's]] late 2006 North American tour in support of their new album, "[[10,000 Days]]".<br/>+The man worried, "We'll need to have my insurance agent in on any conference about the location of the meeting." <br/> <br/>-===Genre===<br/>-Isis have been compared to the genre of [[post-rock]], which leans away from the traditional elements of choruses, verses, repetitive vocals, or fast/repetitive riffs. However, Isis have more [[hardcore music|hardcore]]/[[sludge]] origins (especially in their pre-Celestial era) and [[hardcore music|hardcore]]-oriented vocals; their music involves elements from hardcore, drone, sludge, indie, ambient and post-rock, yet none can define their sound fully. Frontman Aaron Turner, when posed the challenge of defining Isis, stated they were best described as "avant-garde, drone-oriented rock, but that doesn't completely cover the bases."<br/>+: The doctor insisted, "It would be better to refer to hospital procedure for attorneys and insurance agents." <br/> <br/>-Due to this difficulty, some fans and critics tend to label Isis as ''[[post-metal]]''. This genre is accepted to contain similar-sounding contemporaries such as [[Pelican (band)|Pelican]], [[Cult of Luna]], or [[Rosetta (band)|Rosetta]].<br/>+The man protested, "It's not appropriate for the hospital to control access to my professional team." <br/> <br/>-===Themes===<br/>-Most of Isis' releases revolve around a theme, which is expanded upon within the different tracks. While each different release has its own unique theme, many of the major releases offer themes which interconnect. For more detailed perspectives on these themes, refer to the specific entries linked below.<br/>+: The doctor stood fast.

I don't know exactly what caused the error, but I do know that having thousands of pages displaying broken markup even for ten minutes is a bad thing.

Your latest edit (17:00 UTC) to {{[[Template:Infobox Single|Infobox Single]]}} broke all articles using {{[[Template:Extra chronology|Extra chronology]]}} again. This time, it was reverted by somebody else; however the template now seems to be broken for all articles ''without'' {{[[Template:Extra chronology|Extra chronology]]}}. Please fix whatever is broken, or revert back to the latest working revision. Having broken markup – meaningless to most readers – at the top of 10,000 articles is as bad as having 10,000 vandalised articles.

Remember me?  I'm the guy who posted the logos on all the NBA seasons pages, of which you told me was not allowed due to rules against images being used as decoration.  While I understand that policy and have complied to the best of my knowledge, I do have a new question about it.  Since the World Cup is going on now, I looked at some previous World Cup articles just for fun.  However, all those pages uses flag images in the same way I used the logos on the NBA articles.  Isn't that considered "decoration" as well?  It seems kinda silly to me that wikipedia has so many restrictions on fair use images where one can use a PD imsge liberaly.  If it's just a matter of PD vs. Fair Use, than I'm sorry to say that it seems to me that Wikipedia is being too conservative.  Here's my view.  If a flag is supposed to be a symbol of a country, than a sports logo is a symbol of a team or an organization.  Moreover, templates aside, the logo should be used to identify said team or organization outside of that team/organization's main article.  I mean, the flags on the different World Cup pages showcased not only the countries, but put the individual tournament in historical context, much like what I did with all the differing NBA logos through the different seasons, because how else is one to show the extent of the evolution of the NBA on Wikipedia?  Just because we err on the side of caution, doesn't mean that we should devalue creativity altogether.  But I guess that's just me.  What do you think?

I can argue conversely and say if I hit "Random article" on the left and got that page and had never heard of the Simpsons, the article would be clearer if I saw an image of The Simpsons on the article page so I understand what kind of show it is. At the very least, you could have posted a notice on the talk page proposing a deletion on the grounds of decoration.

There are plenty of other, more clear-cut violations that could be worked on until more of a consensus is reached on sports logos, I think.  [[User:LtPowers|Powers]] 14:59, 4 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-:::Yes, but my point is that it's far from clear whether this case is actually a violation or not.  [[User:LtPowers|Powers]] 15:02, 4 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-::::They're relevant because they provide identification (the same purpose they serve on the universities' pages), allow comparison of the logos, and illustrate the team mascot and colors.  [[User:LtPowers|Powers]] 15:05, 4 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-::::Wait, so Jimbo's weighed in on whether sports team logos are relevant to their respective league articles?  Perhaps you could direct me to the prior discussion on the topic.  [[User:LtPowers|Powers]] 15:10, 4 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-:::::I'd say the logos of member teams are indeed of historical significance to an article on the league.  Plus, your cited Fair Use criterion #1 is about whether there are free equivalents available; since there obviously aren't in this case, perhaps you meant FUC #8?  [[User:LtPowers|Powers]] 15:15, 4 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-::::::That "free alternative" (the name) applies to ANY logo on Wikipedia, no matter where it's used, isn't it?  [[User:LtPowers|Powers]] 15:21, 4 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-:::::::Maybe I don't understand what you mean by "identification", then.  It seems to me most fair use logos are being used at the top of a company or organization page as identification.  Historical illustration (to show the evolution of a logo) seems to be a separate issue.  [[User:LtPowers|Powers]] 15:29, 4 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-::::::::But it seems to me that part of providing encyclopedic coverage of a league is to show the logos of member teams.  I grant it's not quite as obvious as on a team or university page, but it's not as clear cut as you seem to think, either.  [[User:LtPowers|Powers]] 15:36, 4 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-:::::::::I'm not sure what kind of argument you're looking for.  Your argument for including the logos on university pages is that they're significant aspects of the university.  I say it's the same for leagues, but you're looking for something else.  I'm not sure what.  [[User:LtPowers|Powers]] 15:40, 4 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-: "but what point are you making ''about the league'' with the logos of ''the teams''."  What point is an article about a team making with the logo of that team?  The vast majority of them aren't making any point; the logo is there to provide a visual identification of the team.  It's no different on a league page, as far as I can tell.  [[User:LtPowers|Powers]] 15:47, 4 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-:: "especially when it comes to unfree media, usages of which need to be minimised."  Ah, but what does "minimized" mean?  Obviously, given current Wikipedia usage, it means "as little as possible without compromising the integrity of the encyclopedia", or something along those lines.  There must be some caveat on "minimized" or else we wouldn't have any fair use images at all.  The question is how far that caveat extends.  ''That's'' what we need to define, by consensus.

Contrary to what you may think about us sports editors, I'm 100% fully aware about what Wikipedia stands for and what the grand picture of this website is.  However, I also believe that we cannot rule this entire website on the basis of guidelines if there is a large amount of confusion on some of the policies, like fair use for example.  What may be black and white to you and a few others is not so to the rest of the editors here, and that is something that you should recognize.<br/>-Also, you must know that ALL of my edits on wikipedia was made to make wikipedia better as an encyclopedia, and not to make it look like ESPN or Sports Illustrated.  The inclusion of the NBA logos were an encyclopedic tool to be used to help track the course of a team through NBA History.  The current logos on the main NBA page were a tool to help visually identify a team, since there are no other alternatives to logos anyway.  This isn't "Man, Wikipedia looks boring.  Let's spruce things up a little!" as it seems like you are putting it.  To me, this whole issue ISN'T about logos.  I mean I would personally prefer them on, but that isn't the issue here.  This is about Wikipedia as a whole, and how not listning to new ideas simply because "It violates wiki-policy" will not only harm wikipedia's potential for growth, bit will deter new users and potential editors from participating on what is otherwise a fantastic project.  <br/>-Considering the fact that you are indeed an administrator, your actions and your (now apparant) biases concerning Wikipedia's editors, myself included, is sad indeed.  You make it sound like sports editors are out to ruin Wikipedia, when that isn't the case at all.  My intentions were to make Wikipedia the best web resource available and all of my edits were in accordance to my interpretation to Wikipedia's policy, always have been and always will be.  But if you think that I am too misguided to edit here, then maybe I shouldn't edit here at all.  But I believe in Wikipedia so much to let it end like this.

I was talking about the discusion to change the fair use policy, or any other policy issues for that matter, itself.  Moreover, we SHOULD care about how other editors feel, because those editors bring in new ideas and information that helps Wikipedia grow every day.  Not caring if individual editors leaving for one reason or another is not the right way to be an administrator.  I would try to work with every user if they had a problem, and be open to any possible ideas they have about Wikipedia's policy if they have issues.  You chose to stick to the policy, despite the fact that so many editors have an issue about Fair Use, not just logos, but the whole concept.  Wikipedia is more than a "free content" encyclopedia.  It is a community of editors who all have ideas on how to improve Wikipedia.  Those attempts do not deserve to be shot down and thrown out the wayside just because the policies are supposidly final.  You may say I'm in the wrong, but IMHO, you are in the wrong with the way you've chosen to approach this issue, I'm sorry to say.

Although he served as a federal judge for a record 61 years (45 active, 16 senior), others have performed judicial work at greater ages or for longer periods. He was born in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]] and resided in [[Nebraska]] from 1897. He was appointed a judge of the United States District Court for Nebraska by President [[Woodrow Wilson]] in 1916 and promoted to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit]] by President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1933. He took senior status in January 1961, and performed no judicial functions after taking part in a courthouse dedication later that year. However, he remained a salaried Senior Circuit Judge until his death in 1977. He was the grandson of Joseph Woodrough and Agnes Moreman.  The grandfather was a saw maker in Cambridge Massachusetts.  Woodrough saws are highly collectable items.

The Springboks (or Springbokke in Afrikaans), as they are commonly referred to, compete in the [[Tri Nations Series|Tri Nations]] alongside the New Zealand [[All Blacks]] and [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]], as well as competitions such as the [[Rugby World Cup]]. Although they did not compete in the first two World Cups in the late 1980s and early 1990s due to sports boycotts of South Africa, they did make their debut in the [[1995 Rugby World Cup|1995 World Cup]], hosting it as well. They defeated the All Blacks in the final, which is now remembered as one of the greatest moments in South Africa's sporting history.<br/>+<br/>+The Springboks play in green and gold jerseys and have been playing international rugby since 1891, when a [[British and Irish Lions|British Isles]] side toured the nation, playing South Africa in their first test on July 30. Today the Springboks are regarded as one of the best rugby nations in the world. The current head coach is [[Jake White]], and the captain, [[John Smit]].<br/>+<br/>+==Strip==<br/>+[[Image:SAF-Rugby-jersey-2002.jpg|thumb|right|An older strip.

Currently, their strip is made by [[Canterbury of New Zealand]] and their shirt sponsor is South African synfuels and chemicals company [[Sasol]].<br/>+<br/>+The jersey has traditionally always had a gold collar. White shorts and green socks with two gold hoops, with the Canterbury logo in gold, make up the kit. The [[flag of South Africa]] can be seen on the sleeve. The Springboks also have an alternate jersey which is white to avoid kit clashes, which is not commonly used.<br/>+<br/>+The SA Rugby logo is on the left upper right corner of the front of the jersey. When Australia first toured South Africa in 1933, the visitors wore sky blue jerseys to avoid confusion, as at the time, both wore dark green strips. In 1953, when the Wallabies toured again, the Springboks wore white jerseys for the test matches.<ref name=strip>{{cite web | publisher=[[Australian Rugby Union]] | title=History of the ARU|url=http://rugby.com.au/about_the_aru/history_of_the_aru/history_of_the_aru,183.html| accessdate=6 August| accessyear=2006}}</ref><br/>+<br/>+==History==<br/>+===Early years===<br/>+When Canon George Ogilvie became headmaster of [[Diocesan College]] in <br/>+[[Cape Town]] in 1861, he introduced the game of football, as played at [[Winchester School]]. This version of football, which included handling, is seen as the beginnings of rugby in South Africa.<br/>+<br/>+The first match in South Africa took place between the "Officers of the Army" and the "Gentlemen of the Civil Service" at Green Point in Cape Town in 1862 and ended as a 0-0 draw. The first governing body of the sport - England’s [[Rugby Football Union]] (RFU) - was founded in 1871 and thereafter Rugby’s rules held sway.<br/>+<br/>+British colonists helped spread the game through the Eastern Cape, Natal and along the gold and diamond routes to Kimberley and Johannesburg. British troops would also play a key role in spreading the game throughout the country. Various clubs were formed but Hamilton RFC in [[Cape Town]] probably has the strongest claim at being the first, though this is disputed by Villagers RFC. In 1883 the game was strong enough in the Western Cape for the Western Province Rugby Football Union to be formed; Griqualand West followed in 1886; Eastern Province in 1888 and in 1889 the South African Rugby Football Union was founded. <br/>+<br/>+The first ever [[British and Irish Lions|British Lions]] tour took place in 1891 with the trip financially underwritten by [[Cecil Rhodes]] and President Kruger of the [[Transvaal Republic]]. These were the first representative games played by South African sides, who were still learning the game. The tourists played and won a total of twenty matches, conceding only one try in the process. Three games were played against regional sides were considered tests (South Africa did not exist as a political unit in 1891). In a notable event of the tour, the British side presented the [[Currie Cup]] to [[Griqualand West]], the province they thought produced the best performance on the tour.<br/>+<br/>+The Lions' success continued in 1896, they played one extra match on this tour, to make a total of 21 games. The Lions won three out of the four tests against South Africa with three games won out of the four played. The improvement in South African play from 1891 was marked, particularly in their impressive forwards, and their first test win in the final game was a pointer to the future. For the first time South Africa had worn myrtle green shirts, borrowed by captain, Barry Heatlie, from his Old Diocesian club. Rugby was given a huge boost by the early Lions tours which created great interest in the South African press. <br/>+<br/>+Rugby was well suited to the lifestyle of the [[Afrikaner]]s and it became so popular that in 1902 there was a temporary ceasefire in the [[Second Boer War]] so that a rugby game could be played between British and Boer forces. The game had spread amongst the Afrikaner population through [[POW]] games in the Boer War, and afterwards [[Stellenbosch University]] became a training camp for future players and rugby leaders. <br/>+<br/>+In 1903 the Lions lost a series for the first time in South Africa, drawing the opening two tests before losing the last 8-0. In all they won just 11 of their 22 tour games. In contrast South Africa would not lose another series - home or away - until 1956. In the final test South Africa wore the green Old Diocesan shirts that had brought them luck in their 1896 win. The jersey was thereafter adopted as the official team kit.<br/>+<br/>+===Springboks===<br/>+[[Image:1906 Springboks.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The 1906 Springboks team.]]<br/>+[[Paul Roos (rugby player)|Paul Roos]] was the captain of the first Springbok team. The first tour of Britain took place in 1906/7 and took in 29 matches. England managed to draw with them, but Scotland was the only one of the home unions to gain a victory. It was during this tour that the nickname, Springboks, was first used. At an impromtu meeting, the tour manager, officials and Paul Roos invented the nickname 'Springbok' to prevent the British press from inventing their own nickname.<br/>+<br/>+Roos told to the newspaper reporters that they were to call the team 'De Springbokken', the Daily Mail then printed an article referring to the 'Springboks'. The team thereafter wore blazers with a springbok on the left breast pocket. The trip helped heal wounds after the Boer War and instilled a sense of national pride in the South Africans.  <br/>+<br/>+The South Africans crossed the channel to play an unofficial match against a 'France' team drawn from the two Parisian clubs: Stade Français and Racing Club de France. The official France team were in England at the time. The Springboks scored 13 tries in winning 55-6. The 1910 Lions tour of South Africa was the first to included representatives of all four home unions.<br/>+<br/>+The team performed moderately against the non-test parties, claiming victories in just over half their matches. The tourists won just one of their three tests. The Boks second European tour took place in 1912/13. They beat the four [[Home nation]]s to earn their first [[Grand Slam (Rugby Union)|Grand Slam]] and also went on to defeat France. The side toured Britain in 1906 that they became known as the Springboks.<br/>+<br/>+===Inter war===<br/>+The 1924 Lions were ravaged by injuries and let down by poor kicking. The sorry tour record left them with only nine wins from 21 games, including defeat in all four tests (a game against the Western Province had test status). Despite this it was agreed that it had been a fantastic test series with some thrilling rugby. The Springboks and the All Blacks started a famous rivalry in 1921, the Springboks' tour of New Zealand was tense and competitive, the test series finishing all square. The All Blacks first toured South Africa in 1928, the test series again finishing level. In 1937, South Africa broke the deadlock with a series win in New Zealand (and also Australia), and it was not until 1996, under Sean Fitzpatrick's captaincy, that New Zealand finally won its first series in the Republic.<br/>+<br/>+The Springbok tourists of 1931-2 were an unloved team. They had a jumbo pack and a kicking fly-half in captain Benny Osler. They steamrollered the opposition, winning their second Grand Slam. A strong Welsh side were beaten 8-3 at St Helen's with [[Danie Craven]] enjoying a superb debut at scrum-half. The Lions toured South Africa again in 1938, winning more than half of their normal matches. The first two tests were easily claimed by the Springboks, but the tourists recorded a surprise win in the third and last. It was the first Lions win in South Africa since 1910.<br/>+<br/>+===Post War Era===<br/>+[[Danie Craven]] was appointed coach in 1949. He started his coaching career with a bang, winning 10 matches in a row, including a 4-0 whitewash of New Zealand in their 1949 tour to South Africa. The team that many consider to be the finest Springbok side to tour swept the board in 1951/52 winning the Grand Slam whilst playing exciting rugby. [[Hennie Muller]] took over the captaincy after Basil Kenyon suffered a serious eye injury. They also beat France as they won 30 of 31 matches on tour. <br/>+<br/>+The [[1955]] Lions tour to [[South Africa]] won 19 and drew 1 from the 25 fixtures. The four-test series ended in a drawn series. In 1956 under the captaincy of Bob Duff and through the surprise selection of Waikato player Don Clarke (nicknamed 'the Boot') who kicked the decisive penalties in the final games, New Zealand won its first ever series over the Springboks.<br/>+<br/>+The last Springbok Grand Slam came in 1960/61 when Avril Malan's side beat all four Home unions on a four-month, 34-game sweep through Europe. This was the last time the Boks managed the feat, failing in 1969/70, 1998, and 2004. They were a reactionary side, reflecting a nation still in shock from their 1956 series defeat in New Zealand. They played a ruthless, forward-oriented game; intimidation was a key part of their game, with opposition players suffering a string of controversial injuries. The Boks, however, lost their final game 6-0 against the Barbarians in Cardiff, when perhaps the best Barbarians' pack ever played an uncharacteristically pragmatic game. <br/>+<br/>+The 1962 tour to South Africa saw the Lions win 16 of their 25 games, but did not fair well in the tests losing all three. A protest movement against the 1960 New Zealand tour of South Africa was unsuccessful at stopping the tour but the [[New Zealand Rugby Union]] decided to cancel the proposed 1967 tour when the South African government refused to allow Maori players to play in the All Black team. Following this cancellation, the South African government agreed to treat Maoris in the team and Maori spectators as "honorary whites".<br/>+<br/>+The 1968 Lions tour of South Africa saw the Lions win 15 of their 16 provincinal matches, but the team actually lost three tests against the Springboks and drew one. A South African rugby tour of Britain and Ireland in 1969 was greeted with large demonstrations wherever they went and matches had to be played behind barbed wire fences. A new spirit and confidence had developed in Home nations rugby and the tourists lost two of their seven games in Wales, against Newport and a composite side from Gwent. Wales nearly claimed their first win against the Springboks; the game ended 6-6. <br/>+<br/>+In June-July 1970 the All Blacks toured South Africa, the Springboks won the test series 3-1.<br/>+The 1973 Springbok tour of New Zealand was cancelled by the Prime Minister of New Zealand. However the 1976 All-Blacks tour of South Africa went ahead and again the Springboks won by three tests to one. Massive anti-apartheid demonstrations greeted the [[1971 Springbok tour|South African rugby tour of Australia in 1971]]. The South African team had to be transported in Australian Air Force planes as the trade unions refused to service planes or trains transporting them. The Springboks’ tour began with matches in Perth, then Adelaide and Melbourne; the Springboks who won all three tests; 18-6, 14-6 and 19-11.<br/>+<br/>+The Lions team toured South Africa in [[1974]] and went through 22 games unbeaten, and triumphed 3-0 (with one drawn) in the test series. The management of the Lions concluded that the Springboks dominated their opponents with physical aggression. The Lions decided "to get their retaliation in first" with the infamous '99 call'. The idea was that a South African referee would be unlikely to send off all of the Lions if they all retaliated against "blatant thuggery". At the battle of [[EPRFU Stadium|Boet Erasmus Stadium]], one of the most violent in rugby history, there is famous video footage of [[JPR Williams]] running over half of the pitch and launching himself at van Heerden after such a call.<br/>+<br/>+After public opposition and international representations, the French Government stopped the 1979 South African tour of France and announced that it was inappropriate for South African teams to tour France. It also stopped a French tour of South Africa in 1983. In the United States, a South African tour in 1981 was greeted by mass demonstrations, which put an end to similar tours.<br/>+<br/>+The Lions toured South Africa in 1980. The team completed a flawless non-test record, winning 14 out of 14 non-test matches on the tour. The Lions did however lose the first three tests to winning the last one, though the series had already been won by the Springboks. In 1977 the Commonwealth signed a document called the [[Gleneagles Agreement]], which had the aim of discouraging sporting contact with South Africa, despite this the infamous [[1981]] [[1981 Springbok Tour|tour of New Zealand]] went ahead. South Africa lost the series 2-1, but the implications of the tour went far beyond rugby. As an indirect result of this tour, South Africa was banned by the [[International Rugby Board]] from international competition until the end of apartheid. South Africa sought to counteract its sporting isolation by inviting the [[South American Jaguars]] to tour there which lead to eight matches being played between the two teams inthe early 1980s. In 1985, a planned All Black tour of South Africa was stopped by the [[New Zealand High Court]]. An unofficial tour did take place in 1986 by a team including some but not the majority of All Blacks players. These were known outside South Africa as 'the Cavaliers', but advertised inside the Republic as the All Blacks.<br/>+<br/>+===The 1990s===<br/>+[[Image:Springboks.JPG|thumb|250px|right|The SA Rugby 'Springbok' logo.]]<br/>+Until the [[1990]]s the Springboks had a positive win record against every nation they played. After the Springboks were readmitted to international rugby in 1992, following the demise of apartheid, they initially struggled to return to their previous high standards. Their first game back was a 27-24 defeat by New Zealand on the 15th of August 1992. The newly elected [[ANC]] government suggested that the Springbok nickname and emblem should be replaced with 'Proteas' after the national flower of South Africa. For many South Africans the springbok had come to symbolise apartheid; special dispensation was given to carry on using the springbok emblem after the intervention by [[Nelson Mandela]], the first black president of South Africa, ahead of the 1995 Rugby World Cup.<br/>+<br/>+There was a remarkable surge of support for the Springboks amongst the white and black communities in the lead-up to the [[1995 Rugby World Cup]]. This was the first major event to be held in the Rainbow Nation, and the nation got behind the 'one team, one country' slogan; however the squad included only one “coloured” player, [[Chester Williams]]. By the time they hosted the [[1995 Rugby World Cup|1995 World Cup]], the Springboks were seeded ninth.   They went on to <br/>+defeat Australia, [[Romania national rugby union team|Romania]], [[Canada national rugby union team|Canada]], [[Samoa national rugby union team|Western Samoa]] and [[France national rugby union team|France]] to play in the final. South Africa won the epic final against a debilitated New Zealand 15-12 at [[Ellis Park Stadium]] with a [[drop goal]] from [[Joel Stransky]] securing victory in extra-time. The New Zealanders were struck down by a virulent food poisoning the day before the fixture and suspicions that this had been done deliberately by the South African rugby authorities continue to this day.<ref name=ob>{{cite web | publisher=[[The Observer]] | title=OSM's sporting plaque|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,,1251765,00.html| accessdate=6 August | accessyear=2006}}</ref> <ref name=rh>{{cite web | publisher=[[Rugby Heaven]] | title=Suzie never existed|url=http://www.rugbyheaven.smh.com.au/articles/2003/08/11/1060588317125.html| accessdate=6 August| accessyear=2006}}</ref> <br/>+<br/>+Nelson Mandela wearing a Springbok shirt presented the trophy to captain [[Francois Pienaar]], an Afrikaner. This was widely seen as a major step in the reconciliation of white and black South Africans. SARFU President Louis Luyt caused controversy at the post-match dinner by declaring that the Springboks would have won the previous two World Cups if they had been allowed to compete. The day after the World Cup victory, the [[Xhosa]] word for Springbok, "Amabokoboko!" appeared as the headline of the Sowetan newspaper sports page. <br/>+<br/>+A series of crises followed in the period 1995-7 as it became clear that South African rugby was an unreformed element of the new Rainbow Nation. Allied to this was an on-field slump that saw South African sides struggle in the new [[Super 14|Super 12]] and Tri Nations competitions, and against the 1997 Lions who completed the tour only losing two games in total. The Lions won the test series two games to one. <br/>+<br/>+Coach [[Andre Markgraaff]] was sacked in 1997 and replaced by [[Nick Mallett]]. In 1998 under new captain Gary Teichmann they went on a record winning streak, winning 17 consecutive tests, including the 1998 [[Tri Nations Series]], before an exhausted team lost to England at the end of a long tour. The Springboks entered the 1999 Rugby World Cup with little hope. Reverting to a kicking game and forward strength, they showed they were still a force to be reckoned with and they only went out to eventual champions Australia after a tense semi-final at Twickenham.<br/>+<br/>+===The new millennium===<br/>+The November [[2002]] test against [[England national rugby union team|England]] at [[Twickenham Stadium|Twickenham]] saw England hand the Boks the worst defeat in their history (53-3). During the match, an increasingly frustrated South Africa side began targeting England players with physical attacks, and match footage apparently showed captain Krige as a leader.<ref name=krige>{{cite web | publisher=[[BBC Sport]] | title=Krige in the spotlight|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/international/2525929.stm| accessdate=6 August| accessyear=2006}}</ref> In the 2002/3 season, they also lost by record margins to [[France national rugby union team|France]], [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] and [[All Blacks|New Zealand]], defeating [[Argentina national rugby union team|Argentina]] by only one point, and being easily dispatched in the quarter finals of the [[2003 Rugby World Cup|2003 World Cup]].<br/>+<br/>+The buildup to the Boks' 2003 World Cup campaign was tumultuous. During a pre-World Cup training camp, there was a highly publicized dispute between Geo Cronjé (an Afrikaner) and Quinton Davids (a coloured). Both were dropped from the team, and Cronjé was called before a tribunal to answer charges that his actions in the dispute were racially motivated (Cronjé was eventually cleared). Later, the Boks were sent to a military-style boot camp in the South African bush called [[Kamp Staaldraad]] (literal English translation "Camp Steel-wire", idiomatically "Camp Barbed Wire"). When details of the events at Kamp Staaldraad leaked, most South African rugby supporters reacted in outrage.<br/>+<br/>+After the World Cup debacle, Boks coach [[Rudolph Straeuli]] was under fire, not only because of the team's poor results, but because of his role in organizing Kamp Staaldraad. He eventually resigned, and in February 2004, [[Jake White]] was named as the Boks' new coach. He had previously coached the Springboks under-21 side, which won the inaugural U21 Rugby World Cup in [[2002]] under his direction.<br/>+<br/>+The Boks then proceeded to prove to the rugby world that they were ready to return to past greatness, starting with a sweep of [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]] in a two-Test series and a win over [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] during their opponents' June 2004 tours of the Southern Hemisphere. Next came a pulsating win in [[2004 Tri Nations Series|the most closely-contested Tri Nations Series in history]]. In November 2004, they went on an ambitious "[[Grand Slam (Rugby Union)|Grand Slam]]" tour of the [[Home Nations]]. The Boks lost decisively to [[England national rugby union team|England]], lost a controversial decision to [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]], won a hard-fought match with [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]], and won comfortably over [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]]. While the tour did not live up to the Boks' original aspirations, it nonetheless proved that the Boks had awakened from their slumber of the past few years.<br/>+<br/>+Their resurgence was honored at the end of their tour with a sweep of the major [[International Rugby Board|IRB]] awards. The Boks were named IRB World Team of the Year, White was named IRB World Coach of the Year, and young flanker [[Schalk Burger]] was named IRB World Player of the Year. 2005 started off with a bang with the Sringboks smashing an embarrassed Uruguay by a world record margin. Zimbabwean-born new cap, Tonderai Chavanga, scored a record 6 tries in the match, surpassing Stefan Terblanches previous record of 5.<br/>+The side went on to finish second in the tri-nations that year, losing their final match to New Zealand.The year ended on positive notes with close victories away from home against Argentina amongst others. With several new players in the 2006 squad, the Springboks defeated Scotland twice (at home) before losing a closely contested match to France that ended a long undefeated record at home. After a a very bad start to the [[2006 Tri Nations Series]], losing 49 to nil to the Wallabies, the Springboks put together better games in the following two matches, losing in the finals minutes in the second test against Australia.<br/>+<br/>+==Stadium==<br/>+There is no one national stadium that the Springboks use as their home, as they play out of a number of venues throughout the country. [[Ellis Park]] in [[Johannesburg]] was the main venue at  South Africa's [[1995 Rugby World Cup|1995 World Cup]], the 60,000 seater stadium hosting final, in which the Springboks defeated the All Blacks. Along with Ellis Park, other regular venues include [[Pretoria]]'s [[Loftus Versfeld]], the [[Newlands Stadium]] in [[Cape Town]], the [[ABSA Stadium]] in [[Durban]], and the [[EPRFU Stadium]] in [[Port Elizabeth]]. The first ever South African international took place at Port Elizabeth's [[Sahara Oval St George’s|cricket ground]]. Most of the stadiums used today are those owned by the provincial Rugby Unions. A notable advantage that the Springboks have over touring sides is when the games are played at [[altitude]], as it can be a problem physically, and can factor into a match in a number of other ways, such as the ball travelling further when being kicked.<ref name=altitiude>{{cite web | publisher=world.rugby.com.au | title=Wallabies Focus on Upsetting Springboks|url=http://www.world.rugby.com.au/aru_shared/news/imported_-_old_site/2002_august/wallabies_focus_on_upsetting_springboks_14472,6467.html| accessdate=6 August| accessyear=2006}}</ref><br/>+<br/>+==Current squad==<br/>+:''Teams as of [[2006 Super 14 season]] and [[2006 Currie Cup]]''<br/>+<table><br/>+<tr><br/>+<td valign=top width=50%><br/>+* [[Eddie Andrews]] -

Percentage estimates were given that 10&ndash;30% of all Aboriginal children born during the seventy year period were removed.<br/>+<br/>+Similar actions were undertaken in [[Canada]] where children were sent to [[Canadian residential school system|residential schools]]. [http://archives.cbc.ca/IDD-1-70-692/disasters_tragedies/residential_schools/]<br/>+<br/>+In recent years, however, the Stolen Generation has been labelled a myth by several conservative news pundits, who have thrown doubt on whether racism was the principal motivation behind removing children and indeed whether children were removed at all from any state except Queensland.<br/>+<br/>+==The policy in theory==<br/>+Although children of full Aboriginal descent were removed, in general "[[half-caste]]s", the children of "mixed descent" (having partial European ancestry) were the most targeted. A [[1937]] Federal Government conference on Native Welfare concluded in its final report that "...the destiny of the natives of Aboriginal origin, but not of the full blood, lies in their ultimate absorption by the people of the Commonwealth, and it therefore recommends that all efforts be directed to that end."\t<br/>+<br/>+Therefore the aim of the policy was two-fold: one was to assimilate mixed-descent Aborigines into the European society and culture. (Full-blooded Aborigines were considered too uncivilized to be assimilated.) The other was to ensure mixed-descent Aborigines would intermarry with Caucasians rather than with Aborigines; although the [[Social Darwinism|Social Darwinist]] ideology prevalent at the time held that the Aboriginal race would sooner or later die out, it was decided that the process was to be hastened by eventually breeding the Aboriginal race out of existence.<br/>+<br/>+[[A. O. Neville]], the Chief Protector of the Aborigines in [[Western Australia]], was probably the most vocal proponent of the policy at the time.<br/>+<br/>+==The policy in practice== <br/>+A recent Government report [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/special/rsjproject/rsjlibrary/hreoc/stolen/stolen18.html] noted that removals were certainly voluntary in some cases, as some mothers surrendered their children as they believed that they were unable to raise them for some reason. However a substantial body of evidence indicates that in a large number of cases children were forcibly removed from their parents using "force or duress". In general the practice was to remove children between the ages of two and four, although in some cases, children were removed just hours after birth.<br/>+<br/>+The official report observed that in many cases gross violations of human rights occurred. Children were in some cases forcibly removed from their mothers' arms while still in the hospital. Other evidence gathered indicated that deception and brutality was used to remove the children. One account referring to events in [[1935]] stated that...<br/>+:''"I was at the post office with my Mum and Auntie [and cousin]. They put us in the police [vehicle] and said they were taking us to Broome. They put the mums in there as well. But when we'd gone [about ten miles] they stopped, and threw the mothers out of the car. We jumped on our mothers' backs, crying, trying not to be left behind. But the policemen pulled us off and threw us back in the car. They pushed the mothers away and drove off, while our mothers were chasing the car, running and crying after us."'' [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/special/rsjproject/rsjlibrary/hreoc/stolen/]<br/>+<br/>+The official report closely examined the distinctions between "forcible removal", "removal under threat or duress", "official deception", "uninformed voluntary release", and "voluntary release". Even in the last case, there was evidence that in some cases Aboriginal parents voluntarily sent their children to religious missions, in the hope that at least in this way they would be able to retain contact with their children and some knowledge of their whereabouts. With regard to official deception, the report identified several cases where parents were told by government officials that their children had died, even though this was not the case.  <br/>+<br/>+The report also acknowledged that in several cases the state took responsibility for children that were genuinely orphaned or in a state of neglect.  Defenders of the removals, in fact, claim that mixed-race children were often severely neglected within Aboriginal communities.  The evidence gathered also indicated a substantial number of cases where the care of the children after removal was extremely good. Nonetheless, the report condemned the policy of disconnecting children from their "cultural heritage". In the testimony of one Aboriginal; "I've got everything that could be reasonably expected: a good home environment, education, stuff like that, but that's all material stuff. It's all the non-material stuff that I didn't have &mdash; the lineage... You know, you've just come out of nowhere; there you are". [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/special/rsjproject/rsjlibrary/hreoc/stolen/stolen04.html]<br/>+<br/>+Removed children were in most cases placed into institutional facilities operated by religious or charitable organisations, although a significant number, particularly females, were "fostered" out. A common aspect of the removals was the failure by these institutions to keep records of the actual parentage of the child, or such details as the date or place of birth. The report went on to note that "...the physical infrastructure of missions, government institutions and children's homes was often very poor and resources were insufficient to improve them or to keep the children adequately clothed, fed and sheltered." Incidence of [[sexual abuse]] were disturbingly high, overall 17% of females and 8% of males reported experiencing some form of sexual abuse while under institutional or foster care. [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/special/rsjproject/rsjlibrary/hreoc/stolen/stolen18.html]<br/>+<br/>+The social impacts of forced removal have been measured and found to be quite severe. Although the stated aim of the "resocialisation" programme was to improve the integration of Aboriginals into modern society, a study conducted in [[Melbourne, Australia|Melbourne]] and cited in the official report found that there was no tangible improvement in the social position of "removed" Aborigines as compared to "non-removed", particularly in the areas of employment and post-secondary education. Most notably, the study indicated that removed Aboriginals were actually less likely to have completed a secondary education, three times as likely to have acquired a police record and were twice as likely to use illicit drugs. The only notable advantage "removed" Aboriginals possessed was a higher average income, which the report noted was most likely due to the increased urbanisation of removed individuals, and hence greater access to welfare payments than for Aboriginals living in tribal communities.<br/>+<br/>+The legal circumstances regarding the Stolen Generation remain unclear. Although some compensation claims are pending, it is not possible for a court to rule on behalf of plaintiffs simply because they were removed, as at the time, such removals were entirely legal under [[Australian law]]. Likewise, even though the actions may have contravened International Law, ruling on such a basis is outside the jurisdiction of Australian courts. At least two compensation claims have passed through the Australian courts and failed. The presiding judge noted in his summary judgement that he was not ruling that there would never be valid cases for compensation with regard to the Stolen Generation, only that in these specific two cases he could not find evidence of illegal conduct by the officials involved.<br/>+<br/>+==History of public awareness ==<br/>+<br/>+Awareness of the Stolen Generation, and the practices which created it, only began to enter the public arena in the late [[1980s]] through the efforts of Aboriginal activists, artists and [[:Category:Indigenous_Australian_musicians|musicians]]. The extensive public interest in the [[Mabo v Queensland (No 2)|Mabo]] case had the side effect of throwing the media spotlight on all issues related to Aborigines and [[Torres Strait Islander]]s in Australia, and most notably the Stolen Generation.<br/>+<br/>+In [[1992]], as media attention and public interest began to mount, the [[Prime Minister]], [[Paul Keating]] made the first formal acknowledgement of the Stolen Generation, by saying in a speech that "... we took the children from their mothers ... It was our ignorance and prejudice." In [[1995]] the (then) Attorney-General, the Hon. [[Michael Lavarch]] MP, commissioned a formal inquiry entitled "The National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families". <br/>+<br/>+This inquiry commenced in May 1995, presided over by Sir [[Ronald Wilson]], the president of the (Australian) Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission, and [[Mick Dodson]], the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner at the [[Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission]] (HREOC). During the ensuing 17 months, the Inquiry visited every state and Territory in Australia, heard testimony from 535 Aboriginal Australians, and received submissions of evidence from over 600 more. In April [[1997]] the official report ''"Bringing Them Home - Report of the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families"'' was released.<br/>+<br/>+Between the commissioning of the National Inquiry and the release of the final report in 1997, the conservative government of [[John Howard]] had replaced the Keating government. The report proved to be a considerable embarrassment for the Howard administration, as it recommended that the Australian Government formally apologise to the affected families, a proposal actively rejected by Howard, on the grounds that a formal admission of wrongdoing would lead to massive compensation litigation. Howard was quoted as saying "Australians of this generation should not be required to accept guilt and blame for past actions and policies." [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/special/rsjproject/rsjlibrary/car/arc/speeches/opening/howard.htm]. As a result Commissioner Dodson resigned from the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, saying in a newspaper column that "I despair for my country and regret the ignorance of political leaders who do not appreciate what is required to achieve reconciliation for us as a nation." [http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/2000/12/08/FFXDTEAWFGC.html]<br/>+<br/>+As a result of the report, formal apologies were tabled and passed in the state parliaments of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[South Australia]] and [[New South Wales]], and also in the parliament of the [[Northern Territory]]. On [[26 May]] [[1998]] the first "[[National Sorry Day]]" was held, and reconciliation events were held nationally, and attended by over a million people. As public pressure continued to increase, Howard drafted a motion of "deep and sincere regret over the removal of Aboriginal children from their parents" which was passed by the federal parliament in August [[1999]]. Howard went on to say that the Stolen Generation represented "...the most blemished chapter in the history of this country." [http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/stories/s115691.htm] However, some felt that his motion stopped too short of saying "sorry", and therefore was unacceptable. <br/>+<br/>+In [[April 2000]] a scandal occurred when the (then) Aboriginal Affairs Minister, [[John Herron (Australian politician)|John Herron]], tabled a report in Parliament that questioned whether or not there ever actually had been a "Stolen Generation", on the semantic distinction that as "only 10% of Aboriginal children" has been removed, they did not constitute an entire "generation". After a week of scathing media commentary and the attempted invasion of parliament by scores of angry Indigenous Australians, Mr Herron apologised for the "understandable offence taken by some people" as a result of his comments, although he refused to alter the report as it had been tabled, and in particular the (disputed) figure of 10%.

A similar walk was staged in Melbourne later that year.<br/>+<br/>+In [[July 2000]], the issue of the Stolen Generation came before the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] in Geneva who heavily criticised the Howard government for its manner of attempting to resolve the issues related to the Stolen Generation. Australia was also the target of a formal censure by the [[UN]] Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.

See [[Constructed language]] for details on the creation of planned or artificial languages.''<br/>+<br/>+'''Language planning''' refers to deliberate efforts to influence the behaviour of others with respect to the acquisition, structure, or functional allocation of language. Typically it will involve the development of goals, objectives and strategies to change the way language is used. At a governmental level, language planning takes the form of [[language policy]]. Many nations have [[List of language regulators|language regulatory bodies]] which are specifically charged with formulating and implementing language planning policies.<br/>+<br/>+The term 'language planning' has often been identified with a third world context, being seen as a tool for the establishment of standardised national languages as a part of [[modernisation]] and [[nation building]]. In fact, language planning is neither a modern phenomenon nor is it confined to the third world.   <br/>+<br/>+Language planning can be divided into three sub-dimensions: <br/>+<br/>+* ''Corpus planning'' refers to intervention in the forms of a language. This may be achieved by creating new words or expressions, modifying old ones, or selecting among alternative forms. Corpus planning aims to develop the resources of a language so that it becomes an appropriate medium of communication for modern topics and forms of discourse, equipped with the [[terminology]] needed for use in administration, education, etc. Corpus planning is often related to the [[standard language|standardisation]] of a language, involving the preparation of a [[normative]] [[orthography]], [[grammar]], and [[dictionary]] for the guidance of writers and speakers in a speech community. Efforts at linguistic purism and the exclusion of foreign words (see [[linguistic protectionism]]) also belong to corpus planning, as do [[spelling reform]] and the introduction of new writing systems (e.g. that of the [[Turkish language]]). For a previously unwritten language, the first step in corpus planning is the development of a [[writing system]]. <br/>+<br/>+* ''Status planning'' refers to deliberate efforts to allocate the functions of languages and literacies within a speech community. It involves status choices, making a particular language or variety an '[[official language]]', '[[national language]]', etc. Often it will involve elevating a [[language]] or [[dialect]] into a [[prestige dialect|prestige variety]], which may be at the expense of competing dialects. Status planning is part and parcel of creating a new writing system since a writing system can only be developed after a suitable dialect is chosen as the standard. Status planning tends to be the most controversial aspect of language planning (see article on [[Language policy]]).<br/>+<br/>+* ''Acquisition planning'' concerns the teaching and [[language acquisition|learning of languages]], whether national languages or [[second language|second]] and [[foreign language]]s. It involves efforts to influence the number of users and the distribution of languages and literacies, achieved by creating opportunities or incentives to learn them. Such efforts may be based on policies of [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] or [[pluralism]]. Acquisition planning is directly related to language spread. While acquisition planning is normally the province of national, regional, or local governments, bodies such as the [[British Council]], [[Alliance française]], [[Instituto Cervantes]] and [[Goethe-Institut]] are also very active internationally promoting education in their respective languages.  <br/>+<br/>+Language planning is not necessarily conducted at the national level. It can also be carried out by ethnic, religious or occupational groups. One group that is responsible for considerable language planning around the world, especially for peoples with unwritten languages, is [[SIL International]] (originally the Summer Institute of Linguistics) in the U.S. Language planning can also go from the bottom up, such as the movement for [[non-sexist language]] in the U.S., which originated with grass-roots feminist groups.<br/>+<br/>+== Some books on language planning ==<br/>+* TAULI, V.

As such, programming languages differ from most other forms of human expression in that they require a greater degree of precision and completeness.  When using a natural language to communicate with other people, human authors and speakers can be ambiguous and make small errors, and still expect their intent to be understood. However, computers do exactly what they are told to do, and cannot understand the code the programmer "intended" to write.  The combination of the language definition, the [[program]], and the program's inputs must fully specify the external behavior that occurs when the program is executed.<br/>+<br/>+Many languages have been designed from scratch, altered to meet new needs, combined with other languages, and eventually fallen into disuse.  Although there have been attempts to design one "universal" computer language that serves all purposes, all of them have failed to be accepted in this role.<ref>IBM in first publishing PL/I, for example, rather ambitiously titled its manual ''The universal programming language PL/I'' (IBM Library; 1966).

[[Ada programming language|Ada]] and [[UNCOL]] had similar early goals.</ref>  The need for diverse computer languages arises from the diversity of contexts in which languages are used:<br/>+<br/>+* Programs range from tiny scripts written by individual hobbyists to huge systems written by hundreds of programmers.<br/>+* Programmers range in expertise from novices who need simplicity above all else, to experts who may be comfortable with considerable complexity.<br/>+* Programs must balance speed, size, and simplicity on systems ranging from [[microcontroller]]s to [[supercomputer]]s.  <br/>+* Programs may be written once and not change for generations, or they may undergo nearly constant modification.<br/>+* Finally, programmers may simply differ in their tastes:  they may be accustomed to discussing problems and expressing them in a particular language.  <br/>+<br/>+One common trend in the development of programming languages has been to add more ability to solve problems using a higher level of [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]].  The earliest programming languages were tied very closely to the underlying hardware of the computer.  As new programming languages have developed, features have been added that let programmers express ideas that are more removed from simple translation into underlying hardware instructions.  Because programmers are less tied to the needs of the computer, their programs can do more computing with less effort from the programmer.  This lets them write more programs in the same amount of time. <ref> Frederick P.

Most programming languages are purely textual; they use sequences of text including words, numbers, and punctuation, much like written natural languages.  On the other hand, there are some programming languages which are more [[visual programming language|graphical]] in nature, using spatial relationships between symbols to specify a program.<br/>+<br/>+The syntax of a language describes the possible combinations of symbols that form a syntactically correct program.  The meaning given to a combination of symbols is handled by semantics.  Since most languages are textual, this article discusses textual syntax.<br/>+<br/>+Programming language syntax is usually defined using a combination of [[regular expression]]s (for [[lexical analysis|lexical]] structure) and [[Backus-Naur Form]] (for [[context-free grammar|grammatical]] structure).  Below is a simple grammar, based on [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]]:<br/>+<br/>+<code><br/>+expression ::= atom   | list<br/><br/>+atom       ::= number | symbol<br/>    <br/>+number     ::= [+-]?['0'-'9']+<br/><br/>+symbol     ::= ['A'-'Z'<nowiki>'</nowiki>a'-'z'].*<br/><br/>+list       ::= '(' expression* ')'<br/><br/>+</code><br/>+<br/>+This grammar specifies the following:<br/>+* an ''expression'' is either an ''atom'' or a ''list'';<br/>+* an ''atom'' is either a ''number'' or a ''symbol'';<br/>+* a ''number'' is an unbroken sequence of one or more decimal digits, optionally preceded by a plus or minus sign;<br/>+* a ''symbol'' is a letter followed by zero or more of any characters (excluding whitespace); and<br/>+* a ''list'' is a matched pair of parentheses, with zero or more ''expressions'' inside it.<br/>+<br/>+The following are examples of well-formed token sequences in this grammar: '<code>12345</code>', '<code>()</code>', '<code>(a b c232 (1))</code>'<br/>+<br/>+Not all syntactically correct programs are semantically correct.  Many syntactically correct programs are nonetheless ill-formed, per the language's rules; and may (depending on the language specification and the soundness of the implementation) result in an error on translation or execution.  In some cases, such programs may exhibit [[undefined behavior]].  Even when a program is well-defined within a language, it may still have a meaning that is not intended by the person who wrote it.  <br/>+<br/>+Using [[natural language]] as an example, it may not be possible to assign a meaning to a grammatically correct sentence or the sentence may be false:<br/>+* "[[Colorless green ideas sleep furiously]]." is grammatically well-formed but has no generally accepted meaning.<br/>+* "John is a married bachelor." is grammatically well-formed but expresses a meaning that cannot be true.<br/>+<br/>+The following C language fragment is syntactically correct, but performs an operation that is not semantically defined (because <tt>p</tt> is a [[null pointer]], the operations <tt>p->real</tt> and <tt>p->im</tt> have no meaning):<br/>+<br/>+ complex *p = NULL;<br/>+ complex abs_p = sqrt (p->real * p->real + p->im * p->im);<br/>+<br/>+===Type system===<br/>+{{details|Type system}}<br/>+<br/>+A type system defines how a programming language classifies values and expressions into ''types'', how it can manipulate those types and how they interact.  This generally includes a description of the [[data structure]]s that can be constructed in the language.  The design and study of type systems using formal mathematics is known as ''[[type theory]]''. <br/>+<br/>+Internally, all [[data]] in modern digital computers are stored simply as zeros or ones ([[Binary numeral system|binary]]). The data typically represent information in the real world such as names, bank accounts and measurements, so the low-level binary data are organized by programming languages into these high-level concepts as [[data type]]s. There are also more abstract types whose purpose is just to warn the programmer about semantically meaningless statements or verify safety properties of programs.<br/>+<br/>+Languages can be classified with respect to their type systems. <br/>+<br/>+====Typed vs untyped languages==== <br/>+<br/>+A language is ''typed'' if operations defined for one data type cannot be performed on values of another data type.<ref name="typing">{{cite web | url=http://www.acooke.org/andrew/writing/lang.html#sec-types | author=Andrew Cooke | title=An Introduction to Programming Languages | accessdate=June 30 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> For example, "text" is a string. In most programming languages, dividing a number by a string has no meaning. Most modern programming languages will therefore reject any program attempting to perform such an operation. In some languages, the meaningless operation will be detected when the program is compiled ("static" type checking), and rejected by the compiler, while in others, it will be detected when the program is run ("dynamic" type checking), resulting in a runtime [[Exception handling|exception]].<br/>+<br/>+By opposition, an ''untyped language'', such as most [[Assembly language|assembly languages]], allows any operation to be performed on any data type.<ref name="typing"/>.  High-level languages which are untyped include [[BCPL]] and some varieties of [[Forth]].<br/>+<br/>+In practice, while few languages are considered typed from the point of view of [[type theory]] (verifying or rejecting ''all'' operations), most modern languages offer a degree of typing.<ref name="typing"/>.  Many production languages provide means to bypass or subvert the type system.<br/>+<br/>+====Static vs dynamic typing====<br/>+<br/>+In ''[[static typing]]'' all expressions have their types determined prior to the program being run (typically at compile-time).  For example, 1 and (2+2) are integer expressions; they cannot be passed to a function that expects a string, or stored in a variable that is defined to hold dates.<ref name="typing"/><br/>+<br/>+Statically-typed languages can be ''manifestly typed'' or ''[[type inference|type-inferred]]''.  In the first case, the programmer must explicitly write types at certain textual positions (for example, at variable [[declaration (computer science)|declaration]]s).  In the second case, the compiler ''infers'' the types of expressions and declarations based on context.  Most mainstream statically-typed languages, such as [[C Plus Plus|C++]] and [[Java programming language|Java]], are manifestly typed.  Complete type inference has traditionally been associated with less mainstream languages, such as [[Haskell programming language|Haskell]] and [[ML programming language|ML]].  However, many manifestly typed languages support partial type inference; for example, [[Java programming language|Java]] and [[C Sharp|C#]] both infer types in certain limited cases.<ref>Specifically, instantiations of [[generic programming|generic]] types are inferred for certain expression forms.  Type inference in Generic Java—the research language that provided the basis for Java 1.5's bounded [[parametric polymorphism]] extensions—is discussed in two informal manuscripts from the [[Types mailing list]]: [http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~sweirich/types/archive/1999-2003/msg00849.html Generic Java type inference is unsound] ([[Alan Jeffrey]], 17 Dec 2001) and [http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~sweirich/types/archive/1999-2003/msg00921.html Sound Generic Java type inference] ([[Martin Odersky]], 15 Jan 2002).  C#'s type system is similar to Java's, and uses a similar partial type inference scheme.</ref><br/>+<br/>+''Dynamic typing'', also called ''latent typing'', determines the type-safety of operations at runtime; in other words, types are associated with ''runtime values'' rather than ''textual expressions''.<ref name="typing"/>  As with type-inferred languages, dynamically typed languages do not require the programmer to write explicit type annotations on expressions.  Among other things, this may permit a single variable to refer to values of different types at different points in the program execution.  However, type errors cannot be automatically detected until a piece of code is actually executed, making debugging more difficult.  [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]], [[JavaScript]], and [[Python programming language|Python]] are dynamically typed.<br/>+<br/>+====Weak and strong====<br/>+<br/>+''Weak typing'' allows a value of one type to be treated as another, for example treating a string as a number.<ref name="typing"/>  This can occasionally be useful, but it can also cause bugs; such languages are often termed ''unsafe''.  [[C programming language|C]], [[C++]], and most [[assembly language|assembly languages]] are often described as weakly typed.<br/>+<br/>+''Strong typing'' prevents the above.  Attempting to mix types raises an error.<ref name="typing"/>  Strongly-typed languages are often termed ''type-safe'' or ''[[type safety|safe]]'', but they do not make bugs impossible.  [[Ada]], [[Python programming language|Python]], and [[ML programming language|ML]] are strongly typed.<br/>+<br/>+An alternate definition for "weakly typed" refers to languages, such as [[Perl]], [[Javascript]], and [[C++]] which permit a large number of implicit type conversions{{fact}}.  The expression <tt>"123" + 45</tt> is legal in Javascript; and produces the result <tt>168</tt>; in evaluating the expression, a Javascript engine will note that the string "123" is convertable to a number, implicitly perform the conversion, and then add 123 and 45 to produce the final sum.  However, note that the expression <tt>"123" + "45"</tt> is <tt>"12345"</tt> (and neither <tt>168</tt> nor <tt>"168"</tt>); the <tt>+</tt> operator when applied to strings in Javascript performs string concatenation.  This capability is often useful, but occasionally dangerous; as it may permit operations which the programmer didn't intend to succeed, often producing unexpected results.   <br/>+<br/>+''Strong'' and ''static'' are generally considered orthogonal concepts, but usage in the literature differs.  Some use the term ''strongly typed'' to mean ''strongly, statically typed'', or, even more confusingly, to mean simply ''statically typed''.  Thus [[C programming language|C]] has been called both strongly typed and weakly, statically typed.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-4.html | title=Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme (February 20, 1998) | accessdate=June 9 | accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/cardelli85understanding.html | title=On Understanding Types, Data Abstraction, and Polymorphism | author=[[Luca Cardelli]] and [[Peter Wegner]] | work=Manuscript (1985) | accessdate=June 9 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>.<br/>+<br/>+===Execution semantics===<br/>+<br/>+Once data has been specified, the machine must be instructed to perform operations on the data.  The ''execution semantics'' of a language defines how and when the various constructs of a language should produce a program behavior.<br/>+<br/>+For example, the semantics may define the [[evaluation strategy|strategy]] by which expressions are evaluated to values, or the manner in which [[control structure]]s conditionally execute statements.<br/>+<br/>+===Standard library===<br/>+{{details|Standard library}}<br/>+<br/>+Most programming languages have an associated [[library (computer science)|standard library]], which is conventionally made available in all implementations of the language. Standard libraries typically include definitions for commonly used algorithms, data structures, and mechanisms for input and output.<br/>+<br/>+Often, a language's standard library is treated as part of the language by its designers and users.  Most language specifications define a standard library that must be made available in all conforming implementations.  The line between a language and its standard library is therefore porous.  Indeed, some languages are designed so that the meanings of certain syntactic constructs cannot even be described without referring to the standard library.  For example, in Java, a string literal is defined as an instance of the <tt>java.lang.String</tt> class from the standard library; similarly, in Smalltalk, an anonymous function expression (a "block") constructs an instance of the standard library's <tt>BlockContext</tt> class.  Conversely, [[Scheme programming language|Scheme]] contains multiple coherent subsets that suffice to construct the rest of the language as library macros, and so the language designers do not even bother to say which portions of the language must be implemented as language constructs, and which must be implemented as parts of the standard library.<br/>+<br/>+== Practice ==<br/>+A language's designers and users must construct a number of artifacts that govern and enable the practice of programming.  The most important of these artifacts are the language's ''specification'' and ''implementation''.<br/>+<br/>+===Specification===<br/>+{{details|Programming language specification}}<br/>+The '''specification''' of a programming language is intended to provide a definition that language [[programmer|user]]s and [[programming language implementation|implementors]] can use to interpret the behavior of [[program]]s when reading their [[source code]].<br/>+<br/>+A programming language specification can take several forms, including the following:<br/>+<br/>+* An explicit definition of the syntax and semantics of the language. While  syntax is commonly specified using a formal grammar, semantic definitions may be written in [[natural language]] (e.g., the [[C language]]), or a [[formal semantics of programming languages|formal semantics]] (e.g., the [[Standard ML]] <ref>{{cite book<br/>+   | last = Milner<br/>+   | first = R.<br/>+   | authorlink = Robin Milner<br/>+   | coauthors = [[Mads Tofte|M.

The syntax and semantics of the language has to be inferred from this description, which may be written in natural or a formal language.<br/>+* A ''model'' implementation, sometimes written in the language being specified (e.g., [[Prolog]]). The syntax and semantics of the language are explicit in the behavior of the model implementation.<br/>+<br/>+===Implementation===<br/>+{{details|Programming language implementation}}<br/>+An '''implementation''' of a programming language provides a way to execute that program on one or more configurations of hardware and software.  There are, broadly, two approaches to programming language implementation: ''[[compiler|compilation]]'' and ''[[interpreter (computing)|interpretation]]''.  Some implementations support both interpretation and compilation.<br/>+<br/>+An interpreter [[parsing|parses]] a computer program and executes it directly.  This can be imagined as following the instructions of the program line-by-line.  By contrast, a compiler translates the program into another language, which may in turn be either interpreted or compiled.  Some compilers translate a program into [[machine code]] (instructions that can be interpreted directly by a piece of computing [[hardware]]).<br/>+<br/>+Programs compiled to machine code usually run faster than interpreted ones, because the work of parsing and translating the programming language has already been done.  However, interpreters are frequently easier to write than compilers.{{fact}}<br/>+<br/>+Many modern languages use a mixture of compilation and interpretation.  The "compiler" for a [[bytecode]]-based language translates the source code into a partially compiled intermediate format, which is later run by a fast interpreter called a [[virtual machine]].   Some "interpreters" actually use a [[just-in-time compiler]], which compiles the code to machine language immediately before running it.  These techniques are often combined.  An unusual case is [[Forth programming language|Forth]], which is described as incrementally compiled.  Like other aspects of programming languages, "compiled" and "interpreted" may be best understood as opposite ends of a spectrum, rather than as discrete options.<br/>+<br/>+== History ==<br/>+[[Image:Programming language textbooks.jpg|thumb|230px|right|A selection of textbooks that teach programming, in languages both popular and obscure.

At a practical level, punch cards were used by the beginning of the 20th Century to encode data and perform limited mechanical processing; even before that "programmable" looms and [[player piano]] scrolls implemented limited [[domain-specific programming language]]s.  In the 1930s and 1940s, the formalisms of [[Alonzo Church]]'s [[lambda calculus]] and [[Alan Turing]]'s [[Turing machine]]s provided mathematical abstractions for expressing [[algorithm]]s; the lambda calculus remains influential in language design.<ref>Benjamin C.

Machine language programming was quickly superceded by [[Assembly_language|assembly language programming]].  Later in the 1950s, assembly language programming, which had evolved to include the use of [[macro instruction]]s, was followed by the development of three modern programming languages: [[FORTRAN]], [[Lisp programming language|LISP]], and [[COBOL]].

[[C_Plus_Plus|C++]] combined object-oriented and systems programming.  The United States government standardized [[Ada programming language|Ada]], a systems programming language intended for use by defense contractors.  In Japan and elsewhere, vast sums were spent investigating so-called "fifth generation" languages that incorporated logic programming constructs.  The functional languages community moved to standardize ML and Lisp.  Rather than inventing new paradigms, all of these movements elaborated upon the ideas invented in the previous decade.<br/>+<br/>+One important trend in language design during the 1980s was an increased focus on programming for large-scale systems through the use of ''modules'', or large-scale organizational units of code.  [[Modula-2]], Ada, and ML all developed notable module systems in the 1980s.  Module systems were often wedded to [[generic programming]] constructs.<br/>+<br/>+The rapid growth of the [[Internet]] in the mid-1990's created opportunities for new languages.  [[Perl]], originally a Unix scripting tool, became common in dynamic [[Web site]]s.  [[Java programming language|Java]] came to be used for server-side programming.  These developments were not fundamentally novel, rather they were refinements to existing languages and paradigms.<br/>+<br/>+Programming language evolution continues, in both industry and research.  Current directions include security and reliability verification, new kinds of modularity ([[mixin]]s, [[delegation|delegates]], [[aspect-oriented programming|aspects]]), database integration, and the "[[Free and Open Source Software]]" development philosophy.<br/>+<br/>+== Taxonomies ==<br/>+{{details|Categorical list of programming languages}}<br/>+There is no overarching classification scheme for programming languages.  Any given programming language does not usually have a single ancestor language.  Languages commonly arise by combining the elements of several predecessor languages with new ideas in circulation at the time.  Ideas that originate in one language will diffuse throughout a family of related languages, and then leap suddenly across familial gaps to appear in an entirely different family.<br/>+<br/>+The task is further complicated by the fact that languages can be classified along multiple axes.  For example, Java is both an object-oriented language (because it encourages object-oriented organization) and a concurrent language (because it contains built-in constructs for running multiple [[thread]]s in parallel).  [[Python programming language|Python]] is an object-oriented [[scripting language]].<br/>+<br/>+In broad strokes, programming languages divide into ''[[programming paradigm]]s'' and a classification by ''intended domain of use''.  Paradigms include [[procedural programming]], [[object-oriented programming]], [[functional programming]], and [[logic programming]]; some languages are hybrids of paradigms or multi-paradigmatic.  An [[assembly language]] is not so much a paradigm as a direct model of an underlying machine architecture.  By purpose, programming languages might be considered general purpose, system programming languages, scripting languages, domain-specific languages, or concurrent/distributed languages (or a combination of these).  Some general purpose languages were designed largely with educational goals. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Wirth|first=Niklaus|authorlink=Niklaus Wirth|title=Recollections about the development of Pascal|journal=Proc. 2nd [[ACM SIGPLAN]] conference on history of programming languages|pages=333–342|year=1993|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=155378|accessdate=2006-06-30}}</ref><br/>+<br/>+==See also==<br/>+*[[Comparison of programming languages]]<br/>+*[[Computer language]]<br/>+*[[Formal semantics of programming languages]]<br/>+*[[List of hello world programs]], examples of a simple program in many different programming languages<br/>+*[[Literate programming]]<br/>+*[[Programming language dialect]]<br/>+*[[Programming language theory]]<br/>+*[[Software engineering]] and [[List of software engineering topics]]<br/>+<br/>+== References ==<br/>+<div class="references-small"><br/>+<references/><br/>+</div><br/>+<br/>+==Further reading==<br/>+*David Gelernter, Suresh Jagannathan: ''Programming Linguistics'', The MIT Press 1990.<br/>+*Samuel N.

In regards to "Asian", it can be said that North Asians, East Asians, and Southeast Asians, Nordic Countries, and Eastern India are physically Mongoloid, however most [[South Asians]] are identified as Caucasoid, and many Eastern Europeans, Central Europeans, some East Asians, Central Asians tend to intermediate between Mongoloids and Caucasoids.

For these reasons, the usage of the term Mongoloid for racial purposes has acquired offensive connotations for some people.  Due to this offensive use, the term Eastern [[Eurasia|Eurasian]] has been proposed as a [[euphemism]] for the term Mongoloid.<br/>+[[Category:Municipalities in Zaragoza]]<br/> <br/>-== Geographic range ==<br/>-The Mongoloid classification has long been debated as to whom it includes, even today. There has been much debate over what constitutes a race.<br/>-<br/>-As a form of classification by [[Carleton S. Coon]] (1904-1981), "Mongoloid" includes the indigenous peoples of [[North Asia]], [[East Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]], and some parts of [[Central Asia]] and [[South Asia]]. Most people from South Asia are usually classified as [[Caucasoid]], while most of those from Central Asia as intermediate.<br/>-<br/>-By extension, Mongoloid arguably includes [[Polynesians]] from the [[Pacific Ocean|mid-Pacific]] [[Oceania]], the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]], those of [[Greenland]], some indigenous populations of [[Northern Europe]] (eg. the [[Sami]] of [[Finland]]) and some [[Eastern Europe]]ans who are said to have Mongoloid admixture and whose cranial morphology ([[brachycephalic]]y, high [[zygoma]]s, etc.) but not pigmentation ([[blond|blondism]], [[eye color]], etc) more closely resemble those of Mongoloids than Caucasoids.<br/>-<br/>-Mongoloid peoples may be the most spread out among all human populations, according to [[Carleton S. Coon|Carleton S. Coon's]] defintion. They have stretched almost completely around the earth's surface as either aboriginals (the first to arrive in a given region) or as conquering migrants. They can be found as far "east" as Greenland, and yet also as far to the "west" as [[Kalmykia]], the [[Crimea]], and even [[Scandinavia]], giving Asiatic peoples or their descendants a historical presence across the vast expanse of four continents.  Their majority only increases if the Greek Wikipedia's definition is used.<br/>-<br/>-==Mongoloid variation==<br/>-<br/>-===Northern Mongoloid===<br/>-The [[Northern Mongoloid]] peoples are from North Asia also known as [[East Asia]]. They have somewhat hairier bodies than other Mongoloid type, and their facial features are quite sharp.<br/>-<br/>-Farther to the south and east of interior Asia, the northern and interior the [[Japanese people|Japanese]], [[Koreans]], northern [[Han Chinese]], and [[Manchu]]s also continue to inherit these other prototypical physical features. Other Northern Mongoloids include many smaller groups in Central Asia and the Arctic regions such as the [[Buryats]], [[Chukchis]], [[Tuvans]], [[Nivkhs]], [[Evenki]], [[Yakuts]], Siberian [[Inuit]], [[Tibetans]], and [[Mongolians]].<br/>-<br/>-The indigenous [[Ainu people]] of [[Japan]] are also grouped into the northern Mongoloids, however, they are an archaic type. Some of their characteristics are considered Caucasoid. In the early 20th century [[anthropology|anthropologists]] debated on what [[Typology#Anthropology|typological classification]] the Ainu belonged to. The typological models of [[Race (historical definitions)|racial classification]] in use at that time have since undergone significant revision, in the light of developments in fields such as [[genetics]].<br/>-<br/>-===Han Chinese Mongoloid===<br/>-The [[Han Chinese]] are by far the most populous and heterogeneous Mongoloid "group". Indeed, the Han are often said to be the largest single group of any race, however, they are really not a truly coherent single ethnicity. The concept of a unified group of Han Chinese is more so a cultural anthropological concept rather than a biological anthropological one.<br/>-<br/>-Studies have shown that the [[North China|North Chinese]] are closer to Northern Mongoloids such as [[Korean people|Korean]]s and [[Japanese people|Japanese]], while the [[South China|South Chinese]] are closer to their immediate Southern counterparts like the [[Tai peoples|Tai]] and [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]]. <!-- ***NEEDS CITATION*** However there is also much evidence to support that the modern Han Chinese have descended from the south, due to the predominance of the O3/M122-type Y-gene, which traces its origin to Southwest China. --><br/>-These two classifications are only examples of the considerable diversity within the Han Chinese ethnic group; further examples include population samples from the [[Shanghai]] and [[Jiangsu]] areas which share both Northern Mongoloid and Southern Mongoloid characteristics in addition to having genetically unique characteristics not found in other Han populations, suggesting integration of indigenous peoples unique to its location. <sup>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=12939805&dopt=Abstract] [http://evolutsioon.ut.ee/publications/Yao2002.pdf]</sup><br/>-===Southern Mongoloid===<br/>-The peoples of the majority of continental [[Southeast Asia]], specifically those who are located west of the Annamite Mountain range, including [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], and the [[Philippines]] are [[Southern Mongoloid]]s. They are considered Mongoloid according to the four-race theory {{facts}}, however, they are genetically distinct from their neighbors to the north and may be considered a Southern Mongoloid race {{facts}}.<br/>-<br/>-The Southern Mongoloid is typically shorter-nosed, with quite hairless bodies, and tend to be slender. Starting with the southern [[Han Chinese]] of the southeastern coast, they are believed to be adapted to damper climates and allegedly mixed with [[Austronesian]] prototypes migrating to the Pacific Ocean. <br/>-<br/>-In Southeast Asia, these Southern Mongoloids have assimilated, mixed in with, or replaced Australoids in some areas. Some [[Pacific Islander]]s or [[Polynesian culture|Polynesian]]s may also be considered Mongoloids, although in this area of the world, Australoids and Mongoloids have hybridised considerably and the lines between the two "races" are blurred.<br/>-<br/>-Although the [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]], whom are located and originate to the northeast of the Annamite Mountain Range, are geographically labelled as "Southeast Asians", their ethnic and cultural heritage ties them to their immediate northern neighbours, the Southern Chinese and other tribes within the proximity of [[South China]].<br/>-<br/>-The 19th century anthropologist [[Thomas Huxley]] considered [[North-East India|Northeast]] and [[East India]] to be pure Mongoloids. <ref>Huxley, Thomas.

See [[Models of migration to the New World]]. The earlier known inhabitants of the continent are the Amerindians, and they are distinct from the subsequent migrations who would become the indigenous populations of [[Arctic]] [[North America]] (the various [[Alaska]]n and indigenous Arctic [[Canada|Canadian]] groups such as the [[Inuit]], [[Innu]], and [[Aleut]]s).<br/>-<br/>-The indigenous groups of Arctic North America &mdash; including the [[Haida]] people of [[British Columbia]] on the northwest coast &mdash; can often resemble Central Asians and even Northern Asians (such as [[Koreans]] or [[Japanese people|Japanese]]), making them much closer to the Northern Mongoloid type than even Southeast Asians.<br/>-<br/>-The [[Amerindian]]s, however, are often considered a separate population pool to, or at most a distant division of, Mongoloids. The Amerindians branched off of archaic or proto-Mongoloids from [[Siberia]] and other parts of [[Northeast Asia]], including the [[Ainu people|Ainu]] or such groups related to them (See [[Kennewick man]]). From that point in time, when they crossed over to [[North America]] and dispersed into [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]], they evolved independently for tens of thousands of years ago, not coming into contact with any Old World populations until the arrival of Europeans just over 500 years ago. This large time gap of separate isolated evolution resulted in certain distinct genetic and physical characteristics not found in Old World Mongoloids or the indigenous groups of Arctic North America. <br/>-<br/>-The indigenous groups of Arctic North America are always clustered with Old World Mongoloids due to their recent arrival and their shared evolution.<br/>-<br/>-===Northeast European Mongoloid===<br/>-The 19th century anthropologist [[Thomas Huxley]] considered the [[Nordic countries]] and [[Russia]] to be Mongoloids.  He classified the nations of [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] to be a Mongoloid and Xanothrochoi mix, but [[Finland]] and [[Russia]] were completely Mongoloid. <ref>Huxley, Thomas.

On the Geographical Distribution of the Chief Modifications of Mankind. 1870. August 14, 2006.  <http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/SM3/GeoDis.html>.</ref>Although recent genetic studies suggest that humans ancestral in part to both today's Mongoloids and [[Caucasoid]]s migrated to Central Asia from [[South Asia]] or the [[Middle East]] 40-50 thousand years ago, much of modern Central Asians' ancestry is thought to stem from later migrations from the west (such as the [[Tocharians]] and [[Indo-Iranians]]) and from the east (such as various [[Turkic peoples]] and the [[Mongols]]); migration from South Asia had less of an impact in this later period. See also [[History of Central Asia]].<br/>-<br/>-Excluding the effects of 19th and 20th century [[Russians|Russian]] and [[Han Chinese]] colonization, Mongoloid elements are strongest among the northern traditionally nomadic peoples such as the [[Kyrgyz]], [[Kazakhs]], and [[Mongols]]. The farming populations further south like the [[Uzbeks]] and [[Uyghur]]s show both northern Mongoloid and [[Mediterranean race|Mediterranean]] Caucasoid traits. There is no sharp distinction in appearance between the Uzbeks who speak a [[Turkic language]] and their close neighbors the [[Tajiks]] who speak an [[Iranian language]]; traditionally, mixture and [[bilingualism]] were very common, until  boundaries based on [[Nationalism#Language and Nationalism|linguistic nationalism]] were drawn in the 20th century. In general, Caucasoid traits increase away from the steppes and in mountains such as the [[Pamirs]]. However, the [[Hazara]] are a southern outlier of part-Mongoloids in the [[Hindu Kush]] mountains of central [[Afghanistan]].<br/>-<br/>-===Transitional Mongoloids:Greeks and Turks===<br/>-The 19th century anthropologist [[Thomas Huxley]] considered [[Greece]] and western [[Turkey]] a Mongoloids and Melanochroi racial mix. <ref>Huxley, Thomas.  On the Geographical Distribution of the Chief Modifications of Mankind. 1870. August 14, 2006.  <http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/SM3/GeoDis.html>.</ref><br/>-<br/>-===Transitional Mongoloids:Osteuropids===<br/>-The [[19th century]] [[Germany|German]] [[physical anthropologist]] [[Egon Freiherr von Eickstedt]] considered the Central and Eastern European to be transitional Mongoloids called Osteuropids.  He determined that the blonde hair of Eastern and Central Europeans prevented them from being a mix of Nordics and Mongoloids, but he also considered them to be physically mongoloid.  He concluded they represented a new racial type of transitional Mongoloids which was the common ancestor of Nordics and Mongoloids.  He named these transitional Mongoloids Osteuropids.  Osteuropids posses Mongoloid physical characteristics such as brachycephalization but have the blondism of Nordics.  Eickstedt considered their racial type to be a primitive one that has stopped evolving.<br/>-<br/>-===Transitional Mongoloids:Lappish===<br/>-The [[20th century]] [[physical anthropologist]] [[Carleton S. Coon]] hypothesized that the [[Lapps]] in Northern Europe were either a mixture of Caucasoid and Mongoloid races or he hypothesized they were a lesser evolved form of Caucasoid which retained its previous Mongoloid characteristics.  Coon called this subrace the Lappish.  Whatever the case he concluded that they have currently mixed with the Nordic subrace due to their close proximity to Nordics.<ref>Coon, Carleton S. The Races of Europe. Racial Classification within the White Family.  August 11, 2006. <http://www.snpa.nordish.net/chapter-VIII6.htm>.</ref><br/>-<br/>-===Transitional Mongoloids:Tibetans===<br/>-The 20th century phsyical anthropologist [[Hans F.K. Günther]] concluded that the [[Tibet|Tibetans]] had physical characteristics between Nordics and Mongoloids.  He concluded that they represented a transitional Mongoloid which was more racially evolved than other Mongoloids.<br/>-<br/>-==Unrelated populations as "Mongoloid" in forensics==<br/>-<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Kun san.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Khoisan]] man]] --><br/>-:''Main article: [[Caucasoid, Negroid, Mongoloid#Strict usage as skull types in forensics|Forensic classification of race]]''<br/>-The [[Khoisan]] of southwestern [[Africa]] share some characteristics typical of Mongoloids, such as epicanthic folds but more importantly craniology. {{cite needed}} On the other hand, features such as skin and hair texture are markedly different and resemble other sub-Saharan African populations. They have been proven to be not any more genetically related to Mongoloids than they are to other non-Africans.<br/>-<br/>-The [[Chleuh]] of southern Morocco are another African population who have been said to have some features reminiscent of Asians.<br/>-<br/>-In [[forensic anthropology]], however, remains are often classified into one of the three populations: Black, White, or Asian. In U.S. legal practice, these are respectively termed "Negroid," "Caucasoid," and "Mongoloid". Based on these parameters, populations genetically unrelated to Mongoloids, such as the Khoisan, are found to be "Mongoloid". {{cite needed}}<br/>-<br/>-*''See also: [[Craniofacial Anthropometry]]''<br/>-<br/>-==Characteristic features==<br/>-Physical characteristics typical of Mongoloids include oblique palpebral fissures that create almond-shaped eyes, also known as [[epicanthal fold]]s. The presence of epicanthic folds is most prevalent in people of East Asian and Southeast Asian descent.<br/>-<br/>-The overwhelming majority also exhibit the [[Mongolian spot]], which is a natural smooth brown or blue-gray birthmark usually on the lower back and buttocks area of infants and is visible up to about age four. This feature, however, is not unique to Mongoloids, and may be found among European and African populations although at a much reduced frequency.<br/>-<br/>-The vast majority of Mongoloids have straight black hair and dark brown eyes. Dark brown hair and lighter brown do occur, but less so. The occurrence of grey eyes and even blue eyes has been observed among a few Central Asian Mongoloids and [[Mongolians]], however, this could be from a Caucasoid continuum. Curly hair is not uncommon in [[North China]] and [[Korea]]; and wavy hair occurs in any Mongoloid  population. Skin pigmentation varies significantly. The skin's undertone is usually yellowish, but the actual pigmentation may go from very pale, to pale and light brown, medium brown, to dark brown and extremely dark.<br/>-<br/>-Cranial morphology is typically [[brachycephalic]] (round-headed) with high-set [[zygoma]] (cheekbones). Faces are relatively broad and flat, while noses are typically small with low nasal bridges and minimal nasal projection. Body hair is scarce and sweat glands are also fewer. Nevertheless, [[mesocephalic]] craniology (intermediate between round and oval), somewhat higher nasal bridges, and greater facial and body hair may sometimes also occur.<br/>-<br/>-Note that among the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|New World Mongoloids]], or more specifically the people who are not the indigenous populations of [[Arctic]] [[North America]], the occurrence of epicanthal folds is almost absent; skin pigmentations may also go from pale to light, medium, and dark brown, but the undertone is reddish; and larger often "hooked" noses, with high nasal bridges and great nasal projection are most common.<br/>-<br/>-The "prototypic" Mongoloid features seem to have originated among those who originate from drier, arid, or colder inland or northern regions. Whereas tropical and damper weather along the [[Pacific]] coast or in the proximity of the [[Equator]] seems to have contributed to significantly less body and facial hair. The same might also be argued for Africans.<br/>-<br/>-== Genetic history ==<br/>-According to a modern anthropological textbook ''The Human Species'' (2003), there only exists "continuous variation" of races and not "discrete units", but historically Mongoloid populations are considered to be a division of the Eurasian Supercluster, which comprises both Caucasoids (Western Eurasians) and Mongoloids (Eastern Eurasians). Historically it had been believed that the Mongoloids split from the Caucasoids, the Mongoloids themselves divided into the [[Northern Mongoloid]] ([[Northeast Asia]]ns) and [[Southern Mongoloid]] (Southeast Asians and [[Pacific Islander]]s) Mongoloid groups. Historically it was believed the New World Mongoloids are a group that branched off the Northern Mongoloid population before crossing into the [[New World]].<br/>-<br/>-According to ''The Human Species'' (2003) and ''Physical Anthropology'', humanity can be divided into two major braches: the African branch and the non-African branch.  The non-African branch includes two subgroups, one Eurasian and the other Oceanic.  The Eurasian and Oceanic branches are the products of this common origin.  The Eurasian branch split into the Caucasoid and Mongoloid branches.  The Mongoloid branch then divided into the East Asian subgroup and the Amerindian subgroup.  The Oceanic branch divided into the Southeast Asian subgroup and the Pacific Islander subgroup. According to ''The Human Species'' (2003), [[East Asian]]s generally are more genetically similar to the [[South Asian]]s than to [[Southeast Asian]]s, because the Far East and the Indian Subcontinent are members of the Eurasian branch while Southeast Asians (including southern Chinese) are members or the Oceanic branch. More interestingly, Asians have very local genetic clusters inside these regions, implying different Asian ethnic groups have not historically intermarried with each other. Examples of localized genetic clusters include Japan, Korea, Mongolia and China which form separate genetic clusters from each other.<ref>John Relethford, The Human Species: An introduction to Biological Anthropology, 5th ed. (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2003). <br/>-</ref><ref>Philip L. Stein and Bruce M. Rowe, Physical Anthropology, 8th ed. (McGraw-Hill, 1996)</ref> <br/>-<br/>-These various divisions of humanity have interbred throughout [[history]] and [[pre-history]], making racial classification a more generalised form of taxonomy than an absolute one. According to the above reference: "There has never been a clear consensus on the actual number (of races), though".<br/>-<br/>-==Relation to race as a social construct and racial politics==<br/>-The concept that [[North Asian]]s, [[East Asian]]s, [[Southeast Asian]]s, [[Pacific Islander]]s, [[Indigenous American]]s and others identified as Mongoloids are the same race is accepted more in some parts of the world than in others.  In East and Southeast Asia, it is more common to think of each nation as its own race or unique people, because of the relative homogeneity in most of these states. In fact, China and Indonesia are the only two states in the region to have blatantly heterogenous populations.  <br/>-Generally in less developed parts of the globe, racial definitions such as the Mongoloid race are more widely accepted, because of the low availability of contemporary scientific research.  <br/>-<br/>-See [[Asian people]] for discussion in more depth, as this issue is outside the scope of this article.<br/>-<br/>-==Footnotes==<br/>-<references/><br/>-<br/>-==External links==<br/>-*[http://kennethomura.tripod.com/asian_skulls/ Asian Skulls] This website discusses the variation in Asian skulls. <!-- This external link should be on this page because the website discusses the skulls of East Asians and Southeast Asians which the Mongoloid page deals with because it talks about skull type.

In practice, since the mid 1800s, the country has been limited to a [[two-party system]] with occasional inlets made by third parties. This is largely due to the fact that the United States does not have a [[parliamentary system]]; it may also be a consequence of the [[Plurality voting system|first-past-the-post election system]] and restrictive [[ballot access]] laws imposed on the other political parties.

The first section is “Current major parties”, as the term is defined above. The second section is called “Current third parties” and it consists of those parties that have achieved (or, in the lead-up to an election, are reasonably expected to achieve) ballot status for their respective candidates for [[President of the United States]] in states with enough [[U.S. Electoral College|electoral votes]] to have a theoretical chance of winning. The third section is called “Current minor and regional parties that have endorsed candidates” and consists of all the other currently active parties which have candidates (so-called “political parties” with candidates listed). The last section, “Historical political parties”, is for political parties that are defunct.  It can be argued that since no party other than the Republican and Democratic parties, have the voting power to win major elections, it would be wise for smaller parties to unite under one umbrella thus strenghtening their voting base/power.

He is the host of ''[[This Is Your Day]]'', a 30-minute television show on various religious networks, including [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]], [[Daystar Television Network]] and [[The God Channel]].<br/>+<br/>+He is well known for his flamboyant, highly theatrical and often controversial style of ministry, at which members of the congregation and the choir are frequently "[[slain in the Spirit]]" en masse, and healings of medical conditions, whether [[Lou Gehrig's disease]], [[AIDS]], [[arthritis]] or [[cancer]], are televised from the stage. He hosts regular "Miracle Crusades" – [[revival meeting]]/[[faith healing]] summits that are usually held in large stadiums in major cities.<br/>+<br/>+He is married to [[Suzanne Harthern]] and resides in [[Dana Point, California]].<br/>+<br/>+==History==<br/>+Benny Hinn was born on [[December_3|3 December]] [[1952]] in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]], to [[Greece|Greek]] and [[Armenia|Armenian]] parents. He was raised within the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox Church]], and attended Georges Vanier High School in [[Toronto]], [[Canada]]. He asserts{{fact}} that as a child, he was socially isolated and handicapped by a severe stammer, but was nonetheless a first-class student, although this claim has been disputed by some of his critics.<ref>[http://www.trinityfi.org/press/heretic.html John Bloom, ''The Heretic'', D Magazine, August 2003.]</ref><br/>+<br/>+He has written that in December 1973 he travelled by charter bus from Toronto to [[Pittsburgh]] to attend a "miracle service" conducted by evangelist [[Kathryn Kuhlman]]. Although he never met her personally, he often attended her “healing services” and has often cited her as an influence in his life.{{fact}}<br/>+<br/>+He founded the [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] Christian Center in [[1983]]. During its heyday the church averaged over 10,000 in attendance. In 1999, he sold the church (by the time renamed to the World Outreach Center) to [[Clint Brown]] and moved to [[Grapevine, Texas]], a suburb of [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], while maintaining the legal entity “World Outreach Center Benny Hinn Ministries”.<br/>+<br/>+==Controversies==<br/>+At least one book, ''The Confusing World of Benny Hinn'' (ISBN 1-885591-94-2), published by [[Personal Freedom Outreach]] (PFO), is devoted solely to various issues surrounding Hinn and his ministry, and PFO's ''Quarterly Journal'' usually has at least one article devoted to the latest controversy surrounding Hinn. [[The Sword of the Lord]] also has a book for sale devoted to Hinn, and virtually every Christian counter-[[cult]], watchdog, and apologetics teacher and ministry has extensive information and critique of Hinn.<br/>+<br/>+As a proponent of Word of Faith doctrine, Hinn is subject to the criticisms that accompany the viewpoint. These include: unsound Biblical doctrine, exploitation of the poor, a heavy reliance on personal "health and wealth", and so on. Also, his support of faith healing brings the accompanying criticisms of that viewpoint. Allegedly, Hinn visits the grave of [[Kathryn Kuhlman]] to receive the "anointing" from God, as reported by [[Personal Freedom Outreach]], and has been accused of practising [[divination]].<br/>+<br/>+===Investigations===<br/>+In [[2000]], the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s (CBC) show ''Witness'' ran a two-part series about purported faith healers Benny Hinn and [[Reinhard Bonnke]].<br/>+<br/>+On [[November 3]], [[2004]], the CBC's ''[[the fifth estate]]'' ran an exposé on Benny Hinn, revealing reports of [[fraud|fraudulent activity]] on his part.<br/>+<br/>+''[[Dateline NBC]]'' also ran an [[Exposé (journalism)|exposé]] on Hinn in [[December 27]], [[2002]], and aired a follow-up investigation on [[March 6]], [[2005]], which alleged that Hinn lives a lavish lifestyle, that his ministry uses only a small percentage of its revenues for charitable purposes and that claims of successful faith healing are unsubstantiated and, in some cases, false. Hinn responded to the allegations in detail in a letter on [[March 10]], [[2004]]. The allegations, however, are hard to validate, since Hinn's ministry claims a church tax exemption, as opposed to a religious non-profit exemption, which exempts Hinn and his ministry from having to reveal financial records (see below regarding an investigation into such exemption). Hinn lives in an oceanfront [[hacienda]] in [[Dana Point, California]], valued at $8.5-million. <ref>http://www.nndb.com/people/605/000022539/</ref> <ref>http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=100+Ritz+Cove+Dr.+Dana+Point,+CA&ll=33.479169,-117.719847&spn=0.00417,0.010729&t=k&om=1</ref><br/>+<br/>+''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' reported in July 2005 that Hinn was being investigated by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] as to his ministry's tax exempt status, specifically its designation as a church. Under IRS regulations, non-profit organizations must file for a "letter of determination" as to tax-exempt status and annually report information as to donations, expenses and salaries. However, churches are specifically exempt from reporting requirements, and do not need to file for a letter of determination. They may simply claim tax-exempt status, which the IRS must then prove otherwise. <br/>+<br/>+The [[Trinity Foundation (Dallas)|Trinity Foundation]], a self-proclaimed "watchdog ministry" headed by [[Ole Anthony]], states that its investigation "proves" that Hinn's ministry does not meet IRS guidelines for church designation, specifically that Hinn does not conduct "regular public worship services" at his headquarters which Hinn lists as the church address; however, according to Anthony and Trinity Foundation access to the facility is highly restricted and not open to the public or at any other location that Anthony or Trinity Foundation have been able to determine.<br/>+<br/>+There is, in fact, a "World Healing Center Church" that operates in California under the leadership of Hinn's son-in-law Michael Koulianos and daughter Jessica.<br/>+<br/>+The ''[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]'' reported in August 2005 that the [[Tarrant County, Texas|Tarrant County Appraisal District]] (responsible for determining the assessed value of real estate for tax purposes and for granting property tax exemptions) was reviewing whether Hinn's facility in Grapevine met the requirements for a property tax exemption. Specifically, the review would focus on whether the "church" designation, the same one Anthony and Trinity Foundation claim is false, was used to claim an exemption to which Hinn's ministry may not have been entitled. The review was requested by Anthony and Trinity Foundation.<br/>+<br/>+Hinn's ministry has confirmed the validity of the reports regarding the IRS and Tarrant County reviews, but accused Trinity Foundation and Anthony of attempting to destroy "all Christian ministries in general" and specifically Hinn's.<br/>+<br/>+In January 2005, Hinn's ministry organized a trip to [[Bangalore]], [[India]], and a prayer meeting attended by various politicians and high profile people. [[Hinduism|Hindu]] groups objected to this stating that the meeting was a front for mass conversion by controversial means. The news website Rediff.com India reported: "Hinn claimed that he had cured several people of ailments with the blessings of [[Jesus Christ]], but hundreds of disabled and sick people returned disappointed, without getting any remedy." The report also mentions "A doctor, meanwhile, lodged a police complaint against Hinn and the organisers of the show, seeking action for what he said was the death of a man due to cardiac arrest after being pushed by Hinn on the stage on Saturday".<br/>+<br/>+==Claim of prophetic ability==<br/>+Benny Hinn claims to be a [[prophet]] of [[God]] and regularly issues specific prophecies regarding events that he claims will occur within specific periods of time. However, he has a documented history of making prophecies that have not come true (see below for a partial list). Since, according to the definition specified by the [[Bible]] that true prophets inspired by God can never be incorrect in their prophecies, many Christian apologetics ministries, primarily those who oppose the Word of Faith movement in general, consider Benny Hinn to be a [[false prophet]].<br/>+<br/>+===Examples of questionable prophecies===<br/>+*"The Spirit tells me - [[Fidel Castro]] will die - in the 90's. Oooh my! Some will try to kill him and they will not succeed. But there will come a change in his physical health, and he will not stay in power, and Cuba will be visited of God." <ref>http://www.sermonaudio.com/sermoninfo.asp?SID=420067844</ref><br/>+*"The Lord also tells me to tell you in the mid 90’s, about ’94-’95, no later than that, God will destroy the [[homosexual]] community of America.

Since there's only one Catholic girls school in Jerusalem, Schmidt's Girls College, it was a fairly easy matter to question all the nuns who were there in 1976, as well as Father Dusind, who has overseen all religious instruction since 1955. The result? "This is nonsense, real nonsense," Dusind told Fisher and Goedelman. "It never happened and could not happen because a Charismatic healer or Protestant preacher would never ever be let in to talk to the girls."<ref>[http://www.trinityfi.org/press/heretic.html John Bloom, ''The Heretic'', D Magazine, August 2003.]</ref><br/>+<br/>+*"The heavyweight boxer [[Evander Holyfield]], banned from boxing because of a heart condition, went to a Benny Hinn crusade in Philadelphia, had Hinn lay hands on him, and gave Hinn a check for $265,000 after he was told he was healed. In fact, he passed his next examination by the boxing commission, but later his doctors said he never had a heart condition in the first place – he had been misdiagnosed. But Hinn refused to give Holyfield his money back and threatened legal action if he told anyone the truth."<ref>ibid.</ref><br/>+<br/>+==Famous quotes and theological statements==<br/>+*"The reason people lose their healing is because they begin questioning if God really did it."<br/>+*"I don't need gold in heaven, I gotta have it now."

It is home to around 6000 inhabitants.<br/> <br/>-== Birth and Childhood ==<br/>-Phan Thi Mỹ Tâm was born on January 16, 1981 in the city of Da Nang.<br/>+[[Image:Gaelic~1.jpg|thumb|[[Ardoyne mural]] Gaelic games]]<br/> <br/>-== School Years ==<br/>-She graduated from a 4-year Intermediate level of Ho Chi Minh City Conservatory.<br/>+Republican paramilitary organisations have had a major influence in the area from the start of [[The Troubles]] in [[1969]]. There were many incidents involving these groups and both the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] and [[British Army]]. There has also been more wide spread conflict between this community and inhabitants from adjoining loyalist areas.<br/> <br/>-== News ==<br/>-'''Vietnamese pop singer My Tam joins Korea’s Asia Song Festival''' <br/>+The rise in popularity of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] and the [[Irish National Liberation Army]] led to more police raids in the area, supported on occasion by the British Army. [[Internment]] (imprisonment without trial) affected many in Ardoyne, which to this day remains a vocal point for Nationalists. Over the years after 1969, the area grew in membership for the Provisional IRA, so much that it became one of the "No go" areas, listed by the RUC and British Army, due to rising security risks and casualties suffered by the armed forces upon entering the district. A point can be made that the district has seen more than its fair share of the Troubles. The outskirts of Ardoyne have been scene to various encounters between Republicans (namely the Provisional IRA and, to a lesser extent, INLA) and the British Army during the Troubles. <br/> <br/>-Viet Nam pop star My Tam arrived in Seoul on Wednesday to take part in the first Asia Song Festival to be held from November 24-27, the singer’s manager told Viet Nam News on Tuesday.<br/>-My Tam will share the stage the evening of November 26 with other Asian pop singers and groups such as BoA and Lee Hyo Lee from the Republic of Korea, Ayumi Hamasaki from Japan, Sun Nan and Yang Kun from mainland China, Leon Lai from Hong Kong, F4 from Taiwan, and Palmy from Thailand.<br/>-The performance will take place at the Olympic Park, Songpa Gu, Seoul.<br/>+Ardoyne and the wider north and west Belfast area has an above average [[suicide]] rate in comparison to the rest of the [[United Kingdom|UK]].[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4489431.stm] Various factors have been blamed for the deaths, including unemployment, social depravation and intimidation of the areas youth by republican paramilitaries.<br/> <br/>-My Tam will perform two songs, Uoc Gi (I Wish) by Vietnamese composer Vo Thien Thanh and Nu Hon Bat Ngo (A Surprising Kiss) which she wrote herself.<br/>+==The Ardoyne Road==<br/>+Violence often occurs on the Ardoyne Road during the [[Orange Order|Orange Order's]] marching season. The road is an "interface area", where nationalist and [[Unionist (Ireland)|unionist]] communities meet. The local nationalist community oppose what they see as a triumphialist parade through their area, while marchers state their right to "walk the Queen's highway", along their traditional route.<br/> <br/>-Uoc Gi is a wildly popular song in Viet Nam and contributed to her latest album Yesterday and Now, selling out 60,000 copies in a few months.<br/>+The [[Parades Commission]] usually allow the march to take place. One particular cause of conflict is that in the past marchers have carried flags depicting [[Ulster Volunteer Force]] and [[Ulster Defense Association]] (paramilitary terrorist organisations) banners and played [[Ulster Loyalist|loyalist]] songs, often containg virulently anti-Catholic lyrics. Perhaps most controversial are the supporters of the march, who are allowed to follow the march as it goes along. These are people who are usually not members of the Orange Order. The [[2006]] march agreement however ensured that 'supporters' would not be allowed to march. <br/> <br/>-Nu Hon Bat Ngo debuted at her live show two months ago.<br/>+Residents on the opposite side of the Ardoyne Road are barricaded into their street by the police and British Army for several hours throughout the day, in the morning when the march goes by and in the evening when it returns, since there are only two exists from the estate. Local residents believe this to be a breach of their human rights.<br/> <br/>-My Tam will also join an off-stage performance with other festival participants on November 25 prior to the opening of the Asia Song Festival.<br/>+Unionists have highlighted the part republican organisations have played in protests including prominent convicted IRA men such as [[Sean Kelly (IRA bomber)|Sean Kelly]] who was arrested after violent protests during a parade.<br/> <br/>-The largest culture and music festival in Asia, the Asia Song Festival is sponsored by the Korea Foundation for Asian Culture Exchange and the Korea Broadcasting System (KBS).<br/>+Despite the local community group, the Ardoyne Parades Dialogue Group, and representatives of the march, the North and West Belfast Parades Forum, reaching an accommodation which imposed conditions on the march, golf balls and stones were thrown by a crowd being kept back by stewards. One woman, who had been part of the nationalist protest, was hit by a missile thrown by the crowd behind her [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/5089416.stm].<br/> <br/>-The festival is expected to draw an audience of about 10,000 people.<br/>-Festival performances will be broadcast on KBS in Korea, Japan’s NHK, mainland China’s BTV, Hong Kong’s ATV, Taiwan’s Eastern TV, Malaysia’s ASTRO, Thailand’s ThaiTV3, Viet Nam’s HTV and Singapore’s Channel U. — '''VNS '''<br/>+==Holy Cross dispute==<br/>+The most recent international exposure given to Ardoyne was in [[2001]]. Heightened sectarian violence was largely attributed to protests which saw children of the Holy Cross Girl's School, some as young as four years of age, denied access to one of the entrances to their school.<br/>+<br/>+:See ''[[Holy Cross dispute]]''<br/>+<br/>+[[Image:11gpo191~11.jpg|thumb|[[Ardoyne mural]] 1916 Rising.]]<br/>+<br/>+==Ardoyne's murals==<br/>+Belfast is filled with areas depicting many murals of various topics, most often about the paramilitary connections of the area which they appear in. Whilst Ardoyne has some murals of this type, it mainly has murals to depict history, Irish traditions and important dates in Irish history, such as the [[1916]] [[Easter Rising]] and the [[Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849)|Irish famine]]. Many foreign visitors find these murals to be impressive and believe that they add to the rich history of the area. Paramilitary banners often depict the [[1981 Irish Hunger Strike]], when ten Republican prisoners died from starvation during a protest to demand political status.<br/>+<br/>+==Ardoyne today==<br/>+Today Ardoyne has a local [[Gaelic Athletic Association|GAA]] sports club and is home to the annual "Ard Eoin Fleadh Cheoil" (Ardoyne Music Festival). The festival attracts some of the most famous [[Irish traditional music#Traditional music|Irish]] musical acts, including the [[Wolfe Tones]].<br/>+<br/>+Once labelled a "No go" area for the police, the community has become much more open that it was in the past. Road barriers are all but gone, and many would say the residents now live in a normal, working class community.<br/>+<br/>+[[Category:Geography of Belfast]]<br/>+<br/>+[[sv:Ardoyne]]</td>

It has nearly 140 references, is amazingly comprehensive when considering that this is the most influential video game of all time (but not the best!), and 80 percent of the work was done by Ryu; I only performed a light copyedit on this one. Speaking of copyedits, it might need a few more tweaks, but we'll leave that for you to determine. Additionally, I raised a few concerns with Ryu, and here was his reply:<br/>+{{busy|[[User:Bluemask|bluemask]]}}<br/> <br/>-:''Maybe it's because I'm too close to the subject (I wrote the entire article, and after almost 100kb, I guess that's inevitable XD), but I honestly can't see what we could lose from the Plot or Development sections. I mean, the thing is long as hell, yeah, but it does meet the FA criterion of staying tightly focused on the subject. Pesonally, I think if we shortened anything, we'd be losing that comprehensive overview.''<br/>+== Archives ==<br/>+* [[User talk:Bluemask/Archive 01]]<br/> <br/>-:''I mean, looking back through the various Plot sections, I don't see anything we can lose because it's either backstory vital to understanding the rest of it, subplots that have to be touched upon in order to meet comprehensive standards, character design info that we always include and shouldn't cut just on the basis of length (it's technically shorter than VIII's character section anyway), or the major revelations and resolutions of the storyline (and we're still ignoring ''how'' much? Rufus gets mentioned one time, we don't mention any specific Turks' names, "huge materia" doesn't pop up, nor does "Sister Ray" or "Northern Cave", Bugenhagen's name doesn't even appear outside of references, all the specifics of Barret, Red, Yuffie and Cid's stories don't even get touched on, etc.). I know there's a lot of content to the article, but there's a lot of content to the game, and we don't even make note of a lot of it. More than most of them have in all honesty.''<br/>+== Discussions ==<br/> <br/>-:''In the Development section, we're able to provide info on the software that was used in the game's development, how many people it took, how much money was spent, what prompted the leap into 3D, the initial 3D experiment (something that resulted in some criticism leveled at Square by gamers, which is mentioned later), the rationale behind some extremely notable decisions that have affected gaming ever since, the difficulties overcome in developing this groundbreaking game, and one of the most intensive marketing campaigns in the history of gaming. Again, I know we've got a lot of content, but this isn't an article about just any game. I know I'm sounding like a ''Final Fantasy VII'' zealot when I say that, but it's true. I might not personally worship the game, but it can't be denied its props. This is the World War II of video game articles. I mean, this really is the game that changed everything. Playing video games in the US was suddenly cool, "RPG" became a household name outside Japan, and you could say a game took 60 hours to finish to an awed audience instead of a jeering one.''<br/>+== Reference conversion ==<br/> <br/>-:''I know there are some people who will oppose on the basis of length alone, but we both know that's not a valid objection. They would have to explain how we got off the subject in the face of us knowing why the information is relevant and able to point it out. There are actually Featured Articles longer this one, such as [[World War I]], [[Polish-Soviet War]], [[Byzantine Empire]] and [[Theodore Roosevelt]].''<br/>-<br/>-:''I know you also have concerns about the References, but according to [[Wikipedia:Article size]], only the main body of prose is supposed to be counted. Reviewers aren't even supposed to look at the references beyond making sure that they're actually referencing what we claim they are.''<br/>-<br/>-:''I really feel like it deserves its place as FA like it stands right now. If FA isn't something an article can get just because somebody says "This comprehensive and informative article on a major subject takes me more than half a second to scroll the entire length... and I'm just too lazy to scroll any longer than that" then it's not an honor worth getting. I think we should try it before cutting anything, and only cut if they provide some darn good reasoning. I usually go with your advice, and I won't consider moving the article forward until you agree with me, but this time, I feel sure of our current standing. I really feel sure.

We felt that it made the most sense to discuss the ''Compilation'' within the article the project is based on, while providing links to the various titles that comprise it. You make a good point about the sequels. I meant to add mention of that into the lead and will do so now. Thank you for the reminder and general approval.

The article is long, yes.  But I can't say what should be cut.  There's just too much to cover- most of the sidestories are ignored or incredibly short as it is.  The only critism that I have is minor- In the very end of the Compilation section, second to last paragraph, that "however" doesn't make any sense, as it's supporting the previous sentence.

It sounds like you're saying that you're objecting based solely on the length alone, regardless of whether or not the length is needed. The category of the subject has no bearing on how many kbs are required to provide proper coverage of the subject. Some video games require more coverage than others, as some have more content than others or are more notable than others (this particular title falling into both categories). The [[Wikipedia:What is a featured article?|featured article criteria]] makes no mention of the "recommended length" thing. That's simply [[Wikipedia:Article size|a stylistic suggestion]], not an actual rule, and one that openly admits that there will be exceptions to how strictly it should be considered.

They're simply not credible "faults" and won't be recognized as such because they aren't part of criteria. In any event, why would examples of people not recognizing proper FAC procedure in other FACs have any bearing on this FAC — which ''should'' recognize FAC procedure?

Why is this image essential to understanding the article?<br/>-Apart from the problems with the images, the article seems to contain some original research (for example, who says "Themes of the game include environmental awareness, acceptance of self, and the nature of life, death and the spirit"? Is that the editor's own interpretation?) I notice a lot of the "references" are actually just quotes from the game, meaning primary rather than secondary sources are being used. That's not against policy, but it is discouraged, especially for claims that are open to more than one interpretation.

I appreciate the desire to properly and conclusively cite sources, but it seems a bit overcrowded and hard to read. Might both of these cases be properly cited with, say, no more than three footnotes each? Alternatively, if you feel that all of the sources are necessary, you might think of putting some of them into the markup, commented-out (<nowiki>"<!--</nowiki> Further details on such-and-such can be found in Authorname, <i>Book Title</i>, pages 10-12" and so on). [[User:Andrew Levine|Andrew Levine]] 21:34, 14 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-::'''Comment''' - It's fairly obvious that you never read the article before it was turned into an FAC.  As stated above, FF7 is ''the'' most cruft-attracting game ever.  For an article that has historicaly been a bloated plot summary to be submitted as a ~100kb FAC, there needs to be almost epic levels of referencing to show that that is not the case here.  I also disagree with putting references in markup- what's the point of references if you can't see them on the article itself? it defeats the purpose of having them in the first place.

Yes, it's big, but it never feels like a long read: everything is (despite first glance!) actually very lightly touched upon and straight-to-the-point, without any extra fluff.  It's very well written (although that pretty much [[User:Ryu Kaze|goes without saying]]...) and is unbelievably well-referenced.

[[User:Ryu Kaze|Ryu Kaze]] 13:02, 17 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-*'''Comment'''  As the principal contributer to a FA and a current FAC I fully understand the difficulty of keeping articles down in size. It bothers me slightly that you consider this ''isn't really an actionable objection'', it is actionable, it is simply very hard. Any FAC on a subject could theoretically be three times as long and still only cover a fraction of what there is to know about it, that is the essence of an encyclopedia article (as opposed to a book). The skill of the editor is whitteling down a huge body of facts into a succinct body of prose that covers the salient points. So here I am, wanting to support what is for the most part a ''very good article'' that falls down due to a lack of heavy red marker pen editing. The article does a good job of explaining the games importance (I LOVE it when articles explain real world importance), but the long story section is bloated and difficult to follow or remain interested in. It simply fails to be 'the best of Wikipedia's work'. I am holding off on actually objecting, I'd be interested to see the editors comments, and I would like to see this featured, I just don't think it is there yet. [[User:Sabine's Sunbird|Sabine's Sunbird]]  [[User talk:Sabine's Sunbird|talk]] 18:12, 15 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-**See, we're strongly opposed to being badgered between inclusionism and deletionism because we nearly lost a featured article last month because it ''didn't explain the story enough''. Heck, that article's story section is nearly as long as this one, and some editors felt it wasn't comprehensive ''enough''. RPGs are 40 hours long, and they have lenghty stories; to ignore major plot elements is not cutting fancruft, but failing to meet the comprehensiveness standard. Please understand that we're sick of the "too long" or "too short" games of monkey in the middle, and we try our hardest to reach middle ground so that we're not screwed by a faction. &mdash; '''[[User:Deckiller|Deckill]][[User:Deckiller/EA|<font color="green">e</font>]][[User talk:Deckiller|r]]''' 18:39, 15 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-***Well, I appreciate your comments and the fact that you asked for an explanation of length rather than outright opposed. I can also appreciate that you shot for explaining your concerns with the article rather than straight out labeling them grounds for objection. Now, to be entirely honest with you, working on the story section for this one was harder than those for [[Final Fantasy VI]], [[Final Fantasy VIII]], [[Final Fantasy X]], [[Final Fantasy X-2]], [[Chrono Trigger]] or [[Shadow of the Colossus]]. While ''Final Fantasy X'' has an unbelievably immense level of backstory, the main story that develops as you play is still relatively straightforward and — sticking to the main subplot, while briefly touching on the surrounding ones — can be done fairly easily. ''Final Fantasy VIII'' is a simple matter on both levels. ''VI'' and ''X-2'' are a little heavier on backstory than ''VIII'', but still nothing near ''X'' (obviously ''X'' itself serves as the backstory for ''X-2''), while having a main storyline that's quite straightforward. ''Chrono Trigger'' and ''Shadow'' have essentially no backstory, while ''Shadow'' is extremely straightforward in its main story. ''CT'', however, is pretty heavy on describing the actual developments of the story — mainly because, like ''VII'', each main character has their own subplot that has to be resolved during the game. Even so, it's still not on the same level of content as ''VII''.<br/>-<br/>-:::''VII'' has a ridiculus number of subplots that are introduced, developed, and resolved within the framework of the actual story. That's not even looking at the backstory, which — while not as immense as ''X''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s — is still pretty large. Unfortunately, also like ''X'', major aspects of the backstory are revealed during the development of the game itself (specifically Sephiroth and Cloud's histories, which also requires going into the history of Jenova and bringing up Professor Gast). That requires roughly four paragraphs within the story section right there. ''VII'' is notorious for being a game where things are not what they seem, full of plot twists, revelations and "Where did that come from?" moments. Since we're required to write about the stories of fictional works in the way that the story unfolds for the player in order to maintain a real world perspective, this means that the section is unavoidably going to be long.<br/>-:::I love succinct, crisp descriptions in an encyclopedia article as much as anyone, I promise. To ensure that this article was comprehensive (a standard of FAC that overshadows any concerns of length), it couldn't be short. However, that doesn't mean it isn't succint. As I said in the text Deckiller quoted when nominating the article, there is a whole lot that we're still not bringing up because it's not part of the core storyline. Comprehensiveness requires that we touch on the main characters' subplots and mention their resolutions, but we don't mention ''any'' of the development of those except with the core plot. To give you some examples of the things I didn't include for the sake of brevity, read this list:<br/>-::('''note to Raul:''' this is a list of examples of how we've maintained brevity with the story aspects of the article; you won't need to read each of these if you just want to cut to whatever response follows)<br/>-:::*A character named "Bugenhagen" lives at Cosmo Canyon. He's probably the most intelligent character in the entire game, with an extensive understanding of the planet and the Lifestream. He is, in fact, the character who first brings it up (it wasn't necessary to mention this, because Sephiroth's explanation of his plan is sufficient for emphasising the characters' understanding of the Lifestream). This character also pretty much raised Red XIII, and was the one who discovered that Aerith had been trying to cast Holy before she died and tells the others that Sephiroth must be blocking the spell from moving against Meteor. Before the end of the game, Bugenhagen dies from old age, being 130 years old. None of this is mentioned in such specifics.<br/>-:::*Rufus Shinra becomes the president of Shin-Ra after Sephiroth kills his father. This is mentioned. What isn't mentioned is that Rufus' philosophy for running the company was in stark contrast to his father's. Instead of running the world with money, he believed he could do it through fear. People in society consider him cold-hearted and he's infamous for looking down on others as stupid, because he's extremely clever himself. In a turn of striking irony, after Meteor is summoned and the WEAPONs awakened, he takes up the position of defending the world from despair himself, and it becomes apparent that he actually cares for his people. At one point, he tries having the members of AVALANCHE executed while telling the public that Meteor and the WEAPONs are their fault. Even though he expected the world was going to be destroyed anyway, he wanted the public to feel better, thinking that someone was responsible and was being punished. Before the end of the game, everyone believes he's dead, killed in an explosion caused by one of the WEAPONs. He survived, though, and shows up alive in ''Advent Children''. Obviously not all of this is mentioned.<br/>-:::*Sephiroth cast Meteor in the crater where Jenova had landed. This crater caved in when he cast the spell and the WEAPONs awakened, revealing that the planet underneath had been hurt drastically because of Jenova. There was a chasm leading all the way to the planet's core. It is through this chasm that the heroes travel at the end of the game, but they can't do it right away because Sephiroth erected a magical barrier over it after casting Meteor. In order to penetrate this barrier, Shin-Ra moves a gigantic cannon from their military base to Midgar, hooks it up to all the mako reactors in the city, and fires a beam of pure mako at the barrier. In the meantime, one of the WEAPONs shoots at Midgar. The beam from the cannon cuts through the WEAPON, killing it, while its attack hits Rufus' office, apparently killing him. The mako beam keeps going, hits Sephiroth's barrier, breaks it, and then gives the heroes the opportunity to go after Sephiroth. Before they can, however, Hojo takes over the cannon and tries shooting at the crater again, intending to send the Lifestream's power directly to Sephiroth. The heroes go after him, and it's then that we learn that Hojo is Sephiroth's father. More stuff we don't specify.<br/>-:::*There's four members of the Turks unit seen in the game. They're extremely popular characters, but we don't mention even their names (I was hoping the fact that they got their own game — as mentioned in the ''Compilation'' section — would emphasise that well enough). We don't mention that Reno (probably the most popular Turk) is the one who was ordered to destroy Sector 7. We also don't mention that Don Corneo shows up again during Yuffie's subplot, kidnaps Yuffie and Elena (one of the Turks), and that AVALANCHE and the Turks form a begruding respect for one another while working together to free their comrades. As a result of this team-up, near the end of the game, the player is given the option of not fighting the group. In ''Advent Children'', their respect for one another is still there, and they help each other out.<br/>-:::*Cid gets to fulfill his dream of going into space when Shin-Ra tries using the rocket from years earlier to send a materia bomb into Meteor. It's during this scenario that we learn that the assistant he had been verbally abusing for years saved his life. She had been examining an oxygen tank she wasn't comfortable with when it was almost time to launch the rocket. She said she'd stay in the room and die to make sure that Cid got to have his dream, but he wasn't willing to kill someone to go into space, so he stopped the launch. When Shin-Ra sends the rocket up, AVALANCHE is onboard, and as Cid runs past the oxygen tank that his assistant had been examining years earlier, it explodes, trapping him under some rubble. He then realizes that she had been right about it, and later apologizes to her.<br/>-:::*Yuffie fights her father and several important people from Wutai, earning the right to carry the sacred Leviathan materia. It's also at this time that she and her father's disputes are settled when she learns why he hadn't fought back against Shin-Ra.<br/>-:::*There's still a lot more I haven't gotten into.<br/>-<br/>-:::As Deckiller explained, we seek to establish a compromise between the inclusionist and deletionist philosophies, because we don't want to be caught in the middle while they feud, wanting ''our'' work to be used as an example in their ideal wars. It's happened to us before and we nearly lost an FA over it. We've had to explain that there's no standard for length except succinct comprehensiveness (not an oxymoron, as some have argued). Sometimes more coverage is required because there's more content, but even when that's true, we shoot for brevity. I believe the mark has been hit in this case. [[User:Ryu Kaze|Ryu Kaze]] 19:27, 15 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-::'''Reply'''. I see. ''He who sits in the middle of the road gets hit on both sides'' as my grandmother once warned me. I didn't realise that people were demanding longer story sections. Okay, your explanation makes sense to a point - I did appreciate that the length of the RPG meant that it was difficult to condense. Please be aware that what I was advocating was not deletionism - I'm a lumper/splitter, and I was reasoning that there was scope to move large sections to their respective subpages and place briefer summaries in their place here. Ultimately I still feel that is both possible and preferable, but I conceed that I a) don't know the subject well enough to make definitive statements on that and b) the cut off point between too long and too short is subjective. It may indeed be impossible. <br/>-::So I shall not be objecting. I haven't made my mind up about supporting it yet either.

It's somewhat laughable that it's even part of copyright law since you don't know how it will be defined until you're already in court. Though my commentary is probably more fit for a discussion of US copyright law than anything else, so I'll stop with this closing statement: fair-use is a wonderful concept, but implemented somewhat poorly (note: this is not a negative criticique of how Wikipedia handles fair-use, just so no one takes it that way; it's just commentary on fair-use in general).

I have a couple of things I'd like to comment on, although since I'm working on another article I'm restricting my comments to the first couple of sections:<br/>-**"console and computer role-playin game"? Again, I feel that console role-playing games (also known as Japanese role-playing games) and computer role-playing games (Western role-playing games) are genre distinctions, not platform. Of course, ''Final Fantasy VII'' would fall under [[console role-playing game]].<br/>-**I don't see the purpose of wikilinking some of the dates. [[2000s]]?<br/>-**"often credited"? How about just "credited"? Less verbosity and one less peacock term. I would probably revise the sentence to read something shorter and less awkward like "...is credited with bringing mainstream success to console role-playing games." "Out of Japan" is unnecessary; the implication of ''mainstream'' is enough.<br/>-**"As with the preceding games in the series, the world map may be traversed by foot, by chocobo, by airship, or by other means of transportation." I would replace "may be" with "is."<br/>-**"At other times, pre-rendered cinematic cut scenes progress the story." Consider replacing "progress" with "advance." I think "advance" suits the context slightly better and "progression" is used in the same paragraph (thus, "advanced" won't sound as repetitive").<br/>-**"During its turn-based battle sequences, the game uses the same Active Time Battle (ATB) system used in the three Final Fantasy games preceding it." Occurrences of "uses" and "used" very close to each other. "Utiliized" is overboard, so perhaps "...''featured'' in the three ''preceding'' Final Fantasy games."<br/>-**"Unlike previous games in the series, which traditionally allowed 4-5 playable characters to participate in battle, Final Fantasy VII allows for only three characters to be present in the party at any one time." The previous games in the series still (presently) allow for 4-5 playable characters (although ''Final Fantasy IV'' was the only to allow for five).<br/>-**"Final Fantasy VII's skill system has been described as a combination of the character class system used in Final Fantasy V and the accessory system seen in Final Fantasy VI." "Has been described"? Sounds a bit weasel-wordish.<br/>-That's all I have for now. This article is truly amazing; the only criticisms I could come up with were nit-picks. Again, excellent job. :) --[[User:Tristam|Tristam]] 05:01, 16 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-**I took a lot of these into consideration during a light copyedit, although the "can be" wording is intentional, since chocobos aren't mandatory (and adding a whole sentence describing that would be redundant). &mdash; '''[[User:Deckiller|Deckill]][[User:Deckiller/EA|<font color="green">e</font>]][[User talk:Deckiller|r]]''' 06:19, 16 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-* I'd like to apologize if I seem a little overly frank for this FAC (and my community work in general); with lots of FA pushes comes lots of mirrored objections, so we tend to grow impatient as editors, which leads to attempts to "nip things in the bud", which can often come across as confrontational. &mdash; '''[[User:Deckiller|Deckill]][[User:Deckiller/EA|<font color="green">e</font>]][[User talk:Deckiller|r]]''' 06:49, 16 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-**Thanks for your input, Tristam, and your support.

This article has a sort of special place in my heart because it was one of my first edits while I was still known as a bunch of numbers separated by periods. Coming from someone who's played the game inside and out, I would say that the story section is barebones, absolutely as thin as it can get without slipping over a vital plot point. As Ryu Kaze has pointed out, there are plenty of things that seem just as important to understanding the story but have been completely glossed over for the sake of succinctness. I bet some FFVII fanboy out there will vandalize the story section by adding all of these things, rather than deleting.

I'd like to reinforce the fact that this is already a summarized portion of the story, and further summarization will lead to issues coming from the other side. We struck a balance. &mdash; '''[[User:Deckiller|Deckill]][[User:Deckiller/EA|<font color="green">e</font>]][[User talk:Deckiller|r]]''' 05:55, 17 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-*<s>'''Oppose'''</s> - This article is [[Wikipedia:Article size|unreadable]]. I consider FFVII to be among the best video games in history and I really wanted to read this entire article in order to give a thoughout evaluation. However, my sincere desire to read the entire article was defeated once I got to the Story section. This section is just much too long. Trying to review every significant point in the story is just too tedious. The full story should be moved to a separate article and a summarized version added to the main article. The summary should be 5 or 6 paragraphs at the most (the same length as the other sections). The Compilation of Final Fantasy VII section should also be moved to a separate article (as has been suggested already). The Development section is also on the long side, though perhaps it could just be edited down a bit. The writing style and referencing are excellent and I would certainly support this article's nomination if I could just read the whole thing. [[User:Kaldari|Kaldari]] 06:08, 17 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-**Kaldari, comprehensivess is a [[Wikipedia:What is a featured article?|criterion for featured articles]]. Length is not. Did you read the above discussion about this issue? The only requirement related to length for featured articles is that they stay on the subject while ''first'' achieving comprehensiveness. As you can see detailed above, ''a lot'' of the story has still been left out, though I'm sure you know this anyway since you've indicated that you've played the game.<br/>-<br/>-::You said "The summary should be 5 or 6 paragraphs at the most" because other sections are that long. That doesn't make sense to me at all. There's more content here than with other stories and the other sections of the article. You can't impose a standard size on something that has no standard quantity of content to begin with. Were the section to be shortened as you've suggested here, someone could object (rightfully so) on the grounds that the much more important requirement of comrephensiveness has not been met, if not on the grounds that the story summary would be incomprehensible (remember, game stories have to be summarized in the order that the information is presented to us in the real world; trying to omit info under these circumstances would make it impenetrable to an outside reader). What's the point in a reader even starting to read the article if it's not going to be comprehensive or make sense? Again, comprehensiveness comes first.<br/>-<br/>-::[[Wikipedia:Article size]] is just a suggestion. It's not even part of the [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style|manual of style]]. It is, in fact, a suggestion that openly and readily admits that there will be exceptions to how strongly it should be considered with specific subjects (from the page: "''Sometimes an article simply needs to be big to give the subject adequate coverage; certainly, size is no reason to remove valid and useful information''"). It acknowledges that how long an article should be is a case-by-case matter. Why are you citing it in your objection when it doesn't even suggest that there should be a strictly followed standard of length?<br/>-<br/>-::For that matter, the manual of style only suggests that story summaries be kept "reasonably short". How can someone put down a universal definition of what is "reasonably short" when not every story has the same amount of content? ''Final Fantasy VII'' probably has more content than any of the others, and for reasons, explained above, it ''is'' being reasonably short. There's a ton of things that don't get in-depth coverage because the focus here is on the ''core'' storyline, with only the briefest mention of subplots. I am absolutely flabbergasted that someone who has played the game would suggest that ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'' — the ''Final Fantasy'' game that probably has more content to its storyline than any of the others — should have a shorter story section than the articles on ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'' or ''[[Final Fantasy X-2]]''. ''[[Chrono Trigger]]'' — another game with a lot of content — has a story section that rivals this one. If this article was about ''[[Shadow of the Colossus]]'' — an excercise in the concept of minimalistic storytelling — I would agree that 5 paragraphs are sufficient. But you can't suggest that a game designed to be completed in 10 to 12 hours with an intentionally minimalistic storyline should have the same summary size as a game designed to be completed in 50 or more hours, with a storyline that to this day is considered one of the most long-winded and convoluted outings in RPGs.<br/>-<br/>-::I feel inclined to ask if you considered the subject of the article when you made that suggestion. If so, you didn't add any mention of it to your claim. An argument for why the story section should be shorter than it is should be based on the story itself and why it doesn't require this kind of coverage — as well as how this kind of coverage could be avoided while being comprehensive and ensuring that the information makes sense — while hopefully taking into account that this is the article for the most revolutionary title in video game history. Why should it have a shorter story section than its successors?<br/>-<br/>-::By the way, the ''Compilation'' section would be a stub if it were an article to itself. That not only would result in ignoring coverage of this ''very'' notable aspect of this ''very'' notable game, but it would be placing that information into a spot where it wouldn't be so likely to get proper coverage. Outside of the article for Final Fantasy VII, a ''Compilation'' section isn't going to serve a purpose much greater than being a link repository. It's actually very relevant to the subject being discussed in this article, and should be described here.<br/>-<br/>-::Thanks for the compliment about writing style and referencing, though. Sorry if I was harsh in there at any point. I was just ''really'' floored by the suggestion you made and that you objected on such a basis. [[User:Ryu Kaze|Ryu Kaze]] 13:13, 17 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-:::Yes, I have read the entire FAC debate as well as much of the discussion on the article's talk page. I am still very firm in my belief that the story section is too long. I know that the article length guidelines are only suggestions. However, I believe that having a section that is so tedious as to be unreadable is certainly objectionable. I've read 1,000 page books, but I couldn't read this encyclopedia article because it was too tedious (despite the fact that I'm a huge fan of the game, no less). To me that is a huge problem. Please explain to me why it would be a problem to summarize the story? Obviously it is already summarized, I just think it needs to be summarized a lot more. I don't think that would prohibit the article from being comprehensive. [[User:Kaldari|Kaldari]] 21:09, 18 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-::::Well, I'm sorry you found the section tedious. I will scan the section again tonight and see if there's anything at all that could possibly be condensed, but I'm not expecting to be able to condense much. Even sticking to the core storyline, there's so much that has to be mentioned for the summary to make sense and be comprehensive too. But I will try. [[User:Ryu Kaze|Ryu Kaze]] 21:39, 18 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-:::::Ah, so the entire oppose boils down to finding the content dry? &mdash; '''[[User:Deckiller|Deckill]][[User:Deckiller/EA|<font color="green">e</font>]][[User talk:Deckiller|r]]''' 21:43, 18 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-::::::No, tedious is not the same thing as dry. All that I'm asking is that you limit the Story section to ''only'' the core storyline and that you remove any extraneous details not essential to the story. Considering how complex the core story is, perhaps it is not possible to adequately summarize it in 6 paragraphs. However, I do think the section can successfully be edited down more with some effort. [[User:Kaldari|Kaldari]] 19:02, 19 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-:::I'm sorry, Kaldari, but I've gone back through the Story section and I honestly can't see any way of making it shorter while preserving comprehensive requirements and the out-of-universe perspective that is also required. The only way it could be done would be to place the backstory info about Jenova's landing and defeat in the Setting section, as well as the info on Sephiroth's pre-birth enhancement, but I can't do that because we're required to present information like this in the order it's presented in-game. Since these are ''very'' important aspect of how the story unfolds, I ''can't'' move that information to the Setting section. If you must object, you just must. <s>I cannot and will not compromise the integirty of the article — in a way that guarantees it merit objections, no less — for the sake of it being called "too long" on the basis of only "I got bored while reading it".</s><br/>-<br/>-:::That seems to be more an issue of you and the content finding yourselves incompatible (or perhaps you and this particular means of presenting the content finding yourselves incompatible; you did say you played and liked the game itself). One might as well object to [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s FA status on the basis of "I got bored while reading the Assistant Secretary of the Navy section". You didn't explain to me why you believed the section was too long on the basis of the ''content itself''. You just said you got bored. I don't see how that provides me with any constructive input, or even a basis for shortening it in the event it was too long. [[User:Ryu Kaze|Ryu Kaze]] 22:31, 18 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-::::I find it disappointing that you would rather blame the reader than work on fixing the problem. There are plenty of areas in which the story section could be edited down without removing any vital plot informtion. I'll edit the section to give you a couple of examples. [[User:Kaldari|Kaldari]] 18:14, 19 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-:::While I personally think that the article is now lacking a bit, I can accept the changes you made as long as the line "As the journey progresses, each member of the group must come to terms with personal conflicts from their past" remains. So long as that line is there, I at least feel like the article is making the attempt to acknowledge those subplots. Does this satisfy your concerns with the article? [[User:Ryu Kaze|Ryu Kaze]] 01:35, 20 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-::::By the way, I trimmed the last bit of supporting cast subplot info that you missed, just so it remains consistently on the core characters. [[User:Ryu Kaze|Ryu Kaze]] 01:40, 20 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-:::::Although I still feel like the overall writing style of the Story section is too detailed, I'll give you credit for making a good faith effort (the first actual edit I've seen to address the issue, however timidly). So long as the Story section is restricted to the main storyline, I'll withdraw my opposition. Other than that issue, I think this is actually a very well done article. The references especially are extensive and I love the dialog citations from the game. There are a couple of awkward sentences, but I'll fix them myself if I can find them again. BTW, I only went through the first 4 paragraphs of the Story section to look for things to cut as an example, so I may still find some things to cut in the rest of it if I get around to editing the article again. I hope you've found my edits so far at least somewhat helpful. Good luck on the FAC nomination. [[User:Kaldari|Kaldari]] 05:24, 20 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-::::::Thank you very much, Kaldari. I can acknowledge that your edits were helpful, yes. I fear we might get some flack from those who feel a little more detailis needed for the other subplots, but now that an even greater effort has been made to strike a balance, I hope that everyone will agree that most of what could be done has been done. Thanks again. [[User:Ryu Kaze|Ryu Kaze]] 13:14, 20 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-*'''Comment''' Thanks for the changes you've made. I still can't support, but I can object less strongly than before. I'm still not seeing any discussion of "the game's distinctive art style" mentioned in every fair-use rationale. (''Is'' the art style really that distinctive? I'm no expert, but to me it looks like every other manga/anime out there.) And I'm still not convinced that most of these images are showing important aspects of the game in a way a text description would be unable to, but I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree on that. [[User:Angr]] 11:08, 17 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-**Within the ''Final Fantasy'' series, it most definitely has a distinct art style. Though Tetsuya Nomura did the designs for ''VIII'', ''X'', and ''X-2'' afterward, there were some major differences in the level of detail incorporated and even the anatomy represented (particularly with the characters' feet). It's mentioned in the Characters section, I believe, that Nomura said the game's graphical limitations caused him to restrict his actual style, making the designs a lot plainer. In an interview about the development of the next game, the art director, Yusuke Naora, said "This is how [Nomura] really draws". Thanks for returning, by the way. [[User:Ryu Kaze|Ryu Kaze]] 12:39, 17 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-***By the way, I've expaneded the fair-use rationale for the images. Give it a look if you would, please.

In any event, a lack of spoiler tags is not grounds for opposing an FA nomination. We're not required to warn people about plot details in articles. Not only is it not part of the [[Wikipedia:Manual of style|manual of style]], but readers are supposed to assume that any article may contain them without them being singled out, as mentioned in [[Wikipedia:Content disclaimer|the encyclopedia-wide notice accessible from the bottom of every page]]. [[User:Ryu Kaze|Ryu Kaze]] 03:41, 19 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-::*Not to be rude or anything, but why on earth would anyone read an encyclopedia article on a game, an article that claims to cover the whole game and all of the important details, and be surprised when some of those details turn out to be major plot points, in a section called "plot"?  Not only that, but if you've never played the game at all, even things like the names of characters would be spoilers.  What's more, for someone who (on the talk page) claims to have played FFs 1-6 and 8, and can therefore be called somewhat  of a final fantasy fanboy, to not know that Aeris was killed, 9 years ago in fact, is a bit odd. In short, your object vote isn't basd on anything that can really be used as the basis for a vote, and the fact that you honestly expected the article to not say anything at all about the plot at all is shocking. --[[User:PresN|PresN]] 05:17, 19 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-:::*Hi, it's me again. I'd like to point out a few things before you guys continue to bash me. '''1)''' First things first. You might be thinking that I'm just some anonymous guy making all this stuff up because I have something personal against the article writer and don't want the article to be featured. Well, let me tell you a few things. '''a)''' I have no idea who wrote it and I really don't mind. I really like Wikipedia and I read it quite a lot. If someone ever did such thing just to prevent an article to be featured in an online encyclopedia, that person would clearly have some serious problems. It's not the case with me. '''In fact, I really don't care if this article becomes featured or not. Therefore, if you want, don't even count my "OPPOSE" vote. However, all I want is for you to at least CONSIDER the problem I had.''' '''b)''' Why am I anonymous? Well, because I'm not a member. And why am I not a member? Because, frankly, I don't think I could contribute with much (if not anything), really. Maybe only some stuff in the article about Uruguay (country where I live) and some other Uruguayan culture stuff. '''c)''' Ok I know. So you're wondering why, not being a member, I have the knowledge of how to edit stuff, and even add '''bold text'''!! (OMG!!) Well, first, I know basic HTML (I know this is not HTML but knowing how to use tags and stuff helped me here), and I can handle all this stuff with ease. Second, I'm a member of Uncyclopedia, so I learned how the Wikipedia tags and stuff work there. The only major contribution I made in Uncyclopedia in the 3 or 4 months I've been a member is in the Uruguay article. IF you want, here's the link to my user page there, which is pretty damn blank: http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/User:Magellan '''2)''' About coming here. Well I have no idea why I came - I guess I just wanted to check out the Wikipedia article of FF7. Like I already said, I really like Wikipedia and I read it a lot. However, when I came to this article, I knew it would have spoilers. I AVOIDED the parts that say "Plot" and "Story". I actually scrolled down so fast that I missed the screenshot of Sephiroth killing Aeries. However, when I was reading the Legacy (that part interested me, I wanted to read about the criticism), I saw the spoiler. And it sucked. '''Note:''' I don't think that knowing the names of the characters is a spoiler. But knowing that they die is. Let me tell you, I already knew stuff such as, for example, that Sephiroth is that last boss. I don't think that's much of a big deal. I have many friends who played FF7 and they would always tell me "Hey man you gotta play it, it rules". And I even saw one of them playing once. They'd tell me some cool stuff about the gameplay and the story but always VAGUE - like a synopsis. They never told me "Hey man, you know that girl from the intro cut scene? The first character to appear in the game? SHE DIES!". '''3)''' I'm 18 years old and I really DID play FF 1-6 and 8. The first one on a real NES (which I still have, along with the original FF cartridge), which used to belong to my older brother. I played ALL OTHERS on a zSNES emulator (except 8, of course). I played the PC version of FF8 (in Spanish, because I couldn't find it in English)... You can tell that I'm not a very big fan of video game consoles - I just use the PC for everything. So the reason why I had never played FF7 before is pretty simple - I just never got the chance to do so. And I never really worried about playing it. I really like the FF series A LOT, but I don't consider myself a FAANNNNN, you know what I mean? Anyway, some months ago, my older bolder (who lives in London) came down to South America and gave me ALL his games. FF7 pc-version was one of them. And I decided to start it, so I could finally get to play it. '''<<<>>>''' That's all. Happy now? I couldn't have given more detail. Anyway, let me say what I came here to say: please add a spoiler tag or two. It doesn't hurt anyone. This article spoiled the game for me. It's just the right thing to do. Add one at "story" and another at "legacy" or something. ...

As there are different monitor sizes with different screen resolutions using different internet browsers, how images appear on one person's screen aren't necessarily going to match how they appear on someone else's. I'm not sure how the inclusion of the forced break altered the layout on your screen, but on mine it produced [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:WhitegaponFFVIIpage.JPG a very unsightly white gap]. Where use of a forced break won't necessarily benefit all monitors/resolutions/browsers, they're not supposed to be included. Instead, any and all other avenues are supposed to be pursued. I've moved the field map image up now (after removing the forced break), so hopefully that will make things look a little better. I know moving the image into the first paragraph can produce problems as well, but hopefully since the thumbnail is small, it won't. [[User:Ryu Kaze|Ryu Kaze]] 17:35, 20 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-:::The problem seems to have fixed now, but another occured.  The combat picture is now forcing the header "Plot" towards the right.  I know it does not happen in smaller screens but it is still a little odd.  I try not to add a forced break here (where it seems to be fine since it is the end of a section) and moved the picture up instead.

After that, I would give it a 2 out of a 10. I've read the arguments in pro and against adding spoiler tags, and I found that the arguments against are mostly CHILDISH. I am not going to be part of a edit war on this, but I a "highly active" wikipedia editor, I want to make sure that I express my voice on this. I might sound a bit harsh on the "giving 2 out of a 10" thing, but no matter how good is this article, it spoiled my gameplay and further interest in the game -- and I know that I am not alone on this as I have seen other users complaining about the same. Consider this analogy: I feel that this article is as deceptive as having a date with [[Irina Voronina]] and finding out way to late that she is a [[she-male]].

Although the boundaries of this term are still being defined, the Sloan article provides a very useful start.

[[User:mtoffel| mtoffel]] <small>'''Note:''' First edit from this user</small><br/>-**'''comment''' I find myself amused that the aformentioned google test by presumably a Enterprise 2.0 supporter appears to forget good google practice.

Sadly these results are by no means authoritative, as there is no simple means to filter out the use of this term within forums (which wikipedia should not use as a reference, hence making their inclusion in a google test a bad idea), as forums are part of this concept.

I would hope the fervor created by the deletion over the last few weeks would be indicative of the potential importance of this term. This is an evolving concept (as is Web 2.0) so it would be unfair to imply that the litmus test is a tried and true, uniform, definition. We don't worry about having one unified definition for concepts like "Faith" or "God" or "Love", and this is far more tangible and will find its way to a more universally accepted definition as we prove this out.

[[User:David Terrar|David Terrar]] 02:50, 25 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-* '''Do Not Delete''' - More than worthy of discussion, as one time's neologism is not necessarily the future.  I believe it takes domain expertise to understand the importance of this term and how it is being used in academia and industry.  There is going to be risk of sock puppeting in this conversation, because the domain experts are highly connected through blogging and other networks.  This isn't necessarily bad, as even Wikipedia forks content from conversation within the tool, previously on mailing lists and now on IRC (nor is it sock puppeting as most of the calls for participating are to expand the article).  The article itself has great potential for expansion, use of the term is clearly on the rise, and it will be problematic to co-mingle it with consumer articles like [[web 2.0]], [[social software]], [[social computing]], [[enterprise software]], [[architecture of participation]], [[wiki]] and more.

[[User:LinaMishima|LinaMishima]] 04:04, 25 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-*'''Delete'''. While I can respect the feelings that some editors have on this article, the fact of the matter is that this AfD is not about censorship or picking favorites or saying the term isn't used. It isn't about if the term has a huge following or not.  <b>It is about if the Article can pass all of Wikipedia's rules.</b>  Let me help out a bit so you understand.  The Google searchs are really only used to back up a statement, not as a stand-alone basis for a vote though this is abused sometimes. The problem with the google searches are that they also include blogs, forums, and other links that are not accepted by wikipedia's policies as sources (and quite a few users forget to do quotation marks around the words to make sure it is a focused search for that exact term).  The real problem with this article is that it doesn't follow the three pillars of wikipedia. An article must be [[WP:V|Verifiable]] through multiple, reliable, reputable, independent, third-party sources. It must not be [[WP:OR|original research]], which means there are no sources to back up the claims of the author(s).  It must also have a [[WP:NPOV|neutral point-of-view]] and not show bias. As a guideline for the above rules, an article must [[WP:CITE|cite it's notability]] with [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] and be must be [[WP:ENC|encyclopaedic]]. This article fails to meet [[WP:V]], some sections of [[WP:OR]], does not follow the guideline of [[WP:CITE]] or [[WP:RS]]. The biggest violation beyond not citing reliable sources, is [[WP:NEO|neologism]]. ''The first is that Wikipedia is not a dictionary, and so articles simply attempting to define a neologism are inappropriate''  and ''The second reason is that articles on neologisms frequently attempt to track the emergence and use of the term as observed in communities of interest or on the internet — without attributing these claims to reliable secondary sources. If the article is not verifiable (see Reliable sources for neologisms, below) then it constitutes analysis, synthesis and original research and consequently cannot be accepted by Wikipedia. This is true even though there may be many examples of the term in use.''.  Following this, ''Support for article contents, including the use and meaning of neologisms, must come from [[WP:RS|reliable sources]]. Wikipedia is a tertiary source that includes material on the basis of <b>verifiability, not truth.</b> To support the use of (or an article about) a particular term we must cite reliable secondary sources such as books and papers <B>about the term — not books and papers that use the term</b>.''.  So far no one has shown that there are reliable secondary sources that fit this criteria for this article. More over '' Neologisms that are in wide use — but for which there are no treatments in secondary sources — are not yet ready for use and coverage in Wikipedia. They may be in time, but not yet. The term does not need to be in Wikipedia in order to be a "true" term, and when secondary sources become available it will be appropriate to create an article on the topic or use the term within other articles.'' So when the time comes that this term does have citations that rely on books and papers that have articles/sections about the term, then the article can be recreate. As far as personal thoughts, ''An editor's personal observations and research (e.g. finding blogs and books that use the term) are insufficient to support use of (or articles on) neologisms because this is analysis and synthesis of primary source material (which is explicitly prohibited by the original research policy). To paraphrase [[WP:OR|Wikipedia:No original research]]: If you have research to support the inclusion of a term in the corpus of knowledge that is Wikipedia, the best approach is to arrange to have your results published in a peer-reviewed journal or reputable news outlet and then document your work in an appropriately non-partisan manner.''  I hope this helps understand my take on this discussion.--[[User:Bschott|<font color="Purple">Brian</font>]] <sup>([[User_talk:Bschott|<font color="orange">How am I doing?</font>]])</sup> 04:57, 25 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-**'''Comment'''. Brian, I appreciate the detailed view and, in terms of the letter of the Wiki law, I can't argue with many of your assertions. But the struggle I have broadly is that I could personally find you hundreds of wiki entries that are active and not subject to deletion which violate these very same "rules." Wiki is resplendent with neologisms of, frankly, far less import. There are even dozens of slang terms (including Booya! for goodness sake), which are allowed; yet Enterprise 2.0 which clearly has a following and an emerging interest can't pass muster? Wiki submission rules shouldn't be so complicated, is there somewhere I can read about the decision to create such rigid submission rules? [[User:Wood83|Wood83]]<br/>-***'''Reply''' Wood83, while I understand your thoughts, the arguement 'Because of Article X, then Article Y..' does not work here. Yes there are hundreds of articles that do not follow wikipedia's rules and as you see by the AfD logs, by the end of the day, dozens are removed. The thing is, nothing states that if I 'vote' delete on this afd, that I have to go out and make an AfD for all the other articles like this that fail any of the rules. If you found some, then by all means, make and afd for them! They are most likely subjects for deletion, yet no one has taken the time to start an AfD on them. The problem is that some of those slang terms that you have found do pass [[WP:V]] and [[WP:NEO]]...Enterprise 2.0 does not as of now. Yes, wikipedia has strict rules reguarding articles and they are all easily found. The talk pages for those rules are the best place to start.

[[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 17:47, 25 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-*'''Comment:  Original Research, Sources, and Verifiability.'''  I am the author of the ''Sloan Management Review'' (SMR) article referenced in the current WP entry on Enterprise 2.0.  I hope that this entry is not deleted, and I'd like to address the arguments mounted here for doing so.  <br/>-It is true that Enterprise 2.0 has become a marketing buzzword, but it did not start that way.  My article was the first use of the term (aside, I believe, from a single Technorati tag), so the term originated in an acceptable secondary source (as discussed more below), not in a marketing brainstorming session.  It subsequently become a buzzword because of its resonance and popularity in some quarters, but the same is true of 'Web 2.0' and 'disruptive technology,' both of which have long WP entries not currently flagged for deletion.<br/>-<br/>-It is also  true that Enterprise 2.0 is a neologism, as are Web 2.0, grid computing, and Web Services, all of which have WP entries.  WP's guideline on this seems quite clear:  "If the article is not verifiable (see Reliable sources for neologisms, below) then it constitutes analysis, synthesis and original research and consequently cannot be accepted by Wikipedia... Support for article contents, including the use and meaning of neologisms, must come from reliable sources. Wikipedia is a tertiary source that includes material on the basis of verifiability, not truth. To support the use of (or an article about) a particular term we must cite reliable secondary sources such as books and papers about the term — not books and papers that use the term."  <br/>-<br/>-My SMR article (which is clearly referenced in the current entry) was entirely devoted to explaining what the term meant.  SMR is a well-regarded and peer-reviewed journal, intended for both practitioners and academics.  It seems to easily meet WP's criteria for appropriate sources, and for verifiability:  "One of the keys to writing good encyclopedia articles is to understand that they must refer only to facts, assertions, theories, ideas, claims, opinions, and arguments that have already been published by reputable publishers."  "Reputable publications include peer-reviewed journals..." "The goal of Wikipedia is to become a complete and reliable encyclopedia. Editors should cite reliable sources so that their edits may be verified by readers and other editors."  It seems to me that the current entry does exactly this; anyone who wanted to could verify both the existence and content of the SMR article.  I appreciate that this article is not freely available on the Web, but I don't see anywhere that verifiability must stem from free, universally available, or copyright-free sources.  At any rate, an abstract of the article is available here: http://sloanreview.mit.edu/smr/issue/2006/spring/06/.  Other sources include the numerous blogs, my own included, listed in the current entry, as well as stories in Business Week (http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/jun2006/tc20060605_424102.htm) and other mainstream publications.  I read in WP's policies that "Research that consists of collecting and organizing information from primary and secondary sources is, of course, strongly encouraged. This is not "original research"; it is "source-based research", and it is fundamental to writing an encyclopedia."  Aren't we doing exactly this sort of source-based research with the current entry?<br/>-<br/>-In short, after spending some time familiarizing myself with WP's policies and guidelines, I come away puzzled as to why many of the commenters here seem to believe that the inclusion of any entry on 'Enterprise 2.0', let alone the current one, violates policy on verifiability and/or original research.  As argued above, it seems that the topic passes all of the relevant tests for inclusion in WP (other comments here have addressed concerns about notability).  Most of the current entry's editors are, like myself, WP newbies and so have certainly made some mistakes in preparing and structuring the entry, but I don't see how these are grounds for deletion.  Instead, I would hope that the WP community would use the entry's talk page as a forum to help us sharpen the entry over time.<br/>-<br/>-Another set of comments here and on the entry's talk page ask about folding Enterprise 2.0 concepts into WP's existing 'Web 2.0' entry.  I can think of two main reasons not to do this.  The first is the same reason that information about Chihuahuas is not subsumed under the entry for 'dog.'  In other words, even if Enterprise 2.0 were purely a subset of Web 2.0, it might well have sufficiently distinctive history, features, and/or other characteritics to merit a separate entry in an encyclopedia.  But I and others believe, and have previously published on the topic, that Enterprise 2.0 is not simply a subset of Web 2.0 --  that use of these technologies plays out behind the corporate firewall quite differently that it does across the entire Internet (see, for example http://many.corante.com/archives/2006/03/06/an_adoption_strategy_for_social_software_in_the_enterprise.php<br/>-and<br/>-http://blog.hbs.edu/faculty/amcafee/index.php/faculty_amcafee_v3/does_web_20_guarantee_enterprise_20/  )<br/>-<br/>-I hope these comments are helpful.  Thanks for giving me a forum to post them, and for having such a transparent AfD process.[[User:Amcafee|Amcafee]] 18:05, 25 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-::'''comment''' Thank you for your reply Amcafee. While you make a good arguement, the fact of the matter still remains that everything must be verifiable. "Verifiable" in this context means that any reader must be able to check that material added to Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source, because Wikipedia does not publish original thought or original research.  While you state it was in a peer-reviewed journal, the problem is only readers that have access to this journal can verify the information. It must be available to anyone (by heading to the library, searching online, or stopping by a book store).  Unfortunately, even though your blog may spell out parts of the journal, blogs are not accepted as sources in general.  While you may have written the journal article on Enterprise 2.0 (and since you did it is generally, but strongly, frowned on that you work on the wikipedia article) the term still does not have multiple, Independent (from the source...being yourself), reliable, non-trivial, third-party sources. That is the main arguement. Now if the New York Times, Boston Globe, Washington Post, Time Magazine, Newsweek, or some other major publication wrote an article exclusively on the term, or if a book had a chapter on nothing but this term, then the article would have reliable sources.  As it is, we have a journal that the general public does not easily (if at all) have access to and no media mentions.  On a related note: [http://blog.hbs.edu/faculty/amcafee/ the last three enteries on your blog are fairly damning].  ''The Get Out the Vote Drive'' where you tell people ''weigh in on its(enterprise 2.0) 'articles for deletion' entry.'' and that ''Every vote counts, so please take a minute to chime in (respectfully) on this .  Let's get ourselves a not-in-danger-of-deletion-anymore entry that we can refine over time, in keeping with Enterprise 2.0 best practices!''  While I respect your knowledge and status as an Associate Professor, I take a dim view of a person who coins a term also being the person that is the main editor and follower of that term's wikipedia article.  A google news search brings up no articles about the term itself (beyond your blog and an article about this AfD). A dogpile search brings up a lot of talk on the first and second AfD's but no full-length, featured articles about the term itself.  A quick ODIN search of North Dakota and Minnesota's libraries does not bring up any printed articles or books that have the term. (and be careful before commenting, this search also looked into the college libraries. NDSU, Minnesota State Universities (all of them), UND, VCSU, Mayville, NDSCS just to name a few) --[[User:Bschott|<font color="Purple">Brian</font>]] <sup>([[User_talk:Bschott|<font color="orange">How am I doing?</font>]])</sup> 20:33, 25 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-::'''comment''' For an Article on a business topic, [http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/jun2006/tc20060605_424102.htm BusinessWeek's article on Enterprise 2.0] is ample verification acccording to the above.

Thank you for your input into the discussion and for attempting to understand the criteria for inclusion in Wikipedia.  To help out here, citing your own blog does not help establish [[WP:V|Verifiability]].  And as to the Business Week article, the article itself is not about the term "Enterprise 2.0", but about "Web 2.0".  The "Enterprise 2.0" term receives two trivial mentions in that article, one of which is derisive of the term:  "Despite all the activity so far, it's still early days for this phenomenon some techies (who can't help themselves) call Enterprise 2.0."  This quote indicates that even Business Week doubts the validity of the term.  So, overall, what do we have here?<br/>-::*An academic at a respected institution attemps to coin a new term in an article published in a respected journal (SMR).  Fine, but all this means is that there is a new neologism on the block.<br/>-::* The same academic starts promoting the term on his blog.  Fine again, but does not establish verifiability of the term.<br/>-::* Other blogs pick up the term.  Nothing wrong with this, but these are very weak sources for verifiability according to [[WP:RS]].<br/>-::* There is anecdotal use of the term by people who work for various software companies.  Ok, but again does not pass [[WP:RS]].<br/>-::* No other academics (that I have seen cited here, at least) have started to use the term in their own research.<br/>-::* No mainstream business publications have published a non-trivial article regarding the term (that I have seen cited here).  The BusinessWeek mention is trivial, and vaguely derisive at that.<br/>-::* The academic begins to campaign to get readers of his blog to come to Wikipedia and "vote" to keep the article in this AFD ("every vote counts").  But voting is explicitly *not* the purpose of an AFD discussion.<br/>-::* Several new WP editors consequently show up to "vote" in this discussion, several anonymously, several of whom have never edited Wikipedia before.  Almost none of these postings make a coherent argument using Wikipedia criteria (notability, verifiability, etc.):  some because they are new and don't understand these, and others don't even try, they just "vote".<br/>-<br/>-::Also, because you potentially stand to gain personally if this term wins currency in the business community (respect among your peers, consulting engagements, etc.), you are inherently biased on the topic.  So, although I respect your position and your passion for this subject, your comments here, and those of your blog readers can't overcome the fact that this term fails [[WP:V]].  I wish you well personally and if your term does become legitimately verifiable as per [[WP:V]] in the future (or additional citations are posted here), I will gladly support the inclusion of this term in the encyclopedia.

There are, I understand, a large number of companies that produce fake coats of arms for peoples names. The fact that its produced by something in the USA and not by the College Of Heralds suggests its a fake, although it might possibly be a copy of an authentic coat of arms. The coat of arms is not attached to a surname: you are only entitled to use a coat of arms if you have descended through the male line of someone with a coat of arms. I also understand that people of professional standing, including [[Americans]] can apply to the college and be granted a coat of arms, but I expect its an expensive and lengthy process. <br/>+<br/>+:Similar considerations apply to [[tartan]]s. Although there are lots of shops in Edinburgh that claim to find the correct tartan for your surname, they are also strictly for the (mostly American) [[tourist]].<br/>+<br/>+:You could also search on [[Google]] for Broadwater Sussex [[User:81.104.12.46|81.104.12.46]] 23:26, 19 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:All British coats of arms are copyrighted.

I'm fairly sure ''De mulieribus claris'' is online in translation somewhere but I can't find it as yet. These groups of lives were very important in the middle ages as morality tales on how to live and how not to, but they were just a rehash of older sources and so are not really worth continued publication. ''On Famous Women'' is more significant as it reflects attitudes to women in the middle ages.

[[User:Loomis51|Loomis]] 22:27, 20 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+:::::Technically, he was '''Emperor and Autocrat''' of certain places (eg. all the Russias), '''Tsar''' of certain places (eg. Poland, Siberia), '''Lord''' of certain places (eg. Pskov), '''Ruler''' of certain places (eg. Yaroslavl), '''Grand Duke''' of certain places (eg. Finland, Smolensk), and '''Prince''' of certain places (eg. Estonia, Bulgaria).  In common usage, however, the word "tsar" is used in reference to all of his realms.  [[User:JackofOz|JackofOz]] 02:06, 21 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+::::::Right, so even technically he ''was'' a Tsar, amongst other things. I knew of most of the other titles as well, but I was never aware that he ever used the term "Autocrat" in any of his capacities. Were the sensibilities different then, (and/or there,) or did he just not mind having the official title of "Autocrat"? Seems like a title ''I'd'' tend to avoid. [[User:Loomis51|Loomis]] 12:13, 21 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+:::::::I think Russian sensibilities were indeed different.  The tsar made the law, period.  He had his ministers to advise him, but he had the final say.  That was the way Russia did things, and they didn't have any reason to be apologetic about it.  There was not even the pretence of democracy until the first Duma was set up in the early 20th century.  And even then it had to be dragged out of them with threats of revolution.  Russia really was a very backward country in many ways, despite its great writers, artists, composers and scientists.  [[User:JackofOz|JackofOz]] 05:52, 22 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+::::::::Perhaps sensibilities weren't as different as we might imagine. Even the most absolute of leaders are required to show a little respect and deference to their subjects. A society with a leadershp structure wherein the leader is so out of touch with his people and feels no compunction about strutting around and so arrogantly and unnapologetically calling himself an "Autocrat" seems ripe for a revolution, if not during his reign, then at some time in the near future. A similar point can be made of the pre-revolutionary royalty in France.

Anyway, past the hasty generalizations, stereotypes, discrimination, and really bad comedy (really bad), I think the American public just eat up stuff like this. That's why its on tv. Ramsey was a missing pretty white girl, and Americans love that. Its even better if they find her body, or she was raped and killed. Savagely to be entertained by hearing about these things isn't it? The Box is right. The news media sells fear, anything that is significantly bad, gets on the news.

Literally every burp and hiccup by anyone involved in the court case was analyzed with a fine toothed comb by the media. Don't get me wrong. It's not that it wasn't a tragedy, but literally thousands of brutal homicides happen each year in the US, all equally tragic. And I don't ''totally'' buy into the race factor, as of these thousands of homicides, many if not most involve white people. Also, I don't recall there being all too many, if any interesting pics for the media and the public to drool over. Was there something I'm missing about that whole case that made it so newsworthy when so many other similar capital cases were completely overlooked? [[User:Loomis51|Loomis]] 13:49, 20 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::At one point, if I remember correctly, there was a question as to whether Peterson would be charged with the death of just his wife, or his wife and unborn child.

Of the thousands of murders that happen, surely there must be quite a few that are just as if not far more bizarre than this one. Even if it was a bit unique, was it really necessary for the media to dwell on such inane issues as to the whole, weeks long debate as to whether or not the judge should grant a change of venue? I have to admit, I'm something of a news junkie, but whenever CNN or whatever other news station I happened to be watching started going into such ridiculous detail, each with its own special "Peterson Case Special Correspondent", I seriously had to switch channels as quickly as possible just to avoid from puking. This shouldn't be taken in any way as any form of disrespect to the memory of Laci Peterson and her unborn child. Rather, it should be taken as a form of disrespect to the media.  <br/>+<br/>+::::What about that woman, from Texas I believe (?) who drowned several of her kids in the bathtub because "God told her to to it" or something like that. I'm really hazy on the details, but that's because the media didn't give it much attention. Another example is the Elizabeth Smart case. There, unfortunately just like thousands of other American kids, Elizabeth Smart tragically got kidnapped and went missing. Thankfully she was eventually found.

In fact, unlike Peterson, who I know is on death row, I really can't even recall what the final verdict was in the "Yates" case. As for the Duke Lacrosse team case, I'd never even heard of it!

I totally disagree with this concept, however.  I am most concerned with "is that person a continuing threat to others", and anyone with a history of "going insane" and murdering people most definitely qualifies as dangerous to me, no matter how many psychiatrists testify that they are "cured".  Indeed, many people who are "guilty" of murder seem far less dangerous to society, like a woman who kills a man who raped her (and then got off because the police failed to read him his rights), for example.  The only danger that woman poses to society is to those men who rape her, and, honestly, I don't care about their lives.

[[User:StuRat|StuRat]] 03:50, 20 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:StuRat raises an important point - the age at which people die. If you count those who 'died' after conception (if only one hour after it), they would vastly outmnumber those who managed to get born. But another factor is those who died in the first few years after birth. The recent population explosion is due to a great extent to modern medicine preventing that. People were used to having many kids because so many of them died. We're still adapting to that change and only recently in the west are numbers are starting to stabilise again. So there may not have been that many people walking around thosands of years ago, but that's not the numbers one should be looing at here. And another factor that played a role here is that people lived much shorter in earlier times of evolution, which also kept the numbers down (but will conversely increase the amount of people who lived).

The job requires very little skill, there are a huge number of young women willing to do it, really they should get paid no more than [[hairdresser]]s. You could say they get paid for being slim, and being attractive without [[acne]] scars, but there is still a huge over-supply of people who fulfill those criteria. So why does [[Naomi Campbell]] or [[Kate Moss]] get paid such a lot?<br/>+<br/>+:Because, at their peak, they were the very best at what they got paid for, in a job where the distribution of the rewards is strongly skewed towards the very top of the tree.  These days, to be honest, I suspect it's because their fame itself helps to sell products, but at their very best their looks (which doesn't only include their face, for catwalk models their figure and grace up on the catwalk) were such that their appearances in catwalks and magazine covers offered something unique, at the time that that specific look was desirable amongst fashion designers and photographers.  <br/>+<br/>+:Really, your argument is something akin to "anybody can kick a ball, why does Ronaldinho get paid so much?"  --[[User:Robert Merkel|Robert Merkel]] 15:18, 20 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:Supply and demand. High demand for an individual model's time, very low supply. Most places ''don't'' use high-priced models or actresses and will instead look for "fresh faces" who are a lot cheaper. But brand recognition seems to work pretty well and some places think it is worth the price. "Skill" is just another word for "things only a few people can do," and "being Kate Moss" is something which actually requires a lot of "skill" (there is only one). If people want Kate Moss, they have to pay for Kate Moss. If they want "some generic model," then it can (and is) cheaper. There are different reasons to want each. --[[User:Fastfission|Fastfission]] 15:52, 20 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:I hear this question often. Movie stars are overpaid. Authors are overpaid.

It was in truth the common possession of the whole fleet of merchant ships trading to India, China, and Australia: a great company the last years of which coincided with my first years on the wider seas. The fact itself happened on board a very distinguished member of it, ''Cutty Sark'' by name and belonging to Mr. Willis, a notable shipowner in his day, one of the kind (they are all underground now) who used personally to see his ships start on their voyages to those distant shores where they showed worthily the honoured house-flag of their owner.I am glad I was not too late to get at least one glimpse of Mr. Willis on a very wet and gloomy morning watching from the pier head of the New South Dock one of his clippers starting on a China voyage—an imposing figure of a man under the invariable white hat so well known in the Port of London, waiting till the head of his ship had swung downstream before giving her a dignified wave of a big gloved hand.For all I know it may have been the ''Cutty Sark'' herself, though certainly not on that fatal voyage.I do not know the date of the occurrence on which the scheme of ''The Secret Sharer'' is founded; it came to light and even got into newspapers about the middle eighties, though I had heard of it before, as it were privately, among the officers of the great wool fleet in which my first years in deep water were served.</blockquote>{{cite book |editor=Walter F.

Religion is in a lot of ways a metaphor for politics. When Rome was a city-state ruled by an oligarchy, a polytheistic religion made perfect sense, but as it became more autocratic the metaphor began to fall down. Participating in the state religion was an indication of loyalty to the state, and polytheists from whatever culture had no problem with worshipping the Romans gods alongside their own, but Christians couldn't do that. They believed their God was the only god, and to worship any others was wrong - so they couldn't show their loyalty to the state by sacrificing to Jupiter, or to the Emperor. Making Christianity the state religion solved that problem, and now, since everybody was required to worship the same one God, monotheistic religion matched monarchical politics quite nicely.--[[User:Nicknack009|Nicknack009]] 20:15, 20 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:Half remembered books always difficult to find, unlike reasons for the rise of christianity.

That's all I can think of for now. [[User:Anchoress|Anchoress]] 21:22, 20 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+:*Also, the way Jesus' actions could be interpreted as anti-semitic (per the call for the destruction of the temple, his resistance towards the Pharissees' rule of law) is probably appealing to some.

I see polytheism as a metaphor for the psychology of the individual - you can concentrate your worship on the gods you identify with most, while still acknowledging the others as representing something in you - and monotheism as a metaphor for political authority and national unity - Christianity restrained endemic intertribal warfare in Ireland, Islam created political unity in the Arab world. --[[User:Nicknack009|Nicknack009]] 22:11, 20 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+I'm the one that said the ancient Roman religion was silly, but I didn't say all polytheistic religions are.

And having to invent a new myth and/or god/goddess every time you want to explain something, like spiders, is rather painful, isn't it ?

Otherwise, when people see her in their grease stains, they would have to call the new shrine location "the grease stain of the lady formerly known as a virgin".

[[User:Nidhishsinghal|nids]] 22:26, 22 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+Criticism of irrational things is fine as a general proposition.  But when it comes to religion, this breaks down at a certain point.  Religions are about faith in stuff that inherently is unprovable, and therefore irrational.  There would be no point having a religion based on the belief that water is wet - because that is self-evident and needs no faith.  But whether there is a God, or whether Mary remained a virgin even after giving birth to a tribe of kids, etc, that's something else.  The advocates of such beliefs cannot prove them to be true, but the doubters cannot disprove them.  Either you believe them, or you don't.  If you believe them, it's not because they are rationally attractive, because they're not.  It's because you have faith despite the absence of logical support.  On the other hand, when religious organisations go beyond stating beliefs and philosophies about the universe and our place in it, and start advocating violence in any form, they have stepped outside religion and into something else.

The ''Merchant of Venice'' has been one of the most ambivalently interpreted works of art in human history. Did Shakespeare intend Shylock to be sympathised with, or despised? It's hard to say, especially since he was quoted with one of the most meaningful verses in English literature:<br/>+<br/>+:::''Hath not a Jew eyes?

The histories have no significance here as ''The Merchant of Venice'' was clearly not meant to be any sort of historical account. So we're left with the "comedies" (not like today's "comedies" designed to invoke laughter, but rather Shakespearean "comedies" which seem to be defined by their "happy endings",) and his "tragedies" (the opposite, those with "sad endings"). The ending to ''The Merchant of Venice'' was clearly a happy one. Antonio's ships finally come in, all the various love stories are happily fulfilled, and Shylock, the Jew, by means of a silly (almost comedic) technicality is forced to submit to the most humiliating of possible treatments.

I remember a story [[Gabriel Byrne]], an Irishman, told of a visit to Spain where all the locals seemed to think he was a Spaniard fluent in Spanish, simply because he ''looks'' more Mediterranean than Irish.

There was a wonderful ''Far Side'' cartoon with two jellyfish outhouses with identical looking drawings on the doors with the caption "Only they can tell the difference," or something to that effect. It makes good evolutionary sense that humans have a hyper-sensitive view of the details of in-group individuals and a considerably less powerful one of out-group individuals, even if it ''does'' lead to all sorts of social difficulties in the long run.

A combo of new technology (drugs, foods, exercise equipment, etc.) and government regulations (banning trans fat additives and junk food vending machines in schools, for example) will eventually start to pay off and weights will start to taper off.  Eventually, I'd expect to have pills available which can control appetites without serious side effects.  [[User:StuRat|StuRat]] 18:41, 21 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:A possible cause for this is that one extreme leads to another (a pehnomenon I notice in many fields). The US beauty ideal, I believe, includes being very thin (skin and bones even). Since for most people that is not a real option they think they're fat and also by US standards (stop me if I'm over-generalising) if you're not a winner you're a loser (no gradation), so if you're fat you're FAT, so you might as well be '''FAT''' - what's the difference. Just a little theory of mine. Also, calling fat 'obese', as if it's normal, doesn't really help either, I suppose.  [[User:DirkvdM|DirkvdM]] 18:55, 21 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::I really think it's unfair to call it "the US body ideal". It's more of a western thing. The models on the runways of Paris and Milan are just as "skin and bones" as those in New York. Also, maybe this is a language thing, but the term "obese" doesn't seem to be a euphemism for fat, quite the opposite. [[Obesity]] is actually considered by the American medical community to be a serious health issue, and many would very straightforwardly call it a disease. To us regular laypeople, while the term "fat" is often used to describe those who are somewhat overweight, the term "obese" is generally restricted to the most extreme cases.

I don't see it as much different from, let's say, height in that sense. Most people in North America these days are taller than their parents. I'm taller than my father, and my father was taller than his father before him. But that doesn't mean that 100 years from now the average North American will be 7 feet tall. From what I understand, it's more about fulfilling one's height potential than any sort of evolutionary process. Had my grandfather lived in the far more prosperous, medically advanced North America of today, he'd probably have come closer to his real height potential than he did. [[User:Loomis51|Loomis]] 19:28, 21 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:When talking about trends like obesity it makes more sense to think about them as they incidence in the population, not as "every increasing sizes". The current worry is not that there will be 600 lb Americans but that, say, 70% of all Americans will be obese (I made the percentage up). Unlike a flu epidemic, obesity is not a contagious disease which one can become immune to over time (or will eventually be unable to infect others for some reason)—it is a "lifestyle disease" and has a totally different sort of "tranmission". Thinking of it as analogous to contagious diseases is not, in my opinion, very useful (though there was recently a New York Times article on some sort of proposed causal link between microbes and obesity or something like that but I didn't read it closely). As for weight regulating instincts—most likely they do (rats seem to, and you can turn it on and off with genetic knockout procedures), but whether or not this inclination can battle the instinct towards high-fat foods (which evolutionarily makes sense, even if in today's production system it is not very healthy) or a culture in which healthy food is rather expensive and exercise is entirely optional is precisely the problem at hand. --[[User:Fastfission|Fastfission]] 22:10, 21 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+:::Here is a link to the NYT article: [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/13/magazine/13obesity.html?ex=1156392000&en=2d17b598cc4863ca&ei=5070].

Hitler and his military advisors are known to have greatly feared that second front, which is why they tolerated US aid to Britain for so long.  The US provided the crucial heavy machinery and manpower to break through German fortifications and turn the tables of the war.  --[[User:Bmk|Bmk]] 00:13, 22 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+I would think that, if Germany had not declared war on the US after [[Pearl Harbor]] (figuring they could defeat the US in conjunction with the Japanese), then the US would not have declared war on Germany, preferring to finish off Japan first.  Let's assume that the Manhattan project goes forward as planned, and Japan is defeated, perhaps a bit earlier than in the real timeline.  By this time, Germany would have defeated the UK, Russia, and any other opposition in Europe, Africa, and mainland Asia.  Now, there would be a fierce debate in the US: "We have nuclear weapons, and could defeat the Nazis if we attack now, but if we wait, they will get the bomb and we will have a stalemate."  On the other hand will be those who would argue: "They haven't attacked us, so a preemptive nuclear war is morally unjustifiable."  We may have ended up with a policy somewhere in between, like an ultimatum that Germany withdraw to the pre-war borders or be attacked.  Then, if they complied, we would be left with Germany in it's pre-1939 borders, but, eventually, with nuclear weapons.  At that point, a cold war with Germany would likely result. [[User:StuRat|StuRat]] 02:31, 22 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:German generals seemed to agree that the war was lost the moment Germany started a second front by attacking the USSR. Contrary to popular belief, the eastern front was decisive in the outcome. As an indication, of the 17 million allied military [[WWII#Casualties.2C_civilian_impact.2C_and_atrocities|casualties]], 10 million were Soviet (and 4 million Chinese). (Yes, StuRat, I know it is only an indication.)<br/>+<br/>+::It's not even an indication, taking heavy casualties is more of a counter-indication, showing that you are not fighting effectively. Using your logic, China was the most important in defeating Japan, because China had so many casualties in Manchuria.  Now, if you measured how many of the German casualties were caused by Soviet forces vs US forces, there you would have a bit of an indication, but that's hardly conclusive.  Most of what the US did was "behind the lines" in Europe, especially early in the war, in providing weapons, money, equipment, etc., to the Allies, as in the phrase the [[Arsenal of Democracy]].  This type of support, while critical for victory, neither inflicts or incurs heavy casualties. [[User:StuRat|StuRat]] 02:29, 23 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:Speaking of StuRat, the question was what if the US had not entered the war at all. So that would be if neither Germany nor Japan had attacked and declared war on the US. A world with three central powers would be interresting. Countries always strive for having only one enemy (keeps it simpler for the home front). If there are two, alliances are made. The US would have had to choose between nazis and commies. In reality they were forced to cooperate with the commies. In a stable situation (if such a thing would arise), my guesss is they would have figured that both were dictatorships, which is bad, but that one had the wrong economic system (which somehow seems to be a big deal). Then again, I believe Hitler regarded the US lifestyle as degenerate, so if he would have secured Europe, he might still have attacked the US.<br/>+<br/>+:Locally, non-cooperation, resistance (nowadays called terrorism) and occasionally even guerrilla warfare would keep on pestering the nazis, ultimately possibly sapping their resources. Even without external help that would eventually defeat them, but that might have taken a century. <br/>+<br/>+::Wrong.  Terrorism only works, and just barely at that, against democracies, by influencing public opinion.  The Nazis would have just responded with genocide.  If there is any resistance in an area, they would kill everyone in that area.  Eventually, such a method is bound to work, as there will be nobody left to resist.  More likely, after a few rounds of genocide, the remaining resistance would decide they were doing more harm than good and stop fighting. [[User:StuRat|StuRat]] 02:19, 23 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:Another factor is the nature of nazism. Hitler encouraged spontaneous actions and people (even lowranking military) taking control locally. Eventually, this might have led to the empire falling apart. But that is really wild speculation. [[User:DirkvdM|DirkvdM]] 05:08, 22 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+The key second question you have to ask, assuming that the US didn't enter the war in Europe, was whether they would continue to support the other Allies financially and materially. Even before December 1941 Britain would have been in terrible trouble without US financial support. However if the US had continued, or even stepped up, financial and material support to both the UK and the Soviets there is good reason to believe that the Allies would have been victorious in Europe. Britain was probably capable of taking back North Africa without US troops, freeing up her supply lines to the Far East. They key question then would have been whether Britain alone could have maintained enough of a threat against Western Europe to prevent the Germans reinforcing the Eastern front. If so then the Eastern front campaign would have gone pretty much as it did, still resulting in an Allied victory. Alright, really a Soviet one. Which would have made a big difference to the shape of Europe today. [[User:DJ Clayworth|DJ Clayworth]] 15:03, 22 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+The U.S was bound to go to war with Japan as soon as they attacked Pearl Harbor successfully. Japan felt they had to move because they lacked native petroleum supplies and they lackedproduction of metals needed to build ships, planes, and tanks. Roosevelt had cut off shipments of oil and scrap iron which the Japanese required, to punish them for their continued occupation of China. Had the US detected the Japanese attack (not too hard, since they spotted the planes on radar and ignored them) or if our carrier based planes had spotted the Japanese ships, and we had repulsed the attack, we could have defeated the Japanese empire fairly quickly. Knowing this, Hitler might not have declared war on the US. Then we (the US) would have devoted all forces to the Pacific War. Hitler would have likely invaded Britain and obtained an armisticve, and installed a puppet regime there, as was his fond wish. The US would have had no reason to invade Britain or Africa. We would have "pacified" Japan by invasion or armistice. Without the Pearl Harbor motivation, we would have had no ned to demand unconditional surrender. Hitler cold have defeated Russia, using the troops he had to station in France to defend against Britain, and the troops he had to station in Africa to defend against the US. Germany would have completed their fleet and their advanced weapons, including nukes. The US would have completed our nukes. A different cold war would have ensued.  . Germany would likely control the middle east oil supply. There might possibly be a Jewish state, since deportation was one way the Nazis considered for removing the Jews from Germany and nearby German speaking areas. They considered Madagascar, but who can say they would not have sent them to Israel. They would have been under German control, and perhaps hostages against attack by the US on the German empire. South America would have been an area of great tension, with Germany seeking naval bases in this hemisphere. Japan might have become a allied with the US after the war regime there was defeated politically, as would have happened after defeat of their navy . China's future status would be questionable: world power or vassal of the Third Reich or the US- Japan alliance? Would the Reich control Indochina by their Vichy puppets? What of India Likely the Reich would follow their conquest of Europe, Russia, and the Middle East with expansion into the Indian subcontinent. Goods would be cheaply  produced by slave labor to enrich the German homelands, whose Homeland Security would be assured by the armies and navies of Britain, France, and Italy in addition to Germany's own navy, which never amounted to much other than the Uboat fleet, because the war did not not last long enough.

He speaks English (with some fallacies) and French quite well.  He spoke French on Flemish television, but English on Dutch television.  He wears glasses.  Recently, when the war was over, he said "Yes I am terrorist.  But what is a terrorist" and then he referred to Qana. Who is he?<br/>+<br/>+Now some questions about the Lebanese parliament : <br/>+<br/>+as I understand the system of a parliament (this is how it goes in Belgium as far as I know), is that the country is divided into certain areas, and each area can choose its own representatives, a number which depends on the area in question.  But in Lebanon there have to be 64 seats taken by muslims, and 64 by christians.  So how does this work?  What if almost all people in all areas voted for christian parties, who decides which areas have to provide the muslim seats?<br/>+<br/>+And a last question : I see Amal and Hizbullah participated in the 2005 elections in one "Resistance Block".  Didn't these two fight each other in the civil war?<br/>+<br/>+Thank you!<br/>+<br/>+[[User:Evilbu|Evilbu]] 23:14, 21 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+First off, stop calling yourself a dummy! :-)<br/>+<br/>+I take it that you're Belgian. Unlike my country's [[first past the post]] electoral system, yours seems to be one of [[proportional representation]]. What that means is that each party provides a list of their candidates. Say your parliament has 100 seats. Each party provides a list of its 100 candidates in order of priority. You then vote for your favourite party. if your party gets, say 20% of the vote, then the first 20 members on that party's list get seats in parliament.<br/>+<br/>+<br/>+It would seem that according to the Lebanese Constitution, Lebanon's Parliament consists of 128 seats. 64 are reserved for Christians and 64 for Muslims. So say there are 10 parties. 5 Muslim and 5 Christian. (Of course there could just as well be mixed parties, including both Christians and Muslims, but let's assume that party allegiance is based purely on religion).<br/>+<br/>+So, in a sense, at election time, the Lebanese Parliament is divided in two. Of the Christian parties, the 64 seats are allocated according to proportional representation, based on the total number of votes cast for these Christian parties, and allocated proportionately. Same goes for the Muslim "half". I could be wrong, but that would seem to be the natural way the system would work.

At first I thought a simple explanation of the difference between proportional representation and the "first-past-the-post" electoral system, with a little twist in order to account for the Christian/Muslim allocation would do, but I realize now that it must be way more complicated than that. There are all kinds of hybrid systems involving some sort of combination of the two, added to that the fact that I don't know a great deal about how the Lebanese system works in particular. I'm definitely no expert in the various electoral systems that exist, and so, admittedly, the question is far further above my head than I had originally thought. My apologies for adding to your confusion. [[User:Loomis51|Loomis]] 11:59, 23 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:Yes, the electoral system in Lebanon is quite complex and controversial (there have been caricatures about how noone understands the electoral law). I'll try to simplify for you. Seats are divided: 64 christians and 64 muslims. Plus they are further divided by confession (eg: 34 for maronite, 14 for orthodox, 27 Sunni, 27 Shia...) between the dozen of confessions. Furthermore, the electoral law divides the country into electoral districts. Each one is assigned a number of seats for each confession (eg: for Beirut First District 10 seats: 6 Sunni, 1 Maronite...). Therefore each political party or coalition must present a list in each electoral district which contains candidates for each "confessional" seat. So, parties must make coalitions to fill the list. An example in the last election: In the southern districts (mostly shi'a seats) , The Hizbullah (shi'a party) had to ally with the Future Movement (Sunni) and the Syrian Socialist party (secular) to fill the seats. And in the mountains districts (mostlt christian seats), they had to ally with Hizbullah to fill the one shi'a seat.<br/>+:I hope this clarifies this complex issue for you. If you need more clarifications just ask me.<br/>+:As for the name of the Hezbollah deputy, I think you're talking about Hussein Hajj Hassan.<br/>+:And I forgot your last question. Coalition in Lebanon changes for month to month (Politics is very complex). Therefore they were fighting during the war 20 years ago, now Amal and Hezbollah are from one soul (According to Hassan Nasrallah). Another example. Hezbollah and the Progressive Party were allies until the last year when they ''suddenly'' became fierce opposants.

Some local regions do still accept them in payment in protest of the introduction of the Euro, however this is not strictly a bona fide means of settling up.  As given above, the national banks of each member state will be happy to exchange bank notes issued within their own boundaries, but you must go in in person or post it to them at your own risk.  Similarly, countries like the UK will exchange notes withdrawn from circulation indefinately.  My advice would be:  unless you have a serious hoard of foreign currency, hang on to it.

Pretty much my favourite book ever is one written for teenagers. I think it was originally written in French by a French-Canadian but I'm not sure. It's about a girl (whose name I forget, lovely) who gets into a fight at school then goes to hide in the janitor's closet to avoid getting in trouble. There she is electrocuted by a faulty floor-polishing machine. Her spirit is accidentally joined with that of a time-travelling being called Entity. The girl doesn't want to die and Entity doesn't want to drag her around, so they have to try to find a new body for the girl. However they can only take someone's body at a time where they do not wish to be themselves anymore, so she winds up trying to get out of various horrible mishaps including being eaten by a dragon. Eventually they discover that they can change time, so they go back to where the fight happened and prevent the girl from going into the janitor's closet, but in doing so they cause the boy she had the fight with to go there, so he gets electrocuted and joined to the entity.

As a serving police officer she is the only person I cannot arrest.  Even diplomats, although immune from prosecution can be detained until their credentials are verified.  The Queen is the embodiement of the law and is where constable's powers stem from (we are crown servants etc).  A more realistic example might be the fact that the Queen does not require a driving licence and has and does drive on public roads.

What title does Diana take if (a) Charles predeceases his mother and (b) vice versa? (i'm especially interested in case a).  Would she retain the style "Princess of Wales" ?  assuming she lives long enough for William V's son to be born and take a wife: what happens then? (does he become Prince of Wales?) [[User:Morwen|Morwen]] - [[User_talk:Morwen|Talk]] 20:18, 22 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:In case A what matters is if William has already become prince of Wales before the Queen died. Assuming she died before her grandson inherited the title, William would be crowned asap, but aslong he was a minor his mother Diana would be [[:regent]] of the kingdom and mantain her title of Princess of Wales (I think). He would not become prince of Wales because that title is reserved to the male [[:heir-apparent]] and his wife, the oldest son of the ruling British monarch (notice that William would allready be king - thereby jumping over the "prince of Wales step"). As William became of age his mother Diana would most likely lose her title as Princess and become the "[[:English and British Queen Mothers|Queen mother]]" like the (now deceased) mother of Queen Elizabeth. The (future) son of William would eventually become the new prince of Wales, inheriting the title from his deceased grandfather Charles "longhears" :). <br/>+<br/>+:In case B) what really maters if Charles had enough time to be crowned King (Diana becoming Queen or consort), and to invest William with the title of prince of Wales. If yes then William would become King having been prince of Wales allready (a rather smoth succession) and his mother would become Queen mother. If Charles had enough time to become King but not enough time to invest his son with the "prince of Wales" title, William would jump over the prince step as above, while his mother Diana would become the Queen mother. <br/>+<br/>+:Either way Diana never would rule alone as Queen of the UK, for she is not in the succession line (she is not of royal blood but the wife and mother of kings). She would never be Queen and would always become Queen mother.<br/>+ <br/>+:I am not very knowlegable about the current rules of the British monarchy and the rules of inherinting a noble title however, I might be wrong on this. A regent was someone who ruled while the new king was underage, but in modern times it doesn't make much sense for the parlament rules. But it is very likely they would keep the ilusion (aka the show must go on) because of tradition. Still it is a unclear situation, the brother of Charles, [[:Prince Andrew]] could become regent instead of Diana. I also am not very sure if the widow of a prince of wales mantains her title or not.

But the British tend to improvise, and Diana's style is at the will of the King; William could announce her style to be "Queen Mother" and it would be so ([[Elena of Greece]], mother of King [[Michael of Romania]] was Queen Mother without ever having been a Queen Consort.) - <span style="font-family: cursive">[[User:Nunh-huh|Nunh-huh]]</span> 06:09, 24 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::::So, she becomes "HM Queen Diana the Queen Mother" if Brenda dies first and "HRH The Dowager Princess of Wales" or somesuch if Chaz dies first?

There is also [[democratic socialism]]. In theory it means: socialism in a democratically organized society. In practice there is often little political difference between movements labelling themselves as democratic socialists and those who call themselves social democrats. This is not to say that socialists who do not call themselves "democratic socialists" are thereby less democratic. States that label(led) themselves as "socialist", on the contrary, have been very easy to call themselves "democratic" but have actually been very autocratic. Very schematically: In a socialist state the means of production are in the hands of the people (publicly owned). In a social democratic state they are in the hands of the capitalists (privately owned), but the liberty of the capitalists to do as they please is to a certain extent curbed by laws: no child labour, safety measures for the workers, minimum wages, etcetera. --[[User:Lambiam|Lambiam]][[User talk:Lambiam|<small><sup>Talk</sup></small>]] 01:49, 23 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+::Thanks for that description, I'd been curious too.

You don't just "join a monotheistic religion" for the sake of it. That is a possible explanation of why you don't understand what it means to have faith. You get faith when you hear something that has a "ring of truth" to it, and believe it. Faith is believing something without necessarily having full information about it. If you are serious, read the New Testament. You may well discover what faith is. [[User:BenC7|BenC7]] 07:16, 23 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+The easiest way to get faith in a religion is to investigate its claims. Talk to people who espouse that religion; read its books; talk to people with opposite views. At some point you will decide either that there is enough evidence to convince you that its true, or enough to convince you that its false. Then you can join or not, depending on the answer. That's how most people do it who aren't brought up in a religion. However don't wait for 'proof' either way. Pretty much nothing in this life can be proved conclusively.

If you are absolutely convinced that your religion is true, you are probably not in a spiritually sound position.  To the original poster, for an introduction to Christianity, I'd read the Gospel of St Mark and C.S. Lewis's ''Surprised by Joy''.  The latter is an easy read yet also conveys the meaning of faith better than most religious texts.  You might also find it useful to talk to your local priest/minister and, if you find some truth, perhaps to consider baptism and confirmation.  I can't say for other religions, but it would probably be useful to talk to ministers of those religions.

It would seem (and I'm only guessing here) that you believe in one God, but aren't quite sure which interpretation of His existence you want to ascribe to. There's no need to choose, unless one just jumps out at you as matching very well with your particular spirituality. For now, all I'd suggest is to describe yourself as an undecided [[Monotheist]]. There's nothing wrong with that. And if I'm wrong, and you don't have any particular monotheistic leanings, just describe yourself as an [[Agnostic]]. All that means is that you're not quite sure what you believe, which is perfectly ok as well.

That is far more enjoyable (at least in the short term) than what God asks us to do (i.e., make Him number one, not put self first).

You seem to imply that by believing in God you're making some sort of sacrifice in this world, only for some big payoff in the next. I disagree with that too. I believe in God because, to me at least, it makes sense ''in this world'', nevermind the next. I don't believe in hell. If I did, and if I believed in God only for the sake of avoiding damnation, don't you think that make me some sort of ... I can't think of the word ... "weasel"?

Some are treated like dogs. Do you think that God is just? I do. There must be some sort of reckoning, some time where justice is served - because God is just, but there are many who have been denied justice. I can't possibly believe that people who are treated like animals in this life have nothing better to hope for, and people who live long, mistreat others, amass riches, live like kings at the expense of the poor, and are concerned about no-one but themselves have nothing to fear from God.

It does not, it only means torture is justified in certain circumstances, such as the hypothetical one listed.  As such, this argument would definitely fall into the category of "moral relativism", versus "moral absolutism", which would say any torture is immoral and should be avoided regardless of how many people will die as a direct result.

[[User:StuRat|StuRat]] 05:27, 23 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:So what would you do if the hypothetical scenario posted by Lisiate came up?  Torture the suspect?  If he didn't want to tell you the location, he'll simply tell you a false location.  By the time you figure out he was lying, the nuke would have gone off.  (Even if it hadn't, all you can do is torture the suspect again, after which he will tell you another false location.  But the only way to know whether he's lying or not is to dig up the location.)  --[[User:Bowlhover|Bowlhover]] 05:47, 23 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:::That would depend on the type of torture.

Bowlhover raises a good point about the efficacy of torture as a whole. Still, no one so far seems to know of a clearer example than the German kidnapping case. And while the hypothetical situation may make for an interesting discussion point the lack of any real examples surely diminishes the force of the argument.

This is along the same lines as the Red Menace justified creation of a police Red Squad in such cities as Chicago in the 1960's to prevent the overthrow of our government by force and violence, , and to prevent bearded anarchist pinko commies hippies from throwing bombs at police. Then of course the unit was used almost exclusively to spy on political opponents of the mayor, labor leaders, and civil rights leaders with surveillance, illegal wiretaps, and illegal searches. Former FBI agents have reported diong the same thing. [[User:Edison|Edison]] 14:36, 23 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:No, it doesn't justify legalizing torture in all cases.  Using your analogy, there were real communist spies in the US, such as [[Ethel and Julius Rosenberg]].

[[User:StuRat|StuRat]] 08:37, 24 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+What's really interesting about the German case is that no actual torture took place. It was just the threat of torture, which in Germany was treated as a real human rights issue. When compared with current U.S. practices like [[extraordinary rendition]] (sending uncharged detainees to a regime that you know will torture them) this seems unimaginably tame. In a number of current stories in the press there have been detainees who were threatened with not only being sent to a country to be tortured themselves, but that the CIA would have those countries torture their families as well. One wonders if any of the "intel" gained by these operations was worth sacrificing the moral highground in such an ugly way.

So it depends on the point of view you want to analyze the question from, i.e. would a Catholic consider him a Christian, or would a Methodist, or would a Muslim, etc. Because you would probably get different answers depending on the theological tradition you are addressing it from (a Muslim would probably see no distinction there, for example, whereas another denomination of Christianity possibly could). --[[User:Fastfission|Fastfission]] 13:31, 23 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+Anyone is free to create his own Christian sect, consisting of him and whomever he can win over, rejecting any part of traditional Christianity he does not like. There have been thousands of such: gnostics, Marcionists, etc etc etc. If in addition they claim to have a special revelation from God, or a prophet, mainstream religions would call them a cult, a label which has been applied to everything from LDS to Amana Colonies who claim to be Christians but with additional devine revelations.

Edward IV showed him preferment in allowing him to marry Elizabeth, the heiress of Lord Scales. A most accomplished soldier and learned man, he was a continuous patron of Caxton and translated for him the first dated book printed in England. He had fought on the Lancastrian side at Towton but after the battle transferred his allegiance to the victorious Yorkist king and was confirmed in his father-in-law's title of Lord Scales in 1462. Following the marriage of his sister, Elizabeth, to the king, his advance was very rapid. He was a member of the embassy which arranged the match between the Duke of Burgundy and Edward's sister, Margaret, in 1467, and in the net year he accompanied the bride to Bruges, where he took part in a brilliant tournament. He escaped the fate of his father and brother at Edgecote in 1469 and succeeded as the second Earl Rivers. He shared Edward's exile in Holland, returned with him in 1471, helped to secure the victory at Barnet and beat off the Bastard of Fauconberg's attack on London. In 1473 he became the guardian of the young Prince of Wales and Chief Butler of England. He went on a pilgrimage to Rome in 1475, where he was invested by Pope Sixtus IV with the title of Defender and Director of Papal Causes in England. During his absence his wife had died, so a marriage was sought with Margaret, daughter of James III of Scotland. When Edward IV died in 1483, Rivers, Grey and the Prince of Wales set out for London. After reaching Stony Stratford they met Gloucester and Buckingham, who had Rivers and Grey arrested and later executed at Pontefract.<br/>+<br/>+We gave it to two translators already and here is what they told me.

[[User:Loomis51|Loomis]] 22:08, 23 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:In actually trying to answer the question, one would have to first put out the limits of what they would consider the causal effect of racism. If you consider demasculination, poor education, general poverty, and a perception of a lack of upward options to be a residual cultural result of decades of racism, some of which continues today in usually less overt forms, then sure, it could easily be the effect of long-standing racism, though that would be more of an ultimate effect rather than an immediate one. If you are unwilling to grant that level of proximity to the causality, and instead put more effort on community actions or individual choices, then one would conclude that racism itself is not likely a cause. In any case, though, there are big social, economic, and cultural conditions which ''are'' the cause, and whether or not you ultimately tie those back in some way to the history of racism towards African-Americans in the United States—and personally I find it hard ''not'' to, most of this stuff is ''not'' ancient history—depends on your own view of social-cultural-historical causality. --[[User:Fastfission|Fastfission]] 02:40, 24 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:The original question is clearly racist rolling.

[[User:Loomis51|Loomis]] 21:53, 23 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::Actually, a dirty bomb would have been possible in the middle ages.  All that would be necessary is to mine lots of uranium, then blow it up near the enemy, or maybe launch it at the enemy's castle with a catapult.  However, as nobody knew about the effects of radiation or how to identify uranium deposits, they wouldn't have known to do this.  If somebody from the present was sent back in time, though, they could use such a dirty bomb and then say they had put a magical curse on the enemy.  When the enemy started suffering from radiation sickness, they would believe in the "magic" and surrender. [[User:StuRat|StuRat]] 23:43, 23 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:::No it wouldn't, at least not using uranium.  Natural uranium (or even highly enriched uranium) is not particularly radioactive.  The risks uranium poses are pretty much equivalent to lead or other heavy metals - they're nasty stuff, but it doen't make an effective weapon unless you form it into bullets or shells and shoots them at things.   --[[User:Robert Merkel|Robert Merkel]] 03:07, 24 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::::Well, dirty bombs aren't particularly effective in a military sense, meaning they don't kill many people very quickly.  They are more of a psychological weapon, with large numbers of people feeling that they have been poisoned.  It's only necessary for a small number of people to become sick for this effect to occur.  If you could deliver dust from some naturally occurring radioactive element to the enemy castle, people who inhale that dust might very well get sick. [[User:StuRat|StuRat]] 06:13, 24 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:::::Yes, but there's degrees of radioactivity.  Uranium's rate of natural [[radioactive decay]] is so incredibly slow that it poses essentially no radiological risk.  If you processed a huge quantity of uranium ore and extracted some of the radioactive decay products (such as radioactive barium and radium), you might get enough for a dirty bomb, but the huge effort required would be far better spent turning the resulting uranium metal into high-density cannonballs.  Not to mention that any "dirty bomb" lethal enough to kill the bad guys soon enough to be relevant would probably have killed your troops in the handling process.

People prone to hallucinations often perceive non-physical phenomena such as angels, visions or the voices of departed spirits, demons, God, or angels. It is very common, much more than you might think. People who receive hallucinations often believe them to be real, and act upon them, completely ignoring the learned people that diagnose them with [[schizophrenia]], or tell them things are not real. They often create some kind of fantasy that gives an explanation to why the hallucinator is special. Often a "holy-than-thou" argument, or just non-believing what they hear is not existant.

These things are not of God, and I suggest that you see a Christian counsellor. He or she will tell you the same thing.

It is a dressed-up version of the old [[Liar's paradox]]. While the latter is usually resolved by declaring self-reference unlawful, it is supposed to be acceptable in knowledge and belief logics for agents, so it rears its taunting little head again. Logicians and semanticists are renowned for their ability to go into strange contortions to avoid pardoxes; the resulting papers are not always as perspicuous as we'd like. Here is my resolution. A is the agent, who states at time T: "I know that what I say now is not true." Let us assume, for simplicity, that A knows at time T that (s)he is A, and that "now" is T. Define the self-referential statement S by: S = "A knows at time T that S is not true at time T". A's utterance is then equivalent to: "A knows that S is true". It now follows that S is false, since it is not possible (because of the paradox) that A knew S to be false. A may have ''believed'', but did not ''know'', when uttering that statement, that it was false. Therefore A was, possibly unwittingly, speaking an untruth. --[[User:Lambiam|Lambiam]][[User talk:Lambiam|<small><sup>Talk</sup></small>]] 21:45, 24 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+thank u!:D ... so basically what it says is that when I say ''I know apples are red'' and apples are indeed not red I'm lying even if i'm unaware of it? :s...

Since S, by the form of its definition, is clearly not itself time-dependent, we can replace "S is not true at time T" by "S is not true". A crucial axiom of knowledge logics is that "A knows X" entails X. Justification: if X is false, A can perhaps ''believe'' it, but cannot ''know'' it. I shall proceed to demonstrate now that A was not speaking the truth. First, assume S is true. Then (by definition of S) A knows at time T that S is not true. Therefore (knowledge-logic axiom) S is not true. Contradiction. ''Ergo'', the assumption was wrong: S is not true. But A said: "I know that S is true". As before, if A was speaking the truth, S would be true, ''quod non''. ''Ergo'', A was not speaking the truth. --[[User:Lambiam|Lambiam]][[User talk:Lambiam|<small><sup>Talk</sup></small>]] 04:03, 25 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+<br/>+Right ooooon!!!

He was born here and has always been an Australian who, like many Aussie celebrities, chooses to live elesewhere for most of the time.  There is no issue about his Australian-ness.  But Mel was born in the US, and only lived in Australia from age 12.  Apparently he has never become an Australian citizen - which I must say was a surprise to me when I checked out our article.  Ever since the early days of his career, he has always been described in Australia as "an Australian actor" (of American heritage), because here is where he spent much of his formative years, and here is where he did his acting studies (at [[NIDA]]), and here is where his career started.  When he won his Oscar for Braveheart, he was hailed as "the latest Aussie success at the Oscars".  Also, I believe his mother is Australian-born (although our article makes no mention of that).  When Aussie celebrities behave themselves overseas, we claim them as our own; but when they're naughty (eg. [[Errol Flynn]], [[Russell Crowe]], et al), we're more than happy to disown them.  I guess it's undisputably true to say that Mel Gibson is Australian by association, but whether the Aussie man in the street would regard him as an Aussie, particularly after his most recent unpleasantness, is another question.  How's that for a sit-on-the-fence answer?  [[User:JackofOz|JackofOz]] 05:02, 26 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:::I do, but that's because I associate the actor with his early film roles, and these were in movies that were very Australian - ''[[Summer City]], [[Gallipoli (1981 film)|Gallipoli]]'' and ''[[Mad Max]]'', even ''[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080024 Tim]''. I think of Mel Gibson as Max Rockatansky and Frank Dunne before William Wallace and until that association changes, he'll be an Australian actor.

He has spent more than 30 years researching [[orcas]] (or Killer whales) and is credited with increasing public awareness on [[whaling]], with his involvement with [[Greenpeace]].<br/>-<br/>-==Early life==<br/>-'''Paul Spong''' was born in [[Whakatane]], near the north-east coast of New Zealand, in [[1939]]. He studied law at the [[University of Canterbury]] in [[Christchurch]]. <br><br/>-In [[1963]] Spong enrolled in the [[Brain Research Institute]] (BRI) at the [[UCLA|University of California in Los Angeles]] (UCLA) to study post-graduate psychology. His work at the BRI included analysis of human brain wave patterns and tracking information pathways. Spong did his [[doctorate]] on sensory stimulation, perception, and human consciousness.<br/>-<br/>-==Transfer to Vancouver==<br/>-In [[1967]] Dr. Murray Newman, off the [[Vancouver Aquarium Marine Science Centre|Vancouver Aquarium]], asked Dr. Patrick McGeer, head of the Neurological Lab at the [[University of British Columbia]] (UBC), to find a "whale scientist" to assist him at the aquarium. Dr. Spong was selected as the candidate to work at the Vancouver Aquarium with [[orca]] whales (Orcinus orca) after a successful interview and a recommendation from the head of the lab at UCLA. <br/>-<br/>-Dr. Spong arrived in Vancouver, with his wife Linda, in April 1967. This was two months after [[Skana]], the orca that Paul would be working with, had been bought by the Vancouver Aquarium from the The Pacific Northwest Boat Show. <br/>-<br/>-==Whale Research==<br/>-Dr. Spong started his research on Skana by testing her eye sight. This was done by rewarding the whale (with a herring fellet) every time she could distinguish between one or two horizontal lines. However, Paul soon noticed that Skana's enthusiasm had waned and her success rate fell to 0%. After doing research, Dr. Spong contemplated whether the whale was trying to communicate with him and giving him wrong answers on purpose. This was the first break through Paul had in understanding orca's complex communication system.<br/>-<br/>-In April 1968, a second orca, [[Hyak]] was captured and brought to the Aquarium. Hyak was kept in a separate pool from Skana. Dr. Spong thought that Hyak was in deep depression after being captured, and thus tried to stimulate the orca by conductive experiments. Paul learnt the importance of acoustics for orcas through these experiments. He noticed that when the two whales swam together in the same pool they vocalized and sung together. Thus Dr. Spong started experimenting with music and sound and noticed Hyak's recovery from lethargy.<br/>-<br/>-Dr. Paul Spong believed that his frequent interactions with the whales allowed him to communicate with them. He established this by an event with Skana. The whale would brush her teeth against the Dr. Spong's feet repeatedly until he no longer pulled them out of the water. Dr. Spong considered this a conscious deconditioning of his fear by the whale. After this event Dr. Spong started freely swimming with the whales on a regular basis. <br/>-<br/>-===1968 Lecture===<br/>-<br/>-In a [[1968]], Dr. Paul Spong delivered a lecture at UBC, describing his experience with the two whales at the Vancouver Aquarium. He described the whales as "highly intelligent, social animals" and advised that they should not be kept in captivity. He proposed transferring the whales to a semi-wild environment (such as Pearl Harbour) in order to study them in their natural habitat. Dr. Spong also mentioned that humans could someday communicate with whales.<br/>-<br/>-His comments from this lecture were published in local newspapers and interviews with radio stations were scheduled. However, the Dr. Newman from the Aquarium did not appreciate the fact that Dr. Spong's recommendation on freeing the whales. This pushed him to suspend the research project Dr. Spong was working on. <br/>-<br/>-Soon after, Dr. Paul Spong was asked to check in at the psychiaty clinic at UBC by the acting head of the lab. This was because of his periodic agitated, panicky and "out of control" behaviour. Paul later admitted to taking [[mescaline]] during this period. While in the psychiatric ward, his job at the aquarium was terminated, and rumour spread that Paul had mental problems. This was a serious set back in his attempt to increase awareness about orcas.<br/>-<br/>-==KWOOF==<br/>-Killer Whale (Orcinus Orca) Foundation, or KWOOF was the foundation that Dr. Paul Spong created with his $4000 separation package from the University. The purpose of the foundation was to stop whale captures in [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. <br><br/>-In Decemeber [[1969]] Spong travelled to [[Pender Harbour]], where fisherman had capture 12 whales. Off the 12 whales, only one whale, [[Corky]], survived in captivity for more than 2 years. Spong spent three decades trying to free her.<br/>-<br/>-==Hanson Island==<br/>-In the summer of [[1972]], Dr. Paul Spong moved to [[Hanson Island]] and established the OrcaLab. The lab was located 200 miles northeast of Vancouver in a quite bay where orcas retreat to in the summer to feed and give birth. Hanson Island was an ideal place to study orcas in their natural habitat. <br/>-<br/>-At the laboratory, Dr. Spong started to catalogue and transcribed the modulations and songs sung by the whales in order to decipher them. <br/>+The '''Serie A 2006-07''' season, while originally scheduled to start around the end of August 2006, will now start on September 10 due to the [[Serie A scandal of 2006|2006 Calciopoli Scandal]].<br/>+<br/>+Initially, [[Juventus F.C.]], [[ACF Fiorentina]] and [[S.S.

Messina Peloro]] and [[Treviso F.B.C. 1993]], originally slated for relegation to Serie B, were to have been retained in [[Serie A]] to keep the table at 20 teams. <br/>+<br/>+As a result of the appeals lodged by Fiorentina, Juventus, Lazio and Milan, Fiorentina and Lazio have been reinstated to the Serie A but with 19 points and 11 points deductions for each team respectively. Milan's points reduction was reduced to only 8 points. Juventus will remain relegated to Serie B with a points deduction of 17.  Lecce and Treviso return to Serie B, while Messina provisionally remains in Serie A to replace Juventus, pending further appeals.<br/>+<br/>+As part of another inquiry, [[Reggina Calcio]] were handed a 15-point penalty, but were allowed to remain in Serie A. <ref name="reggina3">[http://www.theworldgame.com.au/home/index.php?pid=st&cid=74227 "Reggina to stay in Serie A"], ''The World Game'', 18 August 2006.</ref> The inquiry is continuing to investigate Messina, Lecce, [[A.C.

Many of his principle works can be found in the area in and around [[Catania]].<br/>-<br/>-==Biography==<br/>-Vaccarini was born in [[Palermo]].<br/>-During the 1720s he studied architecture in [[Rome]], under the protection of [[Pietro, Cardinal Ottoboni]], the great patron of [[Arcangelo Corelli|Corelli]]. Vaccarini's  studies concentrated mainly on the combined works and idioms of the great architects [[Borromini]] and [[Bernini]].  This was a popular fusion of architectural principles which had begun at the end of the 17th century, producing such notable buildings as [[Giovanni de' Rossi]]'s Palazzo Altieri, and Palazzo Asti-Bonaparte.<br/>-<br/>-[[Image:Catane duomo.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Catania]] duomo. Vaccarini's principal façade.]]<br/>-<br/>-Vaccarini returned to Sicily around 1730.  His work seems then to have been influenced by the school of architecture of [[Alessandro Specchi]], [[Francesco de Sanctis]] and [[Filippo Raguzzini]], who tended to reject the classicizing of buildings in favour of a much more flamboyant style full of movement.  Both Specchi and de Sanctis were closely involved with the design of exterior staircases, a great feature of Italian buildings due to the principal rooms being nearly always on the [[piano nobile]], and of course the climate completely negating the requirement for an internal entrance hall on the ground floor in order to provide quick easy access.  De Sanctis had taken this feature one step further in 1723 with his design for the [[Spanish steps]] in Rome.  This grand staircase approach to a building was to be invaluable in Sicily, not only for the practical reasons of entering the piano nobile, but also for the creation of a grand approach to churches and cathedrals, where the topography of the site necessitate such a feature.<br/>-<br/>-Vaccarini's work in Sicily can be observed most clearly in the Municipio of Catania on the Cathedral Square.  The ground floor (already under construction when Vaccarini assumed the project) shows the decorated [[rustication (architecture)|rustication]] in the Sicilian fashion, originating from the 16th century.  But Vaccarini's upper floors are in a style quite different.  The ground floor pilasters continue but unrusticated, the [[cornice]] they support is entirely in accordance with Roman contemporary design, as are the windows.  The windows on the piano nobile have straight, but broken, pediments with canted sides.  This was a window feature which Vaccarini was to reproduce many times in the ensuing years.  The entrance is given an almost pompous grandeur by free standing columns supporting a straight balcony.  The balcony was to become a feature of Sicilian Baroque, it was later to take many shapes, often curved, serpentine, or a combination of both juxtaposing.  Such balconies were often decorated by elaborate wrought iron balustrading.<br/>-<br/>-In front of this building Vaccarini designed a fountain, of an [[obelisk]] upon the back of the Catanian elephant, itself a remnant of Bernini's fountains.  Vacacrini completed the square by designing the main facade of the cathedral, a thirty year project not completed until 1768.  According to Professor Anthony Blunt, the cathedral was not one of Vaccarini's successes.<br/>-<br/>-As a church architect Vaccarini introduced into Sicily the church plans of the [[Renaissance]] which had passed Sicily by.  However many of his churches are based on the designs of churches he had seen in Rome.  The church of S. Agata in Catania, for instance, is based on [[Sant'Agnese in Agone]] (Rome).<br/>-<br/>-Vaccarini's version of Baroque was prevalent in Catania, and much copied for three quarters of a century.  However e was not merely employed in the redevelopment of Sicily. In 1756 he journeyed to [[Naples]] where he was involved in the marble selection for the great [[Palace of Caserta]].  It is on this trip that he became aware of the work of [[Vanvitelli]] and [[Ferdinando Fuga]], taking their ideas back to Sicily. Vanvitelli's influence is clearly visible in his final works, especially the [[Collegio Cutelli]] and the [[Piccola Badia]].<br/>-<br/>-Vaccarini died in Palermo in 1768.<br/>-<br/>-==Analysis==<br/>-<br/>-Vaccarini is notable today for his input into the development of Sicilian Baroque. While much of his work was later overshadowed by a younger generation of Sicilian architects, he was one of the founding architects of the style; in particular his handling of the Baroque double staircase, which continued to evolve, in a way peculiar to Sicily, after his death.<br/>-<br/>-[[Category:1702 births|Vaccarini, Giovanni]]<br/>-[[Category:1768 deaths|Vaccarini, Giovanni]]<br/>-[[Category:Natives of Palermo|Vaccarini, Giovanni]]<br/>-[[Category:Italian architects|Vaccarini, Giovanni]]<br/>-[[Category:Architects of the Sicilian Baroque|Vaccarini, Giovanni Battista]]<br/>-<br/>-[[es:Giovanni Battista Vaccarini]]<br/>-[[fr:Giovanni Battista Vaccarini]]<br/>-[[it:Giovanni Battista Vaccarini]]<br/>+{{Unreferenced}}<br/>+{{Infobox_Country<br/>+|native_name = ''República de Costa Rica''<br/>+|conventional_long_name = Republic of Costa Rica<br/>+|common_name = Costa Rica<br/>+|image_flag = Flag of Costa Rica (state).svg<br/>+|image_coat = Costa_rica_coa.png<br/>+|image_map = LocationCostaRica.png<br/>+|national_motto = "¡Vivan siempre el trabajo y la paz!"<br/>+"Live forever work and peace!"

Costa Rica was the first country in the world to constitutionally [[Military of Costa Rica|abolish its army]].<br/>+<br/>+==History of Costa Rica==<br/>+In [[Pre-Columbian]] times the [[Indigenous]] people in what is now known as Costa Rica were part of the [[Intermediate Area]] located between the [[Mesoamerican]] and [[Andean]] cultural regions. This has recently been updated to include the influence of the [[Isthmo-Colombian]] area in the south-Atlantic region of the country, defined by the presence of groups that spoke [[Chibchan languages]]. It is still unknown if any of these groups created the famous [[stone spheres of Costa Rica]], between 200 BC and AD 1600.<br/>+[[Image:NicoyaCeramics.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Pre-Columbian ceramics from Nicoya, Costa Rica]]<br/>+<br/>+===Conquest===<br/>+The country was visited by [[Christopher Columbus]] in [[1502]], during his fourth expedition. He arrived at Cariay, in front of the Quiribrí island (present day Isla Uvita). The subsequent conquest and colonization of the area was complicated by its distance and the fierce indigenous resistance, however it paled in comparison to the [[Spanish conquest of Mexico]].<br/>+<br/>+During the 16th century the area found itself with a quickly diminishing workforce. The [[indigenous]] population, slaves at the time, were falling ill to many of the diseases brought by the colonists, or dying in resistance battles. Also, the lack of abundant mineral resources and the fact that the richest soils were found deep in the heart of the country (the Central Valley) severely hindered the colonization effort. All these circumstances made Costa Rica, the southernmost province in the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]], the poorest and most irrelevant region. However the colonizers that braved the hard trip in the Central Valley had established a provincial capital [[Cartago, Costa Rica|Cartago]].<br/>+<br/>+===Independence===<br/>+In 1821, the winds of independence had blown in from the north. The [[United States|United States of America]] and [[Mexico]] had won their independence recently and in the capital of the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]], Guatemala City, protests broke out demanding independence. On September 15th, 1821 they declared their independence from the [[Spanish Empire]]. At the time, several present-day Mexican states and most of the Central American countries belonged to the Captaincy, so in order to send the news to all the states, a horse messenger was sent down through Central America.<br/>+<br/>+Because Costa Rica was the southernmost province, it finally received the news of its independence on October 13th, 1821. The fact that not a single gunshot was fired to obtain its independence marked Costa Rica as a peace-loving nation. Among the independence documents received from Guatemala there was a document prepared in Nicaragua. This document is called "Los Nublados del Dia" which means the "Clouds of the Day". In this document the Nicaraguan government, which was far more developed at the time and therefore closer to colonial rule, insisted that the states should not jump into independence and should wait for the "clouds of the day" to disperse before the states should make a final decision. However, because this document only reached Costa Rica, it had little effect.<br/>+<br/>+After gaining independence, Costa Rica, along with the other provinces of the Captaincy, briefly joined the Mexican Empire of [[Agustín de Iturbide]]. But because of the distance to the Mexican capital and other underlying conflicts, the Central American states including Costa Rica became federal states of the [[United Provinces of Central America]] (''see:'' [[History of Central America]]) from [[1823]] to [[1839]]. In [[1838]] Costa Rica proclaimed itself a sovereign and independent nation, under the rule of [[Braulio Carrillo Colina]].<br/>+<br/>+In [[1856]] the Costa Rican army, commanded by [[Juan Rafael Mora Porras]] joined forces with the other Central American nations to expell a [[filibuster (military)|filibuster]] invasion, commanded by [[William_Walker_(soldier)|William Walker]]. In the battles of Santa Rosa, Rivas and the San Juan campaign, the filibuster army was deterred from invading Costa Rica. In the Battle of Rivas, [[Juan Santamaría]] bravely set on fire the place where the invaders had taken refuge and thus became Costa Rica's National Hero.<br/>+<br/>+===20th Century===<br/>+Costa Rica has avoided the violence that has plagued Central America; it is seen as an example of political stability in the region. Since the late 19th century only two brief periods of violence have marred its democratic development.<br/>+<br/>+In [[1949]] [[José Figueres Ferrer]] abolished the [[army]]; making Costa Rica the first country ever to operate within the democratic system without the assistance of a military (an example that was later followed by other nations such as [[Panama]] after the American invasion of 1989 to oust General [[Manuel Noriega]]).<br/>+<br/>+Costa Rica (Spanish for "Rich Coast"), was a largely agricultural country. However, during the last few decades, Costa Rica has achieved a relatively high standard of living. [[Electronics]] and [[Software Development]] are rapidly expanding industries, and along with tourism, serve as the major industries of the country thanks to its social stability and rich natural environment*[http://www.estadonacion.or.cr/Info2004/Paginas/oportunidades.html].<br/>+<br/>+Below: facilities of Ad Astra Rocket, a plasma rocket development company founded by Costa Rican astronaut Franklin Chang Diaz *[http://www.nacion.com/ln_ee/2006/julio/22/economia4.html].<br/>+<br/>+==Geography==<br/>+[[Image:Costa Rica map.png|200px|thumb|right|Map of Costa Rica.]]<br/>+{{main|Geography of Costa Rica}}<br/>+<br/>+Costa Rica is located on the [[Central America]]n [[isthmus]], 10° North of the [[equator]] and 84° West of the [[Prime Meridian]]. It borders both the [[Caribbean Sea]] (to the east) and the [[Pacific Ocean|North Pacific Ocean]] (to the west), with a total of 1,290 kilometres (802&nbsp;[[mile|mi]]) of coastline (212&nbsp;km / 132&nbsp;mi on the Caribbean coast and 1,016&nbsp;km / 631&nbsp;mi on the Pacific).<br/>+<br/>+Costa Rica also borders [[Nicaragua]] to the north (309&nbsp;km / 192&nbsp;mi of border) and [[Panama]] to the south-southeast (639&nbsp;km / 397&nbsp;mi of border). In total, Costa Rica comprises 51,100 square kilometers (19,730 [[square mile|sq.&nbsp;mi]]) plus 589.000 square kilometers of [[territorial waters]].<br/>+<br/>+The highest point in the country is [[Cerro Chirripó]], with 3,810 [[metre]]s (12,500 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]]), and is the fifth highest peak in Central America. The highest volcano in the country is the [[Irazú Volcano]] (3,431&nbsp;m or 11,257&nbsp;ft). The largest lake in Costa Rica is [[Lake Arenal]].<br/>+<br/>+Costa Rica also comprises several islands. [[Cocos Island]] stands out because of its distance from continental landmass (24&nbsp;km² or 9.25&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi, 500&nbsp;km or 310&nbsp;mi from [[Puntarenas]] coast), but [[Calero Island]] is the biggest island of the country (151.6&nbsp;km² or 58.5&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi).<br/>+<br/>+Costa Rica protects over 25% of its national territory within national parks.

It is seen as one of the most stable countries in Latin America. Costa Rica has avoided the violence that has plagued Central America; it is seen as an example of political stability in the region, and is referred to as the "Switzerland of the Americas" {{citation needed}}. Executive responsibilities are vested in a [[List of Presidents of Costa Rica|president]], who is the country's center of power. There also are two vice presidents and a cabinet designated by the president. The president, vice presidents, and 57 [[Legislative Assembly of Costa Rica|Legislative Assembly]] deputies are elected for 4-year terms. A constitutional amendment approved in 1969 limited presidents and deputies to one term, although a deputy may run again for an Assembly seat after sitting out a term. An amendment to the constitution to allow second presidential terms was proposed and also the constitutionality of the prohibition against a second presidential term has been challenged in the courts. In April 2003 the prohibition was officially recognized, in a highly polemic resolution, as anti-constitutional allowing [[Óscar Arias]] ([[Nobel Peace Prize]], 1987) to run for President a second time in the 2006 elections and winning them on a very tight elections. Arias is a promoter of free trade and supports the free trade agreement with the United States which is the source of a great controversy that might develop in protests around the country in the upcoming months. Costa Rica uses a form of [[proportional representation]] to elect its national legislative body.<br/>+<br/>+Governors appointed by the president head the country's seven provinces, but they exercise little power. There are no provincial legislatures. Autonomous state agencies enjoy considerable operational independence; they include the telecommunications and electrical power monopoly, the nationalized commercial banks, the state insurance monopoly, and the social security agency.

Costa Rica's location in the [[Central America]]n [[isthmus]] provides easy access to American markets as it has the same time zone as the central part of the United States and direct ocean access to Europe and Asia.<br/>+<br/>+The economy has been expanding for Costa Rica in part because the Government had implemented a seven year plan of expansion in the high tech industry. The central government offers tax exemptions for those who are willing to invest in the country. High levels of education among its residents make the country an attractive investing location.  Several global high tech corporations have already started developing in the area exporting goods including chip manufacturer Intel and pharmaceutical companies such as Procter & Gamble and Glaxo Smith Kline. Trade with South East Asia and Russia has boomed during 2004 and 2005, and the country is expected to obtain full Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum (APEC) membership by 2007 (the country became an observer in 2004).<br/>+<br/>+For the fiscal year 2005 the country showed a government deficit of 2.1%, internal revenue increased an 18%, exports increased a 12.8% and the number of visiting tourists increased a 19%, reaching 1.5 million people. Revised economic figures released by the Central Bank indicate that economic growth stood at 5 %, nevertheless the country faced high inflation (14%) and a trade deficit of 5.2%. For 2006 the economy is expected to grow a 6.8%   <br/>+<br/>+The unit of [[currency]] is the [[Costa Rican colón|colón]] ([[CRC]]), which trades around 500 to the [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]]; currently about 600 to the [[euro]]. For 2007 a new currency exchange system will allow the value of the CRC colón to float between two bands as done previously by Chile. The idea is that by doing so the Central Bank will be able to better tackle inflation and discourage the use of the US greenback.<br/>+<br/>+==Foreign affairs==<br/>+Costa Rica is an active member of the [[United Nations]], the [[Organization of the American States]] and many international organizations related to [[human rights]] and [[democracy]]. <br/>+<br/>+Costa Rica's main foreign policy objective is to foster human rights and sustainable development as a way to secure stability and growth.<br/>+<br/>+Costa Rica is also a member of the [[International Criminal Court]], without a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the [[United States|US]]-military (as covered under [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Article 98]])<br/>+<br/>+==Flora and Fauna==<br/>+[[image:Anhinga b.jpg|left|thumb|[[Anhinga]] drying its feathers.]]<br/>+<br/>+Costa Rica is home to a rich variety of [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s.

The majority of people in Costa Rica are descended from Spanish settlers. In contrast to its neighboring populations, little mixing of the Spanish settlers and the indigenous populations occurred. Therefore, a vast majority of Costa Ricans are either of Spanish or to a lesser extent of mixed mestizo heritage. In addition, there are significant numbers of Costa Ricans of Italian, German, Jewish, and Polish descent. Together, European and Mestizos descendants make up a full 94% of the population. Less than 3% of the population is of black African descent who are called Afro-Costa Ricans and a few are of English-speaking descendants of 19th-century black [[Jamaican]] immigrant workers. Another 1% is composed of [[Overseas Chinese|ethnic Chinese]].<br/>+<br/>+As of today, the indigenous population numbers around 1.7%, or around 50000 individuals. In [[Guanacaste Province]], a significant portion of the population descends from a mix of local Amerindians, Africans and Spaniards.

"Tico" comes from the locally popular usage of "tico" diminutive suffixes (eg. 'momentico' instead of 'momentito'). The ''tico'' ideal is that of a very friendly, helpful, laid back, unhurried, educated and environmentally aware people, with little worry for deadlines or the "normal" stresses of United States life. Visitors from the United States are often referred to as ''gringos'', which is virtually always congenial in nature. The phrase "Pura Vida" (literally pure life) is a motto ubiquitous in Costa Rica. It encapsulates the pervading ideology of living in peace in a calm, unflustered manner, appreciating a life surrounded by nature and family and friends.<br/>+<br/>+Some folk might use maje or ''mae'' (sort of slang for "man" or "dude", actually ''maje'' means "dumb") to refer to each other although this might be slightly insulting to other folk.<br/>+<br/>+Costa Rican traditions and culture tend to retain a strong degree of Spanish influence. Their spoken accent is rather different than its Central American counterparts. The a -SH sound added at the end of certain words and normally -tico is added to many words to sound more polite and courteous. Costa Rica boasts a varied history. Costa Rica was the point where the Mesoamerican and South American native cultures met. The northwest of the country, Nicoya, was the southernmost point of [[Nahuatl]] cultural influence when the Spanish conquerors ([[conquistadores]]) came in the 16th century. The center and southern portions of the country had [[Chibcha]] influences. However, the indigenous people have influenced modern Costa Rican culture to a relatively small degree, as most of the Indians died from disease and mistreatment by the Spaniards. The Atlantic coast, meanwhile, was populated with African slaves in the 17th and 18th centuries, although most Caribbean Costa Ricans of African ascent descend from Jamaican workers brought in during the 19th century to work in the construction of railways connecting the urban populations of the Central Plateau to the port of [[Limon]] on the Caribbean coast. During the 19th century Chinese and Italian immigrants came to the country to work on the construction of the railroad system as well.<br/>+<br/>+==See also==<br/>+*[[Climate of Costa Rica]]<br/>+*[[Culture of Costa Rica]]<br/>+*[[Communications in Costa Rica]]<br/>+*[[Cuisine of Costa Rica]]<br/>+*[[Demographics of Costa Rica]]<br/>+*[[Economy of Costa Rica]]<br/>+*[[Foreign relations of Costa Rica]]<br/>+*[[Geography of Costa Rica]]<br/>+*[[History of Costa Rica]]<br/>+*[[List of Presidents of Costa Rica]]<br/>+*[[Media of Costa Rica]]<br/>+*[[Military of Costa Rica]]<br/>+*[[Museums of Costa Rica]]<br/>+*[[Music of Costa Rica]]<br/>+*[[Politics of Costa Rica]]<br/>+*[[Transportation in Costa Rica]]<br/>+*[[Rail transport in Costa Rica]]<br/>+*[[Costa Rica national football team]]<br/>+*[[Universities in Costa Rica]]<br/>+*[[Asociación de Guías y Scouts de Costa Rica]]<br/>+*[[Central America]]<br/>+*[[South America]]<br/>+<br/>+<br/>+<br/>+==External links==<br/>+; Government and administration<br/>+* [http://www.casapres.go.cr Casa Presidencial] {{es_icon}} Official presidential site.<br/>+* [http://www.inbio.ac.cr/en/default.html Instituto Nacional de Biodiversidad], National Biodiversity Institute.<br/>+<br/>+; Local Newspaper<br/>+* [http://www.nacion.co.cr La Nacion] {{es_icon}} La Nacion.<br/>+<br/>+;Travel & Tourism<br/>+* [http://wikitravel.org/en/Costa_Rica Costa Rica Travel Guide], Powered by Wikitravel.<br/>+<br/>+;{{Central America}}<br/>+{{North_America}}<br/>+<br/>+[[Category:Central American countries]]<br/>+[[Category:Costa Rica|Costa Rica]]<br/>+[[Category:Spanish-speaking countries]]<br/>+<br/>+[[ar:كوستاريكا]]<br/>+[[an:Costa Rica]]<br/>+[[az:Kosta Rika]]<br/>+[[bn:কোস্টা রিকা]]<br/>+[[zh-min-nan:Costa Rica]]<br/>+[[bs:Kostarika]]<br/>+[[bg:Коста Рика]]<br/>+[[ca:Costa Rica]]<br/>+[[cs:Kostarika]]<br/>+[[cy:Costa Rica]]<br/>+[[da:Costa Rica]]<br/>+[[de:Costa Rica]]<br/>+[[et:Costa Rica]]<br/>+[[el:Κόστα Ρίκα]]<br/>+[[es:Costa Rica]]<br/>+[[eo:Kostariko]]<br/>+[[eu:Costa Rica]]<br/>+[[fa:کاستاریکا]]<br/>+[[fr:Costa Rica]]<br/>+[[ga:Cósta Ríce]]<br/>+[[gl:Costa Rica]]<br/>+[[ko:코스타리카]]<br/>+[[hy:Կոստա Րիկա]]<br/>+[[hr:Kostarika]]<br/>+[[io:Kosta Rika]]<br/>+[[id:Kosta Rika]]<br/>+[[is:Kosta Ríka]]<br/>+[[it:Costa Rica]]<br/>+[[he:קוסטה ריקה]]<br/>+[[kw:Kosta Rika]]<br/>+[[ht:Kostarika]]<br/>+[[la:Ora Opulenta]]<br/>+[[lv:Kostarika]]<br/>+[[lt:Kosta Rika]]<br/>+[[hu:Costa Rica]]<br/>+[[mk:Костарика]]<br/>+[[ms:Costa Rica]]<br/>+[[na:Costa Rica]]<br/>+[[nl:Costa Rica]]<br/>+[[ja:コスタリカ]]<br/>+[[no:Costa Rica]]<br/>+[[nn:Costa Rica]]<br/>+[[oc:Còsta Rica]]<br/>+[[ug:كوستارىكا]]<br/>+[[pam:Costa Rica]]<br/>+[[ps:کوسټاريکا]]<br/>+[[nds:Costa Rica]]<br/>+[[pl:Kostaryka]]<br/>+[[pt:Costa Rica]]<br/>+[[ro:Costa Rica]]<br/>+[[ru:Коста-Рика]]<br/>+[[sa:कोस्टा रीका]]<br/>+[[sq:Kosta Rika]]<br/>+[[scn:Costa Rica]]<br/>+[[simple:Costa Rica]]<br/>+[[sk:Kostarika]]<br/>+[[sl:Kostarika]]<br/>+[[sr:Костарика]]<br/>+[[sh:Kostarika]]<br/>+[[fi:Costa Rica]]<br/>+[[sv:Costa Rica]]<br/>+[[tl:Costa Rica]]<br/>+[[th:สาธารณรัฐคอสตาริกา]]<br/>+[[vi:Costa Rica]]<br/>+[[tr:Kosta Rika]]<br/>+[[uk:Коста-Рика]]<br/>+[[uz:Kosta Rika]]<br/>+[[vo:Kostarikän]]<br/>+[[zh:哥斯达黎加]]</td>

It is also commonly referred to as the '''East Asian currency crisis''' or locally as the '''IMF crisis''' although the latter is somewhat controversial.<br/>+{{TOCleft}}<br/>+[[Indonesia]], [[South Korea]] and [[Thailand]] were the countries most affected by the crisis. [[Hong Kong]], [[Malaysia]], [[Laos]] and the [[Philippines]] were also hit by the slump. [[Mainland China]], [[Republic of China|Taiwan]], [[Singapore]] and [[Vietnam]] were relatively unaffected.  [[Japan]] was not affected much by this crisis but was going through its own long-term economic difficulties.  However, all nations mentioned above saw their currencies dip significantly relative to the US dollar, though the harder hit nations saw extended currency losses.<br/> <br/>-==Latter-day Saints in Selbongen==<br/>-This small village occupies a disproportionately prominent place, compared to its size, in the history of The [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] in Europe, since it was here that the first meeting-house of the Church in continental Europe was built, in [[1929]]. Selbongen was then part of [[Germany]], in an area known as [[East Prussia]].<br/>+Though called the "East Asian" crisis because it originated in [[East Asia]], its effects rippled throughout the globe and caused a global financial crisis, with major effects felt as widely as [[Russia]], [[Brazil]], as investors lost confidence in [[emerging markets]].  [[United States]] as an investor was briefly affected.<br/> <br/>-An inhabitant of Selbongen had been converted to the Church in the early [[1920s]], and had introduced the Church to his family and neighbours, many of whom later also joined the Church. The branch in Selbongen had several hundred members at its largest: more than half of the inhabitants of the village.<br/>+== History and causes ==<br/>+Until 1997, Asia attracted almost half of total capital inflow to [[developing countries]].  The economies of [[Southeast Asia]] in particular maintained high [[interest rates]] attractive to foreign investors looking for a high rate of return.  As a result the region's economies received a large inflow of [[hot money]] and experienced a dramatic run-up in asset prices.  At the same time, the regional economies of [[Thailand]], [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], the [[Philippines]], [[Singapore]], and [[South Korea]] experienced high, 8-12% GDP growth rates in the late [[1980s]] and early [[1990s]].  This achievement was broadly acclaimed by economic institutions including the [[IMF]] and [[World Bank]], and was known as part of the [[Asian economic miracle]]. <br/> <br/>-When parts of Germany were given to Poland after [[World War II]], including the area around Selbongen, the local branch there remained active, the only unit of the Church in Poland at the time. Services continued to be held in [[German language|German]] until this practice was forbidden by the Polish government in [[1947]].<br/>+Whatever the disputed causes, the Asian crisis started in mid-1997 and affected currencies, stock markets, and other asset prices of several Southeast Asian economies.  Triggered by events in Latin America, particularly after the [[The December Mistake|Mexican peso crisis]] of 1994, Western investors lost confidence in securities in East Asia and began to pull money out, creating a snowball effect. <br/> <br/>-Most of the members who had not died in the war or [[German exodus from Eastern Europe|emigrated shortly afterwards]] left in the succeeding years, due to the poor economic conditions in the area. The Zełwągi branch was eventually closed in [[1971]] due to the declining membership numbers; there are currently no members of the church there. Many of the members who left Selbongen proved to be staunch supporters of the wards where they moved to.<br/>+In 1994, [[Princeton University]] (then [[MIT]]) [[economist]] [[Paul Krugman]] published an article attacking the idea of an Asian economic miracle. [http://web.mit.edu/krugman/www/myth.html] He argued that East Asia's economic growth had historically been the result of capital investment, leading to growth in [[productivity]]. However, [[total factor productivity]] had increased only marginally or not at all. Krugman argued that only growth in total factor productivity, and not capital investment, could lead to long-term prosperity. Krugman would be seen by many as prescient after the financial crisis became full-blown, though he himself stated that he had not predicted the crisis or foreseen its depth.<br/> <br/>-It was not until [[1977]] that the Church was officially recognised in Poland and branches began to be organised in other parts of the country.<br/>+At the time Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea had large private [[current account]] deficits and the maintenance of [[pegged exchange rate]]s encouraged external borrowing and led to excessive exposure to foreign exchange risk in both the financial and corporate sectors. In the mid-1990s, two factors began to change their economic environment. As the [[U.S.]] economy recovered from a recession in the early 1990s, the [[U.S. Federal Reserve Bank]] under [[Alan Greenspan]] began to raise U.S. interest rates to head off inflation. This made the U.S. a more attractive investment destination relative to Southeast Asia, which had attracted hot money flows through high short-term interest rates, and raised the value of the U.S. dollar, to which many Southeast Asian nations' currencies were pegged, thus making their exports less competitive. At the same time, Southeast Asia's export growth slowed dramatically in the spring of 1996, deteriorating their current account position. <br/>+<br/>+Some economists have advanced the impact of Mainland China on the [[real economy]] as a contributing factor to their [[ASEAN]] nations' export growth slowdown, though these economists maintain the main cause of the crises was excessive real estate speculation. China had begun to compete effectively with other Asian exporters particularly in the 1990s after the implementation of a number of export-oriented reforms. Most importantly, the Thai and Indonesian currencies were [[fixed exchange rate|closely tied]] to the dollar, which was appreciating in the 1990s. Western importers sought cheaper manufacturers and found them, indeed, in China whose currency was depreciated relative to the dollar. Other economists dispute this claim noting that both ASEAN and China experienced simultaneous rapid export growth in the early 1990s.<br/>+<br/>+Many economists, like those within the [[Cato Institute]], believed that the Asian crisis was created not by market psychology or technology (which actually represents a more efficient form of capitalism through the ability to acquire information cheaply and more quickly) but by macroeconomic policies that distorted information which in turn created the volatility that attracted speculators.  What some have called "[[herd mentality]]" was merely the result of speculators behaving rationally, noting the currency policies (The government defending the fixed exchange rate) which speculators assumed could not be sustained.  Such economists believe that this crisis was the result of unsustainable macroeconomic/protectionist policies which create the very "market" imperfections they were originally designed to correct.<br/>+<br/>+Other economists, including [[Joseph Stiglitz]] and [[Jeffrey Sachs]], have downplayed the role of the real economy in the crisis compared to the financial markets due to the speed of the crisis. The rapidity with which the crisis happened has prompted Sachs and others to compare it to a classic [[bank run]] prompted by a sudden [[risk shock]]. Sachs points to strict monetary and contractory fiscal policies implemented by the governments at the advice of the IMF in the wake of the crisis, while [[Frederic Mishkin]] points to the role of [[asymmetric information]] in the financial markets that led to a "herd mentality" among investors that magnified a relatively small risk in the real economy. The crisis has thus attracted interest from [[behavioral economics|behavioral economists]] interested in [[market psychology]].<br/>+<br/>+The foreign ministers of the 10 ASEAN countries believed that the well co-ordinated manipulation of currencies was a deliberate attempt to destabilise the ASEAN economies. Malaysian Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohamad]] accused currency speculator [[George Soros]] of ruining Malaysia's economy with massive [[currency speculation]]. At the 30th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting held in [[Subang Jaya]], [[Malaysia]] they issued a joint declaration on 25 July 1997 expressing serious concern and called for further intensification of ASEAN's cooperation to safeguard and promote ASEAN's interest in this regard.[http://www.aseansec.org/4010.htm] Coincidentally, on that same day, the Central Bankers of most of the affected countries were at the EMEAP (Executive Meeting of East Asia Pacific) meeting in [[Shanghai]], and they failed to make the [[New Arrangement to Borrow]] operational. A year earlier, the finance ministers of these same countries had attended the 3rd [[APEC]] finance ministers meeting in [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]] on 17 March 1996, and according to that joint declaration, they had been unable to double the amounts available under the [[General Agreement to Borrow]] and the [[Emergency Finance Mechanism]]. As such, the crisis could be seen as the failure to adequately build capacity in time, to prevent currency manipulation.<br/>+<br/>+== IMF and controversy ==<br/>+{{pov}}<br/>+{{verify}}<br/>+{{tone}}<br/>+{{globalize}}<br/>+The role of the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) was very controversial during the crisis, causing many locals to call the crisis the "IMF crisis." To begin with, many commentators in retrospect criticized the IMF for encouraging the developing economies of Asia down the path of "fast track capitalism", meaning liberalization of the financial sector (i.e. elimination of restrictions on capital flows); maintenance of high domestic interest rates in order to suck in portfolio investment and bank capital; and pegging of the national currency to the dollar to reassure foreign investors against currency [[risk]]. [http://www.ifg.org/imf_asia.html]. <br/>+<br/>+However, the greatest criticism of the IMF's role in the crisis was targeted towards its response. As country after country fell into crisis, many local businesses and governments that had taken out loans in US dollars, which suddenly became much more expensive relative to the local currency which formed their earned income, found themselves unable to pay their creditors. The dynamics in this scenario were similar to that of the [[Latin American debt crisis]]. <br/>+<br/>+In response, the IMF offered to step in the case of each nation and offer it a multi-billion dollar "rescue package" to enable these nations to avoid default. However, the IMF's support was conditional on a series of drastic economic reforms influenced by [[neoliberal]] economic principles called a [[structural adjustment]] package (SAP). The SAP's called on crisis nations to cut government spending to reduce deficits, allow insolvent banks and financial institutions to fail, and aggressively raise interest rates. The reasoning was that these steps would restore confidence in the nations' fiscal solvency, penalize insolvent companies, and protect currency values. However, the effects of the SAP's were mixed and their impact controversial. Critics, however, noted the contractionary nature of these policies, arguing that in a recession, the traditional [[Keynesian]] response is to increase government spending, prop up major companies, and lower interest rates. The reasoning was that by stimulating the economy and staving off recession, governments could restore confidence while preventing economic pain. They pointed out that the [[U.S. government]] pursued expansionary policies, such as lowering interest rates, increasing government spending, and cutting taxes, when the U.S. itself entered a recession in [[2001]].<br/>+<br/>+==Thailand==<br/>+<br/>+ [[Image:Small FX Thailand US 10yrs.png|frame|right|Exchange rate: Baht per U.S. Dollar]]  From 1985 to 1995, [[Thailand]]'s economy grew at an average of 9%.  On [[14 May]] and [[15 May]] [[1997]], the [[thai baht|baht]], the local currency, was hit by massive speculative attacks.  On [[30 June]], Prime Minister [[Chavalit Yongchaiyudh]] said that he would not [[devaluation|devalue]] the baht, but Thailand's administration eventually floated the local currency, on [[2 July]].  Opposition parties had claimed that future Thai Prime Minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]] profited from the devaluation[http://asiaviews.org/?content=153499ym32dddw4&headline=20050216191457][http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/02/13/bloomberg/sxpesek.html], although subsequent Opposition party-led governments did not investigate the issue.<br/>+<br/>+In 1996, an American [[hedge fund]] had already sold  $400 million of the Thai currency. From 1985 until [[2 July]] [[1997]], the baht was pegged at 25 to the dollar. The baht dropped very swiftly and lost half of its value.  The baht reached its lowest point of 56 to the dollar in January 1998.  The Thai stock market dropped 75% in 1997.  [[Finance One]], the largest Thai finance company collapsed.  On [[11 August]], the [[IMF]] unveiled a rescue package for Thailand with more than 16 billion dollars.  The IMF approved on [[20 August]], another bailout package of 3.9 billion dollars.  The baht has only recently in August 2006 reached pre-crisis highs of 37.3 to the dollar.<br/>+<br/>+==Philippines==<br/>+The [[Philippines]] [[central bank]] raised interest rates by 1.75 percentage points in May 1997 and again by 2 points on [[19 June]]. Thailand triggered the crisis on [[2 July]]. On [[3 July]], the Philippines central bank was forced to intervene heavily to defend the [[Philippine peso|peso]], raising the overnight rate from 15% to 24%. The peso fell significantly, from 26 pesos per dollar at the start of the crisis, to 38 pesos in 2000, to 40 pesos by the end of the crisis.<br/>+<br/>+During the tenure of former President [[Joseph Estrada]], the Philippine economy recovered from a contraction of .6 % in GDP during the worst part of the crisis to GDP growth of some 3% by 2001.  Unfortunately, scandals rocked his administration in 2001, most notably the "jueteng" scandal, became a significant factor to calls for his ouster which caused significant falls in the share prices of companies listed on the [[Philippine Stock Exchange]].  The [[PSE Composite Index]], the main index of the PSE, fell to some 1000 points from a high of some 3000 points in [[1997]].  The peso fell even further, trading from levels of about 35 pesos to 56 pesos.  Later that year, he was impeached but was not voted out of office.  Massive protests caused [[EDSA II]], which led to his resignation and lifted [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] to the Philippine presidency.  Arroyo did manage to end the crisis in the [[Philippines]], which led to the recovery of the Philippine peso to about 51 pesos by the time Arroyo became as the president.<br/>+<br/>+==Hong Kong==<br/>+The collapse of the Thai baht on July 2, 1997, came 24 hours after the United Kingdom handed over sovereignty over Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China.<br/>+In October 1997, the [[Hong Kong dollar]], which was pegged at 7.8 to the US dollar, came under speculative pressure since [[Hong Kong]]'s inflation rate was significantly higher than that of the US for years. Monetary authorities spent more than US$1 billion to defend the local currency. Since Hong Kong has more than US$80 billion of foreign reserves, which is equivalent to 700% of [[Money supply#Scope|M1]] money supply and 45% of [[Money supply#Scope|M3]] money supply of Hong Kong, [[Hong Kong]] managed to keep the currency pegged to the US dollar despite the speculative attacks. Stock markets become more and more volatile; between [[20 October]] and [[23 October]] the [[Hang Seng Index]] dipped by 23%. [[Hong Kong Monetary Authority]] promised to protect the currency. On [[15 August]] [[1998]], Hong Kong raised rates overnight from 8% to 23% and at one point, to 500%. <br/>+While the Monetary Authority recognized that the speculative forces were taking advantage of the unique currency board system, in which the overnight rates would automatically increase proportionally when the currency is sold in the market heavily, which would in turn increase the downward pressure of the stock market and thus allowing the speculators to earn a large profit by [[short selling]] shares, the Monetary Authority started buying component shares of the Heng Seng Index in mid-August. The Monetary Authority and [[Donald Tsang]], then Financial Secretary, declared war with speculators openly. The Government ended up buying approximately HK$120 billion (about US$15 billion) of shares of various companies, and becoming the largest shareholder of some of the companies (e.g. the government owned 10% of [[HSBC]]) at the end of August when hostilities ended with the closing of the August contract of Heng Seng Index Futures. The Government started to divest itself from the position in 2001 and made a profit of about HK$30 billion (about US$4 billion) in the process.<br/>+<br/>+Speculative actions against the Hong Kong Dollar and the stock market did not continue into September largely due to extraordinary reaction to speculators by the Malaysian authorities and the onset of the collapse of Russian bond and currency market, which caused massive loss to the speculators.<br/>+<br/>+The currency peg between the Hong Kong Dollar and the US Dollar at 7.8:1 continued to exist undeterred.<br/>+<br/>+==South Korea==<br/>+[[South Korea]] is the world's 10th largest economy. Macroeconomic fundamentals were good but the banking sector was burdened with non-performing loans as its large corporations were funding aggressive expansions.  Excess debt would eventually lead to major failures and take-overs. For example, in July, South Korea's third largest car maker, [[Kia Motors]] asked for emergency loans. In the wake of the Asian market downturn, [[Moody's]] lowered the [[credit rating]] of South Korea from A1 to A3, on [[November 28]], [[1997]], and downgraded again to Baa2 on [[December 11]]. That contributed to a further decline  in Korean shares since stock markets were already bearish in November. The Seoul stock exchange fell by 4% on [[7 November]] [[1997]]. On [[November 8]], it plunged  by 7% the biggest one-day drop recorded there to date. And on [[November 24]], stocks fell another 7.2% on fears that the IMF would demand tough reforms. In 1998, Hyundai Motor took over Kia Motors.  Samsung Motors' $5 billion dollar venture was dissolved due to the crisis, and eventually [[Daewoo]] Motors was sold off to [[General Motors]].<br/>+<br/>+The [[Korean won]], meanwhile plunged to less than 1700 per dollar from less than 1000, however, despite initial sharp economic slowdown and many companies going bankrupt, Korea has managed to triple its [[per capita]] GDP since the 1997 crisis to 2006 in dollar terms, continuing its growth from 1960 as the world's fastest growing economy in the period (1960-2006), per capita GDP having grown larger by 606 times from $80 capita to over $18,000.  However, like the [[chaebol]], South Korea's government didn't come out unscathed, as its national debt to GDP ratio more than tripled after the crisis.<br/>+<br/>+==Malaysia==<br/>+Pre-crisis, [[Malaysia]] had a large current account deficit of 5% of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]]. At the time, Malaysia was a top investment destination, and this was reflected in [[KLSE]] activity which was regularly the most active exchange in the world. (with turnover exceeding even markets with far higher capitalisation like the [[NYSE]]) . Expectations at the time were that the growth rate would continue, propelling Malaysia into developed status by 2020, a government policy articulated in [[Wawasan 2020]]. As at start of 1997, the KLSE [[Composite]] [[index (economics)|index]] was above 1,200, the ringgit was trading above 2.50 to the dollar, and the overnight rate was below 7%. <br/>+<br/>+In July, within days of the [[Thai baht]] devaluation, the Malaysian [[ringgit]] was "attacked" by [[speculation|speculators]]. The overnight rate jumped from under 8% to over 40%. This led to rating downgrades and a general sell off on the stock and currency markets. By end 1997, ratings had fallen many notches from investment grade to [[junk]], the KLSE had lost more than 50% from above 1,200 to under 600, and the ringgit had lost 50% of its value, falling from above 2.50 to under 3.80 to the dollar.<br/>+<br/>+In 1998, the output of the real economy declined plunging the country into its first [[recession]] for many years. The construction sector contracted 23.5%, manufacturing shrunk 9% and the agriculture sector 5.9%.  Overall, the country's gross domestic product plunged 6.2% in 1998. During the year, the ringgit plunged below 4.7 and the KLSE fell below 270. In September that year, various defensive measures were announced to overcome the crisis.  <br/>+<br/>+The principal measure taken were to move the ringgit from a free float to a fixed exchange rate regime. [[Bank Negara]] fixed the ringgit at 3.8 to the dollar. Capital controls were imposed. Various agencies were formed. The Corporate Debt Restructuring Committee dealt with corporate loans. [[Danaharta]] discounted and bought bad loans from banks to facilitate orderly asset realization. [[Danamodal]] recapitalised banks.<br/>+<br/>+Growth then settled at a slower but more sustainable pace. The massive current account deficit became a fairly substantial surplus. Banks were better capitalised and NPLs were realised in an orderly way. Small banks were bought out by strong ones. A large number of PLCs were unable to regularise their financial affairs and were de listed.<br/>+<br/>+Asset values however, have not returned to their pre crisis highs.<br/>+<br/>+In 2005 the last of the crisis measures was removed as the ringgit was taken off the fixed exchange system. But unlike pre-crisis days, it does not appear to be a free float, but a dirty managed float, like the Singapore dollar.<br/>+<br/>+==Indonesia==<br/>+{{see|Reformation (Indonesia)}}<br/>+<br/>+In June 1997, [[Indonesia]] seemed far from crisis.  Unlike Thailand, Indonesia had low inflation, a trade surplus of more than $900 million, huge foreign exchange reserves of more than $20 billion , and a good banking sector.<br/>+<br/>+But a large number of Indonesian corporations had been borrowing in U.S. dollars. During preceding years, as the [[rupiah]] had strengthened respective to the dollar, this practice had worked well for those corporations -- their effective levels of debt and financing costs had decreased as the local currency's value rose.  <br/>+<br/>+In July, when Thailand floated the baht, Indonesia's monetary authorities widened the rupiah trading band from 8% to 12%.  The rupiah came under severe attack in August.  On [[14 August]] [[1997]], the managed floating exchange regime was replaced by a free-floating exchange rate arrangement. The rupiah dropped further. The IMF came forward with a rescue package of $23 billion, but the rupiah was sinking further amid fears over corporate debts, massive selling of rupiah, strong demand for dollars. The rupiah and Jakarta Stock Exchange touched a new historic low in September. Moody's eventually downgraded Indonesia's long-term debt to junk bond.  <br/>+<br/>+Although the rupiah crisis began in July and August, it intensified in November when the effects of that summer devaluation showed up on corporate balance sheets.  Companies that had borrowed in dollars had to face the higher costs imposed upon them by the rupiah's decline, and many reacted by buying dollars, i.e. selling rupiah, undermining the value of the latter further. <br/>+<br/>+The inflation of the rupiah and the resulting steep hikes in the prices of food staples led to riots throughout the country in which more than 500 people died alone in [[Jakarta]].  In February 1998, President [[Suharto]] sacked the governor of Bank Indonesia, but this proved insufficient.  Suharto was forced to resign in mid-1998 and [[B. J. Habibie]] became President.<br/>+<br/>+Before the crisis, the exchange rate between the [[rupiah]] and the dollar was roughly 2000 rupiah to 1 USD. The rate had plunged to over 18000 rupiah to 1 USD at times during the crisis. <br/>+<br/>+Indonesia lost 13.5% of its GDP that year.<br/>+<br/>+==Singapore==<br/>+<br/>+The [[Economy of Singapore|Singaporean economy]] dipped into a short recession almost purely as a result of contagion. The relatively short duration and milder effects can be credited to active management by the government. For example, the [[Monetary Authority of Singapore]] allowed for a gradual 20% depreciation of the [[Singapore dollar]] to cushion and guide the economy to a soft landing. The timing of government programmes such as the [[Interim Upgrading Program]] and other construction related projects were brought forward. Instead of allowing the labor markets to work, the [[National Wage Council]] pre-emptively agreed to [[CPF]] (Central Provident Fund, the Singapore's mandatory saving and social security plan) cuts to lower labor costs, with limited impact on disposable income and local demand. Unlike in [[Hong Kong]], no attempt was made to directly intervene in the capital markets, and the Straits Times index was allowed to drop 60%. <br/>+<br/>+In less than a year, the Singapore economy recovered, and continued on its growth trajectory.<br/>+<br/>+Needless to say, the economic effects, although collectively much milder than in other economies, were, in absolute terms, still very devastating, to those badly affected.<br/>+<br/>+==People's Republic of China==<br/>+The Chinese currency, [[renminbi]] (RMB), had been pegged to the US dollar at a ratio of 8.3 RMB to the dollar, in 1994. Throughout 1998 there was heavy speculation in the [[Western world|Western]] [[news|press]] that China would soon be forced to devalue its currency to protect the competitiveness of Chinese exports vis-a-vis those of ASEAN nations, whose exports became cheaper relative to China's. However, the RMB's non-convertibility protected its value from currency speculators, and the decision was made to maintain the peg of the currency, improving the country's standing within Asia. The currency peg was partly scrapped in July [[2005]] rising (only) 2.3 % against the dollar, reflecting pressure from the United States.<br/>+<br/>+Unlike investments of many of the Southeast Asian nations, almost all of its foreign investment took the form of factories on the ground rather than securities, which insulated the country from rapid [[capital flight]]. While the PRC was relatively unaffected by the crisis compared to Southeast Asia and Korea, GDP growth slowed sharply in 1998 and 1999, calling attention to  structural problems with the PRC economy.  In particular, the Asian financial crisis convinced the Chinese government of the need to resolve the issue of non-performing loans within the banking system.  <br/>+<br/>+Although most of the deposits in PRC banks are domestic and there was not a run on the banks, there was a fear within the Chinese government that weak banks would cause a future crisis lead to a scenario similar to the fall of [[Suharto]] in which the [[Communist Party of China]] would be overthrown.  This led to measures to fix the banks and the industrial enterprises, which were largely complete by 2005.<br/>+<br/>+==The United States and Japan==<br/>+The "Asian flu" also put pressure on  the [[United States]] and [[Japan]].  Their economies did not collapse, but they were severely hit.<br/>+<br/>+On [[27 October]] [[1997]], the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average|Dow Jones]] industrial plunged  554-points, or 7.2%, amid ongoing worries about the Asian economies. The [[New York Stock Exchange]] briefly suspended trading. The crisis led to a drop in [[consumer confidence|consumer]] and spending [[confidence]] (see [[October 27, 1997 mini-crash]]).<br/>+<br/>+[[Japan]] was affected because its economy is prominent in the region.  Asian countries usually run a [[trade deficit]] with Japan because the latter's economy was more than twice the size of the rest of Asia together.  The Japanese yen fell to 147 as mass selling began, but Japan was the world's largest holder of currency reserves at the time, so it was easily defended, and quickly bounced back.  About 40% of Japan's exports go to Asia. GDP real growth rate slowed dramatically in 1997, from 5% to 1.6% and even sank into recession in 1998.  The Asian financial crisis also led to more bankruptcies in Japan.  In addition, with South Korea's devalued currency, and China's steady gains, many companies complained outright they could not compete.<br/>+<br/>+==Consequences in Asia==<br/>+The crisis had significant macro-level effects, including sharp reductions in values of currencies, stock markets, and other asset prices of several Asian countries. Many businesses collapsed, and as a consequence, millions of people fell below the poverty line in 1997-1998. Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand were the countries most affected by the crisis. <br/>+<br/>+The economic crisis also led to political upheaval, most notably culminating in the resignations of [[Suharto]] in Indonesia and Chavalit Yongchaiyudh in Thailand.  There was a general rise in anti-Western sentiment, with [[George Soros]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]] in particular singled out as targets of criticisms.  Heavy US investment in Thailand ended...replaced by mostly European investment, though Japanese investment continued.  <br/>+<br/>+More long-term consequences include reversal of the relative gains made in the boom years just preceding the crisis. For example, the [[CIA World Factbook]] reports that the per capita income (measured by [[purchasing power parity]]) in Thailand declined from $8,800 to $8,300 between 1997 and [[2005]]; in Indonesia it declined from $4,600 to $3,700; in Malaysia it declined from $11,100 to $10,400. Over the same period, world per capita income rose from $6,500 to $9,300 [http://www.umsl.edu/services/govdocs/wofact98/4.htm],[https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/]. Indeed, the CIA's analysis suggests the [[economy of Indonesia]] was still smaller in 2005 than it had been in 1997 despite a population increase of 30 million, suggesting an impact on that country similar to the [[Great Depression]]. <br/>+<br/>+In Thailand, GDP numbers could not explain the plight of ordinary people, as many thousands of office workers and other middle class were suddenly without plunged into poverty.  Drug abuse and prostitution increased, people started moonlighting as taxi drivers and street vendors en masse to make ends meet, and tourists were targeted in violent and desperate scams, thousands abandoned their automobiles, auto production became a third of pre-crisis levels but eventually recovered after many years.<br/>+<br/>+Within East Asia, the bulk of investment and a significant amount of economic weight shifted from [[Japan]] and [[ASEAN]] to [[China]].<br/>+<br/>+The crisis has been intensively analyzed by economists for its breadth, speed, and dynamism; it affected dozens of countries, had a direct impact on the livelihood of millions, happened within the course of a mere few months, and at each stage of the crisis leading economists, in particular the international institutions, seemed a step behind. Perhaps more interesting to economists is the speed with which it ended, leaving most of the developed economies unharmed. These curiosities have prompted an explosion of literature about [[financial economics]] and a litany of explanations why the crisis occurred. A number of critiques have been leveled against the conduct of the [[International Monetary Fund]] in the crisis, including one by former [[World Bank]] economist [[Joseph Stiglitz]].<br/>+<br/>+==Consequences elsewhere==<br/>+<br/>+After the Asian crisis, international investors were reluctant to lend to developing countries, leading to economic slowdowns in developing countries in many parts of the world. The powerful negative shock also sharply reduced the price of oil, which reached a low of $8/barrel towards the end of 1998, causing a financial pinch in [[OPEC]] nations and other oil exporters. <br/>+<br/>+Such sharply reduced oil revenue in turn contributed to the [[Russian financial crisis]] in 1998. Which in turn caused [[Long-Term Capital Management]] in the United States to collapse, after losing $4.6 billion in 4 months. A wider collapse in the financial markets was avoided when [[Alan Greenspan]] and the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]] organized a $3.625 bn bail-out.<br/>+<br/>+Major emerging economies Brazil and [[Argentina]] also fell into crisis in the late 1990s (see [[Argentine economic crisis|Argentine debt crisis]]). <br/>+<br/>+The crisis in general was part of a global backlash against the [[Washington Consensus]] and institutions such as the [[IMF]] and [[World Bank]], which simultaneously became unpopular in developed countries following the rise of the [[anti-globalization movement]] in [[1999]]. Four major rounds of world trade talks since the crisis, in [[Seattle]], [[Doha]], [[Cancun]], and [[Hong Kong]], have failed to produce a significant agreement as developing countries have become more assertive, and nations are increasingly turning toward regional or bilateral [[FTA]]s (Free Trade Agreement) as an alternative to global institutions.<br/>+<br/>+Many nations learned from this, and quickly built up foreign exchange reserves as a hedge against attacks, including Japan, China, South Korea.  Pan Asian currency swaps were introduced in the event of another crisis.<br/>+However, interestingly enough, such nations as Brazil, Russia, and India as well as most of East Asia began copying the Japanese model of weaking their currencies, restructuring their economies so as to create a [[current account]] surplus to build large [[foreign currency reserves]].<br/>+<br/>+==See also== <br/>+*[[Economics]]<br/>+*[[Economy of the People's Republic of China]]<br/>+*[[Economy of Hong Kong]]<br/>+*[[Economy of Indonesia]]<br/>+*[[Economy of Malaysia]]<br/>+*[[Economy of the Philippines]]<br/>+*[[Economy of South Korea]]<br/>+*[[Economy of Singapore]]<br/>+*[[Economy of Thailand]]<br/>+*[[Economy of Taiwan|Economy of the Republic of China (Taiwan)]]<br/>+*[[List of finance topics]]<br/> <br/> ==References==<br/>-*http://www.mormoni.pl/dl/zelwagi_2004_en.pdf, page 2, retrieved [[August 14]], [[2005]]<br/>-*http://www.ldsmissions.net/pwm/pages/history.htm, retrieved [[August 14]], [[2005]]<br/>-*http://www.kirche-jesu-christi.org/newsroom/deutschlandinfo/entwicklung/, retrieved [[August 14]], [[2005]]<br/>+*[[Michael Pettis]], ''The Volatility Machine: Emerging Economies and the Threat of Financial Collapse'' [[Oxford University Press]] [[2001]] ISBN 0195143302 <br/>+*[[Paul Blustein]], ''The Chastening: Inside the Crisis that Rocked the Global Financial System and Humbled the IMF'' PublicAffairs [[2001]] ISBN 1891620819<br/>+*[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/crash/ Frontline: The Crash], from the PBS series Frontline, unfortunately only the transcript is available and not the episode itself.<br/>+*[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/hi/index.html WGBH's Commanding Heights], additional information in Episode 3 Chapters 11-14.<br/>+*[http://www.attacberlin.de/fileadmin/Sommerakademie/Gowan_DollarWallstreetRegime.pdf Peter Gowan: The Globalization Gamble]<br/>+*Ngian Kee Jin, ''Coping with the Asian Financial Crisis: The Singapore Experience''. http://www.iseas.edu.sg/vr82000.pdf Extracted December 13, 2005.<br/>+* Tiwari, Rajnish (2003): ''Post-crisis Exchange Rate Regimes in Southeast Asia'', Seminar Paper, University of Hamburg.

After its most commercially successful point in 1997, amid creative struggles between guitarist Nick McCabe and vocalist Richard Ashcroft, the band quit in 1999.<br/> <br/>-I'd like to get some feedback from the other editors on an issue that has come up.  [[User:Carlossuarez46|Carlossuarez46]] has twice deleted the category of Baptist from this entry.  The second time the following exchange occurred:<br/>+==History==<br/>+===(1989&ndash;1992) Formation and ''Verve EP'' ===<br/>+The Verve (originally called Verve) were formed in the town of [[Wigan]] in [[Greater Manchester]] in 1989. Led by singer [[Richard Ashcroft]], the band caused a buzz in early 1991 for their ability to captivate audiences with their musical textures and sonic aptitude. As bandmembers sharing a collective liking for [[the Beatles]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Funkadelic]], and [[Krautrock]] — and a legendary appetite for psychedelics — they were signed to [[Hut Records]] and their debut studio release, ''[[Verve EP]]'' became a critical hit, making an impression with ethereal guitar work by Nick McCabe and psychedelic [[space rock]]. The album, featuring the artwork of designer Brian Cannon, came out in December 1992 and produced the singles "All in the Mind", "She's a Superstar" and "Gravity Grave", as well as spawning a few tours including the [[Gravity Grave Tour]].<br/> <br/>-from [[User:Carlossuarez46|Carlossuarez46]] talk page:<br/>-I see that you have removed "Baptists" from Clay Aiken's entry again, again saying there is no evidence.  In his memoirs Aiken states that he grew up in the Baptist church, attended the Moravian church for a time as a teen, and then returned to the Baptist church (pp. 212-213). On page 213 he states, "Today I am a proud Southern Baptist."  In addition to that evidence, here's a link from the Raleigh Leesville Baptist Church's website: [http://www.leesvillebaptist.com/clayton.htm]. -[[User:Jmh123|Jmh123]] 00:35, 8 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+===(1993&ndash;1994) First album ===<br/>+1993's ''[[A Storm in Heaven]]'', the band's full-length [[debut]], produced by Britpop [[producer]] [[John Leckie]] (both in the [[UK]] and the [[US]]), was a critical smash, but critical acclamation failed to translate into commercial success.<br/>+ <br/>+[[Image:Verve_earlyyears.jpg|right|thumb|150px|The early years from left: Nick McCabe, Richard Ashcroft, Peter Salisbury, Simon Jones]]<br/>+The second single, "[[Slide Away (Verve song)|Slide Away]]", topped the [[indie (music)|indie]] rock charts. The band played at the alternative rock festival, [[Lollapalooza]], in 1994. The tour was disastrous for the group as Ashcroft was hospitalised for [[dehydration]] caused by  overdosing with [[Ecstasy (drug)|Ecstasy]], and Salisbury was arrested for destroying a hotel room in [[Kansas]]. After the tour, the Jazz label Verve sued the band for copyright infringements and forced the group to officially change their name to The Verve.<br/> <br/>-Simply put the cite in the article. [[User:Carlossuarez46|Carlossuarez46]] 20:13, 8 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+===(1995&ndash;1996) Turbulent recordings and a breakup ===<br/>+The turmoil continued well into the recording sessions of the follow-up album, 1995's ''[[A Northern Soul]]''. The sessions started off well; McCabe even called the first three weeks of recording the happiest in his life (due to the massive intake of Ecstasy). However the rampant drug abuse and the strained relationship between Ashcroft and McCabe during the sessions took its toll on the band. Richard Ashcroft later described the recording experience as "Four intense, mad months. Really insane. In great ways and terrible ways. In ways that only good music and bad drugs and mixed emotions can make".<br/> <br/>-:I think some of the more general argument is that if it his being a Baptist is so insignificant that it is not mentioned in the article, then classifying him as such in a category would be unhelpful.  On the other hand, if his being a Baptist is significant then it should be put in the article.  --[[User:Hamiltonian|Hamiltonian]] 00:49, 11 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+The band departed from the neo-psychedelic sounds of ''A Storm in Heaven'' and focused more on conventional alternative rock. The singles "This Is Music", "On Your Own", and "History" all reached the UK Top 40. The latter two singles were particularly new for the Verve as they dabbled with soulful ballads.<br/> <br/>-::While his being a Christian is a significant part of his identity, being a Baptist is not especially so, in my opinion.  Anyone have a different view?  -[[User:Jmh123|Jmh123]] 04:41, 11 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+Around this period, [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] guitarist and friend of Ashcroft, [[Noel Gallagher]], wrote the classic "Cast No Shadow" for the troubled front-man. The song can be found on the album ''[[(What's the Story) Morning Glory?]]''. Ashcroft returned the gesture by writing the title song "Northern Soul" for Noel Gallagher.<br/> <br/>-A committed Baptist singer is apt to gain an immediate, strong following from that community. Often times, Baptists do indeed look favorably on each other, even on that basis alone. If it's true, this ought to be included. [[User:Merecat|Merecat]] 07:52, 13 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>+Album sales were once again disappointing and Richard Ashcroft broke up the band 3 months after its release in July.<br/> <br/>-:I swore I wasn't going to get into this, so someone else, please write about this.  Aiken grew up a Southern Baptist, but he has had his issues with them.  He talks in his book about leaving that church for a time and attending a Moravian church <s>in Raleigh</s>, before deciding that he felt comfortable distancing himself from the beliefs of the Southern Baptists while still worshipping with the church community he grew up in.  He probably sang a lot in that church growing up, but I haven't seen anything written about this.  Anyone?  In the book he also talks about strong disagreement with an relative (an aunt?)'s stance towards homosexuality. Given the assumptions some have made about his fans' and Aiken's own attitudes towards religion, moral conservativism, homosexuality and so forth, it would be interesting to add a well-written section on some of these matters, in Wikipedia style--no original research, no speculation, NPOV, reliable and verifiable sources, and keeping to the tone and style of what has already been written. And given this lot, be prepared to argue. :) -[[User:Jmh123|Jmh123]] 02:51, 9 April 2006 (UTC)<br/>+===(1997&ndash;1999) The height of fame and final break-up ===<br/>+Ashcroft reunited the group just a few weeks after the breakup, but McCabe refused to rejoin the line-up. As a replacement, the band chose old Wigan schoolmate [[Simon Tong]] to fill in the lead guitar duties for the remainder of the tour.<br/> <br/>-::The Moravian church wasn't in Raleigh.  Give me a few days to do some research and I'll do an outline.  - [[User:Maria202|Maria202]] 03:02, 9 April 2006 (UTC)<br/>+Ashcroft, Jones, Salisbury, and Tong went ahead and started writing songs for the upcoming album, with most of 1996 passed through recording sessions. In 1997, Nick McCabe returned to the fold alongside Tong - a crucial moment for the band. With the lineup back together, the group went through a "spiritual" (i.e. full of drug intake) recording process to finish the epic Alternative Rock classic, ''[[Urban Hymns]]''. For the first time in their careers, the Verve experienced commercial success. Not only was the album a hit in the UK, but the band also "broke" into the US and much of the rest of the world. The first single from ''[[Urban Hymns]]'', "[[Bitter Sweet Symphony]]", entered the UK charts at #2. The single reached #12 on the US charts, their highest position ever in the Billboards. The song borrows a reversed looped sample of a symphonic recording of the [[Rolling Stones]]' "The Last Time".<br/> <br/>-::: I'm glad you're interested, and look forward to reading what you come up with.  -[[User:Jmh123|Jmh123]] 03:50, 9 April 2006 (UTC)<br/>+ABKCO Music, which runs the Rolling Stones' back catalogue, and which had warned The Verve against using the Rolling Stones sample in "Bitter Sweet Symphony," successfully sued the Verve for 100% of the royalties for "Bitter Sweet Symphony"; further, as a result of the lawsuit, [[Keith Richards]] and [[Mick Jagger]] were given songwriting credits and full publishing rights to the song, which later appeared in a [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] commercial against The Verve's will. Also the song was used  in the movie [[Cruel Intentions]], there after the Verve filed a morality suit to make sure the song was not distributed anymore. Then, as the band was on a tour to promote the album, bassist Simon Jones collapsed on stage.

Cole]] replacing McCabe but the spark of their return seemed to be deserting them. After two headline performances at the V98 festivals and one at [[Slane Castle]] outside [[Dublin]], everything went quiet. Rumours began circulating that the band had called it quits for good. Finally, in April 1999 it was announced that The Verve had split up.<br/> <br/>-* OK, have at it.  I put a draft on '''[[User:Maria202/DraftOfClayAiken#Philosophy]]''' complete with references.  <br/>+===(2000&ndash;present) Post-breakup activities and Ashcroft solo career ===<br/>+After the band's final collapse, Simon Jones and Simon Tong formed a new group called [[The Shining (band)|The Shining]] as well as working with former [[The Stone Roses|Stone Roses]]-guitarist [[John Squire]] on a group that never properly formed. Tong has also appeared as a live replacement for ex-guitarist [[Graham Coxon]] in [[Blur]] and the additional guitarist for [[Gorillaz]]. [[Nick McCabe]] has mostly remained quiet after the breakup, although he has recently worked with a few artists, notably [[John Martyn]] and Leeds based band, [[The Music]]. Besides working with Ashcroft, Salisbury also filled in as the drummer for a UK tour in 2004 for [[Black Rebel Motorcycle Club]], when their original drummer briefly left due to alcohol and drug abuse. Salisbury also owns a drum shop in [[Stockport]], [[England]].<br/> <br/>-Philosophy<br/>+By the time the band finally split, Richard Ashcroft, who had quit taking drugs by the early 2000s, had already been working on solo material accompanied by, among others, the band's ex-drummer [[Peter Salisbury]] and B.J. Cole. In April 2000, his first solo single, "A Song For The Lovers", was released and hit Number 3. He debuted with ''[[Alone With Everybody]]'' (June 2000) and followed it by ''[[Human Conditions]]'' (October 2002). Recently, backed up by [[Coldplay]], Ashcroft performed "[[Bitter Sweet Symphony]]" at the [[Live 8]] concerts on [[2 July]], [[2005]] at [[Hyde Park, London]]. Many felt this would help to revive his solo career and, though receiving mixed reviews, his third solo ablum, ''[[Keys to the World]]'' (January 2006), peaked at #2 in the UK charts (being kept off the top spot only by [[Arctic Monkeys]]' record breaking debut) with the first single, "[[Break the Night with Colour]]" reaching #3.<br/> <br/>-"Adults have a responsibility to children-all children, not just their own."<ref>Learning to Sing - Clay Aiken, pg. 228</ref>  Describing himself as a proud Southern Baptist, <ref>Learning to Sing - Clay Aiken, pg. 226</ref> coupled with his refusal to sing lyrics he considers unacceptable for children to hear<ref>[http://www.pluggedinonline.com/music/music/a0001564.cfm plugged''n'' online website]</ref> resulted in the magazine [[EMF_Broadcasting|Christian Music Planet]] listing him as an American Idol Christian in addition to having him on the cover with a featured article of their January/February 2005<br/>-issue.<ref>[http://www.christianmusicplanet.com/magazine/viewarticle.asp?id=356 "American Idol Christians" -''Christian Music Planet'', 2004 in Review]</ref> <ref>[http://www.christianmusicplanet.com/magazine/?id=18 "Clay Aiken's Balancing Act" - ''Christian Music Planet'', by Andy Argyakis, January/February 2005]</ref> Aiken will not hesitate to share his beliefs if asked in an interview.

Normally we start new topics at the bottom of the "talk" age, but I'll leave it here so you can find my response.  This story has not been told, and would require [[Wiki:original research|original research]] to verify it.  <s>Yes, I know it is stated elsewhere on Wikipedia, but we have higher standards here, or we try, anyway.</s>  All that is known is that Kelly signed with Clay's management of the time, The Firm.  We don't know that Kelly broke her contract.  We don't know for sure that Clay did either, though there were many rumors that he did.  Rumor is that Clay was able to break his because AI had violated some terms, possibly by turning down some big endorsement deals without consulting him, but we prefer not to publish unsubstantiated rumors in this article.  Now if reporters ever got back to reporting, and someone investigated and published on this topic in a reputable publication with multiple, verifiable sources, then we could include it in the article.  He is the "savvy, tough businessman" you describe, so maybe we can think of another way to convey that.  Thanks for the suggestion! (ETA: struck this statement since I can no longer find such a reference in Wikipedia.)  -[[User:Jmh123|Jmh123]] 23:11, 30 March 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-:According to Kelly's fan boards Kelly's brother found that the materials she paid for to promote her cd were not being sent to the stores and that's how she got out of her contract.  There was a lot of speculation that Clay had something to do with Kelly joining The Firm, the management company he was with at the time.  As Jmh123 said, there are no verifiable sources for this information.  - [[User:Maria202|Maria202]] 00:37, 31 March 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-::An added thought.

The Enquirer doesn't say JP lied about his original story--I doubt they'd say that even if they suspect it--but they do portray him as having lied about his interactions with them. He told a different story to the press about those interactions, along with his recent "apology", just as he has told different stories all along the way.  I suggested removing the piped link only, because we are still awaiting the possibility of a response during album promo--in-depth magazine or TV interview, etc.  As for a rewrite on Paulus--adding the latest, sure.  -[[User:Jmh123|Jmh123]] 23:08, 26 July 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-:I read the article.  Until the allegations are more comprehensively disposed of (or proven correct), I think the link through ''tabloid stories'' is correct.  However, these new developments should be placed on the John Paulus page.  <br/>-:I half wonder if the actual correct solution is to NOT have a John Paulus article (because he personally isn't notable outside the controversy, upon further consideration), and to replace it by separate article, [[Clay Aiken allegations]] or [[Clay Aiken controversy]], perhaps, where both sides of the allegations are presented.  The allegations are the only reason we have a JP article, the rest of it is non-notable, so maybe only the allegations should remain?  Just a thought. -- [[User:ArglebargleIV|ArglebargleIV]] 04:27, 27 July 2006 (UTC)<br/>-::With no comment from Clay Aiken there is no controversy nor are there two sides, only an allegation made by JP. I do agree with you that this is all that makes him notable.  [[User:Maria202|Maria202]] 18:06, 27 July 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-The single NE editor's quote in the article does not rebut the content of Paulus original allegation, and only offers a statement on how it came about. The overwhelming amount of coverage that the original allegations, the subsequent webcam pictures, and continued reporting on other details (the JP blog apology for hurting Clay and his fans by the revelation) have received weighed against the single NE editor's quote and controversy over how the story came about does not quantify removal, simply because fan editors wish to disassociate Aiken with the allegations. I note that the amount of press coverage, before his now PEOPLE cover story announcement, dedicated to Lance Bass's sexuality paled in comparison to the overwhelming amount of press attention that Aiken has received on this issue. John Paulus has still, to-date, not retracted his story and continues to publicly stand by his public addmission that a sexual encounter occured between the two. If any rewritten is to be done, to include a more fuller picture, it should include reference to the webcam pictures, The FTC Complaint filed by the disgrunteled fans, as well as the cancellation of the performance at the Christian fashion show because of the scandal. --[[User:Rabinid|Rabinid]] 23:25, 26 July 2006 (UTC)<br/>-:Just a small note -- Lance Bass has had less press attention on the gay issue then Clay Aiken has had because, recently, Lance Bass has less attention on any issue compared to Aiken.  Timing is everything. -- [[User:ArglebargleIV|ArglebargleIV]] 04:27, 27 July 2006 (UTC)<br/>-::Rabinid's assessment is exaggerated in every way.  It's pointless to argue, and it's all been argued before.  Arglebargle, we can't remove the Paulus entry--we tried that--but I do agree on his lack of notability.  I don't think his allegations warrant their own entry; after the tabloid media lost interest in him, Paulus publicized his story endlessly in a series of blogs, and received no further attention for it from the media other than for his "apology".  There is no other side to present, as Aiken has had the good sense to ignore this whole thing, and blog battles between fans and haterz are not a reliable source for Wikipedia.  -[[User:Jmh123|Jmh123]] 16:21, 29 July 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-* Forgive me for being late to the discussion, but the agreement that all of us subscribed to was that the paragraph wouldn't be touched until Clay Aiken's cd comes out, and even then we would only discuss the possibility of changing it.

It wasn't an X number of months, because if I recall this discussion was going on in April and it's certainly not been six months from April, right?

Does one individual have the right to determine how this article should be written?  Is the individual who has made these pronouncements in a rather ostentatious way (box at the top of the page) familiar with the complexity of previous discussions on some of these issues?  Do the rest of us have the right to disagree with these pronouncements, and what is the procedure for discussion/modification/deletion of the list?  For example, Maria has already made some changes in response; can she delete portions of the list accordingly?  The peer review is one sentence--not particularly helpful in this instance.  At any rate, while I have no objections to including a balanced mention of the lawsuit, it isn't clear to me how we can "verify...rumors about his sexuality" beyond what has already been stated in the article. It isn't up to Wikipedia to pronounce Aiken gay or not gay, and the article has already addressed the rumors in some detail, including Aiken's own statements on the matter. We have agreed to postpone further edits on this matter until album promo, at which time there may or may not be more said. Aiken's response to the lawsuit, including the statement: "As a so-called 'celebrity' I have become used to scurrilous allegations and untruths being made about me and my work. I have always taken the path of not reacting to these matters and have accepted them as, somehow, coming with the 'job.' However, I cannot, and will not, stand by when these attacks are made on my family."

The Good Article review (which somebody requested) was apparently performed by [[User:Davodd|Davodd]].  He's saying that, in his (solicited) opinion, that the article is close, but to be listed as a [[WP:GA|Good Article]] there is a to-do list that would have to be satisfied, or it's not going to be approved.  Good Article is a step toward [[WP:FA|Featured Article]] status, reserved for the best of the best, and which can appear on the front page as the article of the day. Now, about whether the to-do list should be done or not....uh, will discuss later, I have go get dinner. :-) However, possibly mentioning the lawsuit that Jeannie Holleman filed, a news story or two, and Clay's reaction, might be a good idea, even though I personally think the suit is a pile of steaming doodoo. -- [[User:ArglebargleIV|ArglebargleIV]] 21:18, 24 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-::BTW, Maria, nice work on the corrections! -- [[User:ArglebargleIV|ArglebargleIV]] 21:18, 24 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-::: You know, if Wikipedia has a goal of mentioning every frivolous lawsuit that is created against every celebrity - which I doubt, then they will be considerably contributing to the intent behind a good portion of those lawsuits, which is to get attention for some person or cause, however I could see mentioning the book lawsuit if it does not get thrown out of court.  <br/>-:::However, when did it become Wikipedia's goal to be the source for current news and gossip/rumor?  I do not think that it is.  As a matter of fact there is considerable arguement - which we have been through in detail (see archives and arbitration) that suggest that this should NOT happen. Wikipedia is an encyclopedic reference, not a gossip column. If folks are coming to Wikepedia for current gossip and rumor, then that says that portions of Wikipedia need to be cleaned up to get rid of the trash, and get back to being an encyclopedia.  [[User:Michigan user|Michigan user]] 11:36, 25 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-::::By omitting real and notable controversies, you give an incomplete picture of the life of this celebrity. As the article reads now, the pain of fame endured by Mr. Aiken is not adequately documented. The ways people have taken (or tried to take) advantage of him are not documented well - or at all, despite abundant sources. This article is incomplete in that it does not address fully and place into context the downside of fame for this celebrity. Please note examples in the following artists with controversy sections: [[Madonna_%28entertainer%29#1992.E2.80.931997:_Sex_controversy_and_Evita|Madonna]], [[Beatles#Backlash_and_controversy|Beatles]]. The fact is that this article was listed as a [[WP:GA]] candidate, which means it needs to be better than average. Until it transcends its current fan-oriented status it will not advance beyond being a well-written, PR-friendly (fan biased) profile.

It is not our job to be sensationalist, or be the primary vehicle for the spread of titillating claims about people's lives.<b><br/>-<br/>-:::::::Frankly this was discussed in detail.  Pages and pages of detail. And the consensus was reached for the article to be stated the way that it is.  It so happened that you were not involved at the time that the discussion was held, however you really need to re-read those many pages, and visit the arbitration relating to this.  I see no reason to resurrect an issue that was already discussed to death.  [[User:66.82.9.82|66.82.9.82]] 21:51, 25 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-:Many articles have a "To-do" list.

The general issue of rumors is addressed, and there is a link to Paulus' story.  I do not want to rehash heated discussions we've had here before on multiple occasions.  I have neither the time not the heart for it.  The regular editors here of various POVs have an agreement not to address these issues further for the time being.

Three possible derivations are:<br/>+*[[O'odham language|O'odham]] words "alĭ ṣon" ("small spring"), actually the name of a town which is called "Arizonac" in English. Arizonac is a small town about eight miles (12 km) south of the [[U.S.-Mexico border|United States–Mexican border]]. Historically, it may have been "alĭ son" or even "alĭ sona". The O'odham "l" is a [[voiced alveolar lateral fricative]], which might sound to a Spanish or English speaker like an "r" sound. Later in the mid [[18th century]] Spanish missionaries changed Father [[Eusebio Francisco Kino]]'s maps of the area; they renamed the town Arizonac as Arizona. As the maps were republished and circulated in [[Europe]], the name Arizona became attached to the whole northern part of [[New Spain]].<br/>+*[[Spanish language|Spanish]] words "árida zona" ("arid zone").<br/>+*A [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] or Aztec word "arizuma" meaning "silver-bearing".<br/>+<br/>+Meeting its original [[Native Americans in the United States|native]] inhabitants, [[Marcos de Niza]], a [[Franciscan]], explored the area in [[1539]]. [[Francisco Vásquez de Coronado|Coronado's]] expedition entered the area in [[1540]]&ndash;[[1542|42]] during its search for [[Quivira and Cíbola|Cíbola]]. [[Eusebio Kino|Father Kino]] developed a chain of missions and taught the Indians [[Christianity]] in [[Pimería Alta]] (now southern Arizona and northern [[Sonora]]) in the [[1690s]] and early [[1700s]]. [[Spain]] founded fortified towns (presidios) at Tubac in [[1752]] and Tucson in [[1775]]. All of what is now Arizona became part of Mexico's northwest frontier upon the Mexican assertion of independence from Spain in [[1810]]. The United States took possession of most of Arizona at the end of the [[Mexican War]] in [[1848]], after paying the Mexican government. In [[1853]] the land below the [[Gila River]] was acquired from Mexico in the [[Gadsden Purchase]]. Arizona was administered as part of the [[Territory of New Mexico]] until it was organized into a [[Arizona Territory|separate territory]] on [[February 24]], [[1863]].<br/>+<br/>+Other names including "Gadsonia", "Pimeria", "Montezuma", "Arizuma", and "Arizonia" had been considered for the territory [http://www.pima.gov/cmo/sdcp/Archives/reports/Cult.html], however when [[Abraham Lincoln|President Lincoln]] signed the final bill, it read "Arizona", and the name became permanent. [[Montezuma (mythology)|Montezuma]] was not the Mexican Emperor, but the sacred name of a divine hero to the [[Pueblo people]] of the Gila valley, and was probably considered &mdash; and rejected &mdash; for its sentimental value, before the name "Arizona" was settled upon.<br/>+<br/>+[[Brigham Young]] sent [[Mormon]]s to Arizona in the mid-to-late [[19th century]]. They founded [[Mesa, Arizona|Mesa]], [[Snowflake, Arizona|Snowflake]], [[Heber-Overgaard, Arizona|Heber]], [[Safford, Arizona|Safford]] and other towns. They also settled in the [[Phoenix Valley]] (or "Valley of the Sun"), [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]], [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott]], among other areas.  The Mormons settled what became known as [[Northern Arizona]] and northern New Mexico, but this areas was in fact part of old [[New Mexico Territory]].  The largest ancestry of these settlers is [[German American]].<br/>+<br/>+Arizona became a U.S. state on [[February 14]], [[1912]]. Arizona was the 48th state admitted into the U.S. and the last of the [[Continental United States|contiguous states]] admitted.<br/>+<br/>+Cotton farming and copper mining, two of Arizona's most important statewide industries, suffered heavily during the [[Great Depression]], but it was during the [[1920s]] and [[1930s]] that [[tourism]] began to be the important Arizona industry it is today. Dude ranches such as the K L Bar and Remuda in Wickenburg, along with the Flying V and Tanque Verde in Tucson, gave tourists the chance to experience the flavor and life of the "old West." Several upscale hotels and resorts opened during this period, some of which are still top tourist draws to this day; they include the [[Arizona Biltmore]] in central Phoenix (opened 1929) and the [[Wigwam Resort]] on the west side of the Phoenix area (opened 1936).<br/>+<br/>+Arizona was the site of [[Germany|German]] and [[Italy|Italian]] prisoner of war camps during [[World War II|WWII]]. The Phoenix area site was purchased after the war by the [[Maytag]] family (of major home [[appliance]] fame), and is currently utilized as the [[Phoenix Zoo]]. A [[Japanese American internment]] camp was located on [[Mount Lemmon]], just outside of the state's southeastern city of Tucson.  Another POW camp was located near the Gila River in eastern Yuma County.<br/>+<br/>+Arizona's population grew tremendously after World War II, in part because of the development of [[air conditioning]], which made the intense summers more comfortable. According to the Arizona Blue Book (published by the Secretary of State's office each year), the state population in 1910 was 294,353. By 1970 it was 1,752,122. The percentage growth each decade averaged about 20% in the earlier decades and about 60% each decade thereafter.<br/>+<br/>+The 1960's saw the establishment of [[retirement communities]], special age-restricted subdivisions catering exclusively to the needs of senior citizens who wanted to escape the harsh winters of the Midwest and the Northeast. [[Sun City]], established by developer [[Del Webb]] and opened in 1960 was one of the first such communities. [[Green Valley, Arizona|Green Valley]], south of Tucson, was another such community designed to be a retirement subdivision for Arizona's teachers. (Many of these senior citizens arrive in Arizona each winter and stay only during the winter months; they are referred to as [[snowbirds]].)<br/>+<br/>+Three ships named [[USS Arizona|USS ''Arizona'']] have been named in honor of the state, although only [[USS Arizona (BB-39)|USS ''Arizona'' (BB-39)]] was so named after statehood was achieved.<br/>+<br/>+==Demographics==<br/>+{| class="infobox"<br/>+|-<br/>+! colspan="4" bgcolor="#ccccff" | Historical populations<br/>+|-<br/>+!

The original Capitol building, with its distinctive copper dome, was dedicated in 1901 (construction was completed for $136,000 in 1900), when the area was still a territory. Phoenix became the official state capital with Arizona's admission to the union in 1912.<br/>+<br/>+Separate legislative buildings for the [[Arizona House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and [[Arizona Senate|Senate]] were dedicated in 1960, and an Executive Office Building was dedicated in 1974 (the ninth floor of this building is where the Office of the Governor is located). The original Capitol building was converted into a museum.<br/>+<br/>+The Capitol complex is fronted and highlighted by the richly landscaped [[Wesley Bolin Memorial Park]], named after [[Wesley Bolin]], a governor who died in office in the 1970's. Numerous monuments and memorials are on the site, including the anchor and signal mast from the [[USS Arizona]] (one of the U.S. Navy ships sunk in Pearl Harbor); a granite version of the [[Ten Commandments]]; and the [[Arizona Vietnam Veterans' Memorial]].<br/>+<br/>+Arizona's legislature is [[bicameral]] (like the legislature of every other state except [[Nebraska]]) and consists of a thirty-member [[Arizona Senate|Senate]] and a 60-member [[Arizona House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. Legislators are elected for two-year terms.<br/>+<br/>+Each Legislature covers a two-year period. The first session following the general election is known as the first regular session, and the session convening in the second year is known as the second regular session. Each regular session begins on the second Monday in January and adjourns ''sine die'' (terminates for the year) no later than Saturday of the week in which the 100th day from the beginning of the regular session falls. The President of the Senate and Speaker of the House, by rule, may extend the session up to seven additional days. Thereafter, the session can only be extended by a majority vote of members present of each house.<br/>+<br/>+The current majority party is the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], which has held power since [[1950]].<br/>+<br/>+The fiscal year 2006-07 general fund budget, approved by the Arizona Legislature in June 2006, is slightly less than $10 billion. Besides the money spent on state agencies, it also includes more than $500 million in income- and property tax cuts, pay raises for government employees, and additional funding for the K-12 education system. <br/>+<br/>+Arizona state senators and representatives are elected for two year terms and are limited to four consecutive terms in a chamber, though there is no limit on the total number of terms. When a lawmaker is term-limited from office, it is not uncommon for him or her to run for election in the other chamber.<br/>+<br/>+Arizona's [[executive branch]] is headed by a governor elected for a four-year term. The governor may serve any number of terms, though no more than two in a row. The current governor of Arizona is [[Janet Napolitano]], a [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]]. She has been governor since [[2003]].<br/>+<br/>+The two U.S. Senators from Arizona are Senator [[John McCain]] (Republican) and Senator [[Jon Kyl]] (Republican).<br/>+<br/>+Arizona's representatives in the United States House of Representatives are [[Rick Renzi]] (R-1), [[Trent Franks]] (R-2), [[John Shadegg]] (R-3), [[Ed Pastor]] (D-4), [[J.D. Hayworth]] (R-5), [[Jeff Flake]] (R-6), [[Raul Grijalva]] (D-7), and [[Jim Kolbe]] (R-8). Jim Kolbe announced his retirement from Congress in 2006, creating one of the few open seats in the nation in Arizona's Congressional District 8. Arizona gained two seats in the House of Representatives due to [[redistricting]] based on [[United States 2000 census|Census 2000]].<br/>+<br/>+While the Republican Party has traditionally dominated Arizona politics since the [[1950s]], the state's changing demographics reflect political changes. Arizona narrowly voted for [[Bill Clinton]] in [[1996]], the first Democrat to take the state in decades. In [[2004]], [[George W. Bush]] won the state's ten [[electoral vote]]s by a margin of 11 percentage points with 54.9 percent of the vote. The state's concentration of Democrats is strongest in the city of [[Tucson]] (excluding Tucson's historically Republican-dominated suburbs) and the counties of [[Santa Cruz County, Arizona|Santa Cruz]] and [[Apache County, Arizona|Apache]]. [[Maricopa County, Arizona|Maricopa County]], home of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and the fourth-most populous in the country, has voted Republican in every presidential election since at least 1952. On the other hand, the current mayor of Phoenix, [[Phil Gordon (politician)|Phil Gordon]], is a Democrat. The current state attorney general and governor are also both Democrats. Both Governor Napolitano and Attorney General [[Terry Goddard]] are widely expected to win their upcoming elections, though both face Republican challengers.<br/>+<br/>+''See also : [[United States presidential election, 2004, in Arizona]]<br/>+<br/>+==Important cities and towns==<br/>+{{ussm|arizona.png|az}}<br/>+[[Image:phoenix sykline.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Phoenix]]<br/>+[[Image:City Street of Tucson, AZ.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Tucson]]<br/>+See: [[List of cities in Arizona]], [[List of cities in Arizona (by population)]], [[List of Arizona counties]]<br/>+<br/>+[[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], the largest city in the state, is the capital.

The state is a recognized center of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] art, with a number of galleries such as the [[Heard Museum]] showcasing historical and contemporary works. [[Sedona]], [[Jerome]], and [[Tubac]] are known as budding artist colonies, and small arts scenes exist in the larger cities and near the state universities.<br/>+<br/>+Many tourist souvenirs produced in Arizona or by its residents display characteristic images, such as sunsets, coyotes, and desert plants. Several major Hollywood films, such as ''[[U-Turn]]'', ''[[Waiting to Exhale]]'', ''[[Just One of the Guys]]'', ''[[Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure]]'', ''[[Scorpion King]]'', ''[[The Banger Sisters]]'', ''[[Used Cars]]'', and ''[[Raising Arizona]]'' have been made there (as indeed have many [[Westerns]]).

This is due in large part to greater difficulty crossing the border around more populated areas such as [[El Paso, Texas]] imparted by policy changes in recent years.  Critics of such changes argue that the changes do not make a substantial difference in the number of people crossing the border into the United States illegally each year.  Critics of the policy also point to a growing [[humanitarian crisis]] in the American Southwest as hundreds or thousands of illegal immigrants die each year attempting to make the crossing in increasingly remote and inhospitable locations such as the [[Sonoran Desert]]. The use of professional smugglers to ferry people across the border illegally is also increasing, see: [[people smuggling]]. Such smuggling operations are known to also often be associated with the cross-border [[illicit drug trade]] and have caused a wave of crime in Southwestern states.  Proponents of the changes in policy argue that the new policy is successful in reducing the amount of illegal immigration into the United States.  Accurate numbers that can effectively support either side of the argument are rare due to the illegal nature of the activity.  In recent years, illegal immigration has become a major issue in both Southwestern politics and politics throughout the United States.<br/>+<br/>+===Notable people===<br/>+Famous Arizonans also include:<br/>+* [[Robert Haag]], lives in the [[Tucson, Arizona]] area, buys and sells [[meteorites]].

These are one of the most heavily witnessed UFO sightings ever. The sightings occurred on [[March 13]], [[1997]]. The five lights in a "V"-shape were first spotted in [[Henderson, Nevada]], and then moved to [[Paulden, Arizona|Paulden]], on to [[Prescott Valley, Arizona|Prescott Valley]], to [[Dewey, Arizona|Dewey]], and then finally to [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. After the lights left Phoenix, they moved toward [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]], following [[Interstate 10]] at a slow pace. UFO witnesses and investigators claim these lights have never been completely explained; at the time of the occurrence, the Arizona Air National Guard issued a public statement that the 'mysterious' lights were likely flares dropped by a Maryland Air National Guard training mission which was in the area and returning to Tucson at about the time the lights were reported.<br/>+<br/>+==See also==<br/>+* [[Scouting in Arizona]]<br/>+<br/>+==External links==<br/>+{{sisterlinks|Arizona}}<br/>+*[http://www.az.gov/webapp/portal/ Arizona @ Your Service]<br/>+*[http://www.bea.doc.gov/bea/regional/map/map.asp?po=AZ Arizona Regional Accounts Data]<br/>+*[http://www.fedstats.gov/qf/states/04000.html Arizona Demographic Data from FedStats]<br/>+*[http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/2001/tables/redist_az.html Census 2000 Data for Arizona]<br/>+*[http://www.ecanned.com/indsum/level1/AZ/index.html Arizona Employment Data]<br/>+*[http://www.arizonaguide.com/home.asp Official Arizona Office of Tourism]<br/>+*[http://www.pr.state.az.us/Parks/parksites.html Arizona State Parks]<br/>+*[http://www.lib.az.us/ Arizona State Library, Archives and Public Records]<br/>+*[http://www.usnewspapers.org/state/arizona Arizona Newspapers]<br/>+*[http://geology.com/state-map/arizona.shtml Arizona State Map Collection]<br/>+*[http://www.ers.usda.gov/statefacts/az.htm Arizona State Facts]<br/>+<br/>+==References==<br/>+*David M.

Your latest edit (17:00 UTC) to {{[[Template:Infobox Single|Infobox Single]]}} broke all articles using {{[[Template:Extra chronology|Extra chronology]]}} again.

Remember me?  I'm the guy who posted the logos on all the NBA seasons pages, of which you told me was not allowed due to rules against images being used as decoration.  While I understand that policy and have complied to the best of my knowledge, I do have a new question about it.  Since the World Cup is going on now, I looked at some previous World Cup articles just for fun.  However, all those pages uses flag images in the same way I used the logos on the NBA articles.  Isn't that considered "decoration" as well?  It seems kinda silly to me that wikipedia has so many restrictions on fair use images where one can use a PD imsge liberaly.  If it's just a matter of PD vs. Fair Use, than I'm sorry to say that it seems to me that Wikipedia is being too conservative.  Here's my view.  If a flag is supposed to be a symbol of a country, than a sports logo is a symbol of a team or an organization.  Moreover, templates aside, the logo should be used to identify said team or organization outside of that team/organization's main article.  I mean, the flags on the different World Cup pages showcased not only the countries, but put the individual tournament in historical context, much like what I did with all the differing NBA logos through the different seasons, because how else is one to show the extent of the evolution of the NBA on Wikipedia?  Just because we err on the side of caution, doesn't mean that we should devalue creativity altogether.  But I guess that's just me.  What do you think?

As you well know, the existance of images on these pages (whether for the episodes in the list or the list itself) are in dispute and it would be good Wikiquette to hold off on removing anything you deem decorative until the matter is resolved. I can argue conversely and say if I hit "Random article" on the left and got that page and had never heard of the Simpsons, the article would be clearer if I saw an image of The Simpsons on the article page so I understand what kind of show it is. At the very least, you could have posted a notice on the talk page proposing a deletion on the grounds of decoration.

[[User:LtPowers|Powers]] 15:29, 4 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-::::::::But it seems to me that part of providing encyclopedic coverage of a league is to show the logos of member teams.

[[User:LtPowers|Powers]] 15:36, 4 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-:::::::::I'm not sure what kind of argument you're looking for.

Obviously, given current Wikipedia usage, it means "as little as possible without compromising the integrity of the encyclopedia", or something along those lines.  There must be some caveat on "minimized" or else we wouldn't have any fair use images at all.  The question is how far that caveat extends.  ''That's'' what we need to define, by consensus.

Contrary to what you may think about us sports editors, I'm 100% fully aware about what Wikipedia stands for and what the grand picture of this website is.  However, I also believe that we cannot rule this entire website on the basis of guidelines if there is a large amount of confusion on some of the policies, like fair use for example.  What may be black and white to you and a few others is not so to the rest of the editors here, and that is something that you should recognize.<br/>-Also, you must know that ALL of my edits on wikipedia was made to make wikipedia better as an encyclopedia, and not to make it look like ESPN or Sports Illustrated.  The inclusion of the NBA logos were an encyclopedic tool to be used to help track the course of a team through NBA History.  The current logos on the main NBA page were a tool to help visually identify a team, since there are no other alternatives to logos anyway.  This isn't "Man, Wikipedia looks boring.  Let's spruce things up a little!" as it seems like you are putting it.  To me, this whole issue ISN'T about logos.  I mean I would personally prefer them on, but that isn't the issue here.  This is about Wikipedia as a whole, and how not listning to new ideas simply because "It violates wiki-policy" will not only harm wikipedia's potential for growth, bit will deter new users and potential editors from participating on what is otherwise a fantastic project.  <br/>-Considering the fact that you are indeed an administrator, your actions and your (now apparant) biases concerning Wikipedia's editors, myself included, is sad indeed.  You make it sound like sports editors are out to ruin Wikipedia, when that isn't the case at all.  My intentions were to make Wikipedia the best web resource available and all of my edits were in accordance to my interpretation to Wikipedia's policy, always have been and always will be.  But if you think that I am too misguided to edit here, then maybe I shouldn't edit here at all.  But I believe in Wikipedia so much to let it end like this.

I was talking about the discusion to change the fair use policy, or any other policy issues for that matter, itself.  Moreover, we SHOULD care about how other editors feel, because those editors bring in new ideas and information that helps Wikipedia grow every day.  Not caring if individual editors leaving for one reason or another is not the right way to be an administrator.  I would try to work with every user if they had a problem, and be open to any possible ideas they have about Wikipedia's policy if they have issues.  You chose to stick to the policy, despite the fact that so many editors have an issue about Fair Use, not just logos, but the whole concept.  Wikipedia is more than a "free content" encyclopedia.  It is a community of editors who all have ideas on how to improve Wikipedia.  Those attempts do not deserve to be shot down and thrown out the wayside just because the policies are supposidly final.  You may say I'm in the wrong, but IMHO, you are in the wrong with the way you've chosen to approach this issue, I'm sorry to say.

Important movies from the classic era on which there is a substantial difference of opinion include ''Casablanca'' and the Alfred Hitchcock films ''Rebecca'', ''Suspicion'', and ''Spellbound''.

At the time Steiner believed that the introduction of chemical farming was a major problem. Steiner was convinced that the quality of food in his time was degrading, and he believed the source of the problem were artificial [[fertilizer]]s and [[pesticide]]s, however he did not believe this was because of [[chemistry|chemical]] or [[biology|biological]] properties relating to the substances involved, but for ''spiritual'' shortcomings in these substances. Steiner considered the world and everything living in it as primarily spiritual in nature, the physical and thus chemical or biological processes involved were secondary. He also believed that living matter was different from dead matter, a viewpoint commonly referred to as [[vitalism]].  <br/>+The term "biologically dynamic" or "biodynamic" was however not invented by Steiner, but by his adherents. Biodynamics includes many of the ideas of [[organic farming]] (but predates the term) but is also based on [[anthroposophy|anthroposophical]] ideas of the soil and the life on and in it as a living, sentient system.<br/> <br/>-== Formal ==<br/>-In more formal terms, in [[combinatorics]], a '''combination''' is a [[subset]]. In a [[set]], the order does not matter. These are represented usually with curly braces: {2, 4, 6}. With sets, since order does not matter, you are only interested in '''what''' is present, not in what order. Thus,<br/>-:{2, 4, 6} = {6, 4, 2}.<br/>-Also, {1, 1, 1} is the same as {1} because a ''set'' is defined by its elements; they don't usually appear more than once.<br/>+A central aspect of biodynamics is that the farm as a whole should be seen as an organism, and therefore should be closed self-nourishing system, which the preparations nourish. Disease of organisms is not to be tackled in isolation but is a symptom of problems in the whole organism.<br/> <br/>-===Permutation with repetition===<br/>-When order matters and an object can be chosen more than once then the number of permutations is<br/>-<math> n^r \,</math><br/>+==History==<br/>+Agricultural work arising out of the insights of Rudolf Steiner is headquartered at the [[Goetheanum]] in Dornach, Switzerland. <br/> <br/>-where ''n'' is the number of objects from which you can choose and ''r'' is the number to be chosen. <br/>+===Research History===<br/>+Not long after Steiner's lectures on agriculture in the 1920's a "Research Circle" to test and verify Steiner's and the insights of others into the nature of life and health of soil, plants and animals. Originally this research was under the direction of Drs. Ehrenfried Pfeiffer, Eugene Kolisko and Lilly Kolisko.<br/> <br/>-For example, if you have the letters A, B, C, and D and you wish to discover the number of ways to arrange them in three letter patterns ([[trigram]]s) you find that there are 4<sup>3</sup> or 64 ways. <br/>-This is because for the first slot you can choose any of the four values, for the second slot you can choose any of the four, and for the final slot you can choose any of the four letters.  Multiplying them together gives the total.<br/>+===Demeter History===<br/>+The [[Demeter International]] association for the certification of farms and processors was initiated in 1928.  <br/> <br/>-===Permutation without repetition===<br/>-When the order matters and each object can be chosen only once, then the number of permutations is<br/>-<math> \frac{n!}{(n-r)!} </math><br/>+The U.S. Demeter Association was formed in the 1980's and certified its first farm in 1982.<br/> <br/>-where ''n'' is the number of objects from which you can choose, ''r'' is the number to be chosen and '''!''' is the standard symbol meaning [[factorial]]. <br/>+===Biodynamics comes to the U.S.===<br/>+In the 1930's, Steiner sent Dr. Ehrenfried Pfeiffer (1899 - 1961) to the U.S. Shortly after his arrival, the [[Biodynamic Farming & Gardening Association, Inc.]] and the [[Pfeiffer Institute]] were formed. Pfeiffer supported the [[organic agriculture]] movement in the U.S.<br/> <br/>-For example, if the first, second, and third place winners in a dog show are to be selected from amongst 15 canine finalists, then this may occur in any of 15!/(15&nbsp;−&nbsp;3)! = 2730 possible ways.<br/>+===Biodynamics practiced worldwide===<br/>+Biodynamics today is now practiced in more than 50 countries worldwide. <br/> <br/>-Note that if ''r'' = ''n'' (meaning number of chosen elements is equal to number of elements to choose from) then the formula becomes<br/>-<math> \frac{n!}{(n-n)!} = \frac{n!}{0!} = n!</math> when 0! = 1! = 1<br/>+===Biodynamics And The Environmental Movement===<br/>+In 1956, the state of [[New York]], in an effort to stop a plague of [[fire ants]], conducted wide-spread and indiscriminate aerial spraying of [[DDT]] mixed with fuel oil (so that it would adhere better) on [[Long Island]], [[New York]]. [[Mary T. Richards]] and [[Marjorie Spock]] (sister of the noted Pediatrician, [[Benjamin Spock]]) whose garden on Long Island had been tended for many years using the non-chemical,  [[Biodynamic agriculture]] methods, sued the government to stop the spraying and for damages.<br/> <br/>-For example, if you have three people and you want to find out how many ways you may arrange them it would be 3! or 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ways. The reason for this is because you can choose from 3 for the initial slot, then you are left with only two to choose from for the second slot, and that leaves only one for the final slot.  Multiplying them together gives the total.<br/>+The case went to trial in Long Island, and Richards and Spock made sure that the shocking misuse of pesticides by the government filled the local newspapers. Richards and Spock brought together a wide-range of scientific experts in documenting the enormous damage that pesticides had done to fish, birds, wildlife, dairy cattle, gardens, livestock, and perhaps to children.<br/> <br/>-===Combination without repetition===<br/>+The enormous press coverage caught the attention of [[Rachael Carson]] who, at that time, was researching the affects of pesticides. Carson attended the trial and soon became friends with Richards and Spock who, when they found out about her scientific and literary background, provided Carson with transcripts and research data which they had assembled for the trial.<br/> <br/>-When the order does not matter, but each object can be chosen only once, the number of combinations is<br/>-<math>\frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!} = {n \choose r} = {n \choose {n-r}}</math><br/>-where ''n'' is the number of objects from which you can choose and ''r'' is the number to be chosen. <br/>+As [[University of Maryland]] historian [[Linda Lear]] put it: “It (the trial) provided Rachel Carson with ‘mountains of material,’ important collaborators such as Mary Richards and Marjorie Spock, and a wealth of expert contacts in medical and agricultural fields previously unknown to her.” [http://www.history.vt.edu/Barrow/Hist3706/readings/lear.html]<br/> <br/>-For example, if you have ten numbers and wish to choose 5 you would have 10!/5! (10 − 5)! = 252 ways to choose.<br/>+“[[Silent Spring]] indicted the chemical industry, the government, and agribusiness for indiscriminately using pesticides… There are very few books that can be said to have changed the course of history, but this was one of them. It polarized government, science, and industry, and made people stop in their tracks and see the world in a new way. With its publication, ‘ecology’ became part of everyday vocabulary.” [http://www.history.vt.edu/Barrow/Hist3706/readings/lear.html] It took the U.S. government until 1972 to ban the use of DDT in the United States.<br/> <br/>-The number of five-card poker hands possible from a standard fifty-two card deck is <br/>-<math>{{52 \choose 5} = 2598960}</math>.<br/>+The publication of Carson's book spawned the [[Environmental movement]] worldwide. By the 1970’s, the concern with the on-going environmental [[pollution]] caused by [[agrichemicals]] resulted in increased attention of alternative, non-chemical methods of farming which has today come to be known as [[organic farming]]. <br/> <br/>-===Combination with repetition===<br/>-When the order does not matter and an object can be chosen more than once, then the number of combinations is<br/>-<math>{{(n + r - 1)!} \over {r!(n - 1)!}} = {{n + r - 1} \choose {r}} = {{n + r - 1} \choose {n - 1}}</math><br/>-where ''n'' is the number of objects from which you can choose and ''r'' is the number to be chosen.  This can be visualised in the following way: Imagine a string of ''n'' symbols, from which we choose ''r'' examples. e.g. pick eight symbols from the list {a, b,c, d,e}.  We can rewrite this using the symbols '''1''' and '''/''', meaning 'choose one' and 'next symbol' respectively.  Therefore a choice of, say, {a, a,b, c,c, c,e, e} could be represented, starting at 'a', as {1,1,/,1,/,1,1,1,/,/,1,1}. ("Choose an 'a'; choose another 'a'; move on to the next symbol, 'b'; choose a 'b';" etc.) This is an equivalent to choosing ''n''&nbsp;−&nbsp;1 positions for the '''/''' symbol in a string of length (''n''&nbsp;−&nbsp;1)&nbsp;+&nbsp;''r'', where ''n'' = 5 and ''r'' = 8 in this example. Thus this problem is equivalent to choosing '''n''' - 1 positions from amongst ''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''r''&nbsp;−&nbsp;1, without repetition, and hence falls under a previously described case.<br/>-  <br/>-For example, if you have ten types of donuts to choose from and you want three donuts there are (10 + 3 − 1)! / 3! (10 − 1)! = 220 ways to choose (see also [[multiset]]).  <br/>+==Organic Fertilizers==<br/>+Steiner prescribed eight different preparations for [[fertilizer]]s which were allowed for use in biodynamic agriculture, and gave great details of how these were to be prepared. Inorganic or mineral fertilizers are not allowed. The substances are numbered 500 through 507, whereof the first two are used for preparing fields whereas the latter six are used for making [[compost]]:<br/>+<br/>+===Field preparations===<br/>+Field preparations, for stimulating humus formation:<br/>+<br/>+*500: (horn-manure) a humus mixture prepared by stuffing cow [[manure]] into the horn of a cow, bury this into the ground (40-60 cm below the surface) in the autumn and let it decompose during a winter.<br/>+*501: Crushed powdered [[quartz]] that can be mixed with 500 but usually prepared on its own (mixture of 1 tablespoon of quartz powder to 250 litres of water) The mixture is sprayed under very low pressure over the crop during the wet season to prevent fungal diseases. It should be sprayed on an overcast day to prevent burning of the leaves.<br/>+<br/>+Both 500 and 501 are used on fields by stirring the contents of a horn in 40-60 litres of water for an hour and whirling it in different directions every second minute. About 4 horns are used for each hectare of soil.<br/>+<br/>+===Compost preparations===<br/>+Compost preparations, used for preparing compost, employ herbs which are frequently used in medicinal remedies:<br/>+<br/>+*502: [[Yarrow]] blossoms (Achillea millefolium) are stuffed into [[urinary bladder]]s from Cervus elaphus, [[Red Deer]]s, placed in the sun during summer, buried in earth during winter and retrieved in the spring.<br/>+*503: [[Chamomile]] blossoms (Chamomilla officinalis) are stuffed into [[small intestine]]s from [[cattle]] buried in humus-rich earth in the autumn and retrieved in the spring.<br/>+*504: [[Stinging nettle]] (Urtica dioca, and the whole plant in full bloom) is stuffed together under ground surrounded on all sides by [[peat]] for a year.<br/>+*505: [[Oak]] bark (Quercus robur) is chopped in small pieces, placed inside the skull of some domesticated animal, surrounded by peat and buried in earth in a place where lots of rain water runs by.<br/>+*506: [[Dandelion]] flowers (Taraxacum officinale) is stuffed into [[peritoneum]] from some cattle is buried in earth during winter and retrieved in the spring.<br/>+*507: [[Valerian (plant)|Valerian]] flowers (Valeriana officinalis) is extracted into water.<br/>+<br/>+One to three grams (a teaspoon) of each preparation is added to a dung heap by digging 50 cm deep holes with a distance of 2 meters from each other, except for the 507 preparation, which is stirred into 5 litres of water and sprayed over the entire compost surface. All preparations are thus used in [[homeopathy|homeopathic]] quantities, and the only intent is to strengthen the life forces of the farm, i.e. the preparations fulfill spiritual goals and nothing else.<br/>+<br/>+===Homeopathic preparations===<br/>+The standard preparations 500-507 are added at a rate of 1 part preparation to 9 parts distilled water for an X (or D) potency or 1 part preparation to 99 parts distilled water for a C potency. They are succussed according to standard homeopathic practices. According to practitioners, this has the effect of transferring the energetic patterns from the preparations into the distilled water. The first step is called the mother tincture and 1 part of the mother tincture is added to 9 or 99 parts distilled water and successed to create a 1X or 1C dilution. Repeat again and it becomes a 2X or 2C dilution. The process is repeated as many times as necessary in order to create an appropriate dilution (ie. 30C). The correct dilution is up to the experience and intuition of the farmer just as it is up to the homeopathic doctor to give his patients the right dilution of medicine to treat them.<br/>+<br/>+==Dealing with pests and weeds==<br/>+Biodynamic agriculture use techniques reminiscent of the fertilization for [[pest control]] and [[weed control]], most of these techniques include using the ashes of a pest or weed that has been trapped or picked from the fields and ceremonially burnt. Steiner sees pests and weeds as a result of imbalance between life forces emanated from the earth.<br/>+<br/>+Since Steiner viewed the [[full moon]], [[Venus]] and [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] as cosmic powers influencing the fertility of plants, the biodynamic techniques for pest control involves blocking the fertility influence from said planets on different pests. Steiner dictates that this is achieved in different ways for pests and weeds:<br/>+<br/>+*Weeds are combated by collecting [[seed]]s from the weeds and burning them above a wooden flame. The ashes from the seeds are then spread on the fields, which will according to biodynamic philosophy block the influence from the full moon on the particular weed and make it infertile.<br/>+*Pests such as [[insect]]s or [[Apodemus]] ([[field mouse|field mice]]) have more complex processes associated with them depending on what pest is to be targeted. For example field mice are to be countered by deploying ashes prepared from field mice skin when [[Venus]] is in the [[scorpius]].<br/>+<br/>+==Skeptical view==<br/>+Opponents of biodynamic agriculture argue that there is nothing to be gained by following Steiner's teachings, and that similar or equal results can be obtained using standard [[organic farming]] principles. In particular, the use of religious and philosophical concepts, for example those of balance and harmony, beyond the conventional critical thinking of the Western world stand out as points of contention - as well as of interest.<br/>+<br/>+Many organic farmers believe that the practices of biodynamic agriculture more resemble [[alchemy]] or [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] akin to [[geomancy]].  Even though organic agriculture emerged at least in part from biodynamic agriculture, it is more of a burden to current practitioners of organic agriculture because many of the criticisms surrounding the supernatural characteristics of biodynamic agriculture are often conflated with the practices of organic agriculture.<br/>+<br/>+There have been some attempts to scientifically compare organic and biodynamic farming, and others comparing biodynamic and conventional farming. The differences with organic farming are generally small, those with conventional farming more significant.<br/>+<br/>+An April 16, 1993 a research article in ''Science'' magazine compared soil quality and financial performance of biodynamic and conventional farms in New Zealand. The article reported, "The Biodynamic farms proved in most enterprises to have soils of higher biological and physical quality: significantly greater in organic matter, content and microbial activity, more earthworms, better soil structure, lower bulk density, easier penetrability, and thicker topsoil." [http://www.sarep.ucdavis.edu/NEWSLTR/v6n2/sa-13.htm] <br/>+<br/>+The ''Science'' research indicated that earthworms -- which presumably have no knowledge of [[alchemy]], [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], or [[geomancy]] -- preferred the soil treated with biodynamic preparations 8 to 1, "From 30 soil cores (15 cm in diameter by 15 cm deep) taken on each paddock, we found Biodynamic farmed soil to average 175 earthworms per square meter to 21 earthworms per square meter on conventionally farmed soil." [http://www.sarep.ucdavis.edu/NEWSLTR/v6n2/sa-13.htm]<br/>+<br/>+This preference of earthworms for soil treated with biodynamic compost preparations reported in the ''Science'' research confirmed laboratory experiments conducted in 1938 by the noted soil scientist [[Ehrenfried Pfeiffer]] (1899-1961). Pfeiffer placed an equal number of earthworms (10) in four adjacent wooden-slat boxes containing the same substance: moist soil. Three boxes were each fertilized with a different compound: biodynamic compost, commercial mineral fertilizer, and urea. One box had no soil amendment. The slats meant that the earthworms could travel from box to box. The earthworms moved from the boxes containing untreated soil, mineral fertilizer and urea to the box with the soil and biodynamic compost. ''Soil Fertility, Renewal and Preservation'', Anthroposophic Press, NY, 1938, p. 150.<br/>+<br/>+==Certifying organizations==<br/>+The largest certification organisation for biodynamic farms is [[Demeter International]] and its national member organisations. Other certifying organisations exist; in the [[USA]] this has led to the BDA (Biodynamic Farming and Gardening Association, Inc.) who are responsible for the Demeter system in the U.S. and for the trademarked term ''biodynamic''.<br/>+<br/>+In [[France]] [[Biodivin]] certifies [[Biodynamic wine]].<br/>+<br/>+===Non-certified approaches using biodynamic principles===<br/>+<br/>+In the U.S., an opposing movement lead by Hugh Lovel and Greg Willis have opted out of the Demeter system as they found Demeter does not allow for certain things such as the homeopathic/biodynamic preparations made by Glen Atkinson, a New Zealand farmer. Homeopathic preparations are allowed in New Zealand Demeter system.<br/>+<br/>+Willis and Lovel use the terms 'Steiner's Agriculture' and 'Quantum Agriculture', respectively, rather than 'biodynamics'. Atkinson's approach is known as Garuda Biodynamics. In these systems the farmer uses appropriate homeopathic dilutions to treat and heal the farm organism.<br/>+<br/>+Greg Willis has developed new Steiner-like preparations including four versions of Horn Clay, Horn Basalt, Horn Sulfur, Horn Copper and the Comfrey Preparation. They are prepared in the same manner as Horn Manure (now Horn Humus) and Horn Silica (now called Horn Quartz). The Comfrey Preparation is made in the same manner as the Stinging Nettle Preparation. Greg Willis and Hugh Lovel have advocated including Horn Clay as one of the essential preparations. The other new preps are used to treat various imbalances and guide the growth of plants and crops. Greg Willis has now created 44 variations of Dr. Steiner's remedies. He claims this now gives the grower nearly complete control over diseases, insects, yield, quality, cost and profit.<br/>+<br/>+The remedies created by Glen Atkinson contain the original Steiner preparations, and are then diluted in the traditional homeopathic manner with alcohol. The Atkinson remedies, focus mainly on plant growth control and large pest control eg cats, possums and birds. The Atkinson BD remedies are the only remedies of the three, to have gained third party verification of their action, through replicated trials done by HortResearch in New Zealand.<br/>+<br/>+Those advocated by Hugh Lovel are prepared radionically on paper or sugar tablets. Greg Willis' preparations are made in purified spring water solutions which he believes are more compatible with plants than alcohol, sugar or paper.<br/>+<br/>+==Sources==<br/>+* [[Rudolf Steiner|Steiner, Rudolf]]: ''Spiritual Foundations for the Renewal of Agriculture: A Course of Lectures.''  , Bio-Dynamic Farming and Gardening Association, 1993, Kimberton, PA. 310 p, ISBN 093825037X<br/>+<br/>+* The Agriculture Course with commentary by Glen Atkinson  http://www.garudabd.org/Agriccourse/contents.html<br/>+<br/>+* "''Soil Quality and Financial Performance of Biodynamic and Conventional Farms in New Zealand''", John P.

That brought up one question, which I thought I'd ask here.<br/>-<br/>-In the [[Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal/Cases/2006-08-01_John_Prescott|John Prescott]] case, currently "new", the conflict was over salacious allegations about Prescott.  The case seems to have been resolved well.  However, if I'd been mediating, I'd have said some slightly different things than the mediator involved ([[User:CQJ]]).  This is not at all a criticism of CQJ; I'm trying to understand what approaches are thought to be best, and just where to draw the line between trying to help people come to an agreement, on the one hand, and letting them know when they are contravening WP policies, on the other.<br/>-<br/>-In this case the salacious allegations were that Prescott had a small penis.  One party to the mediation commented on the talk page that although that itself was not verifiable, the fact that the allegations were widely known and discussed in the UK, and that Prescott was an object of ridicule as a result, was indeed verifiable and worthy of inclusion.<br/>-<br/>-CQJ asked for sources before taking the case.  I think this was designed to remind the participants that the policies on [[WP:V|verifiability]] and [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] would apply, and short cut the discussion.  As I said above, this has apparently been successful.<br/>-<br/>-I agree that those two policies apply.  I think my reflex would have been to say that I'd take the case, and try to get agreement from the participants over the extent of the relevance of those policies to the proposed additional text.  Would that have been wrong?  CQJ's comment in the case made it clear he was amused, but willing to take it, and may have struck just the right note to defuse tension.  But I was surprised when I first saw it, because I wasn't expecting to see a mediator refuse to take a case.<br/>-<br/>-I'd be glad of any comments.  Thanks -- [[User:Mike Christie|Mike Christie]] 17:21, 9 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-:Well, we are an informal process so there are, of course, different ways about doing things. In that case in particular, with information such as that, especially on a living person per [[WP:LIVING]], [[WP:VERIFY|verifiability]] is key. If people went about insulting the size of his manhood and he stumbled upon the Wikipedia entry, I'm sure a firestorm would stir up. Your method could have worked too, I'm sure. I honestly don't think such information is relevant, but even if it was relevant, unless there is a verifiable source that says the belief is indeed true and it's been documented, verifiablility is often the most important thing in a biography of a living person (it should be on all articles, anyway). <font color="DarkGreen">[[User:Cowman109|Cowman109]]</font><sup>[[User talk:Cowman109|Talk]]</sup> 17:30, 9 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-::Wow, why didn't anyone come and get me? (laughing out loud).  Essentially, I took a look at everything, and the case was requested by...Wait for it....<br/>-<br/>-::Johnprescottssecretlovechild.<br/>-<br/>-::Case requested by a user whose sole intent was probably going to be to nail the [[John Prescott]] article with a bunch of garbage. I know that's not [[WP:AGF]], but a guy called Johnprescottssecretlovechild editing the [[John Prescott]] article, trying to say that he's got a large or nonexistent penis, well...you can see the humor in that :-). Like Cowman said, we have to be very careful with living biographical articles for our good, the Foundation's good, and the good of the person being covered, and everything must apply to [[WP:V]], [[WP:OR]], [[WP:NPA]], and [[WP:LIVING]].  I take a strict interpretation of the trifecta and most Wikipedia policy, including [[WP:IAR]], but in this case, [[WP:IAR]] would have probably gotten someone in some major trouble once Prescott's office found out, in addition, there's other users who need the help of the MedCab over someone who wants to add something about an MP's penis that can't meet verifiability or original research standards off the bat.  So I short-circuited the process and said the only way I'd work with it was to get three verifiable sources off the bat.  Bada bing, bada boom.

These affect the listing of the case - new is in new cases of course, open goes into the open cases section, and closed simply delists the case (we're still not archiving cases yet, so they're hiding in the closed cases category).<br/>-<br/>-'''Article''' Here you can list the name of the article, the source of the dispute. At the moment you just write the name of the article ''with'' <nowiki> [[ and ]] </nowiki> around it, so you can list multiple links if needed. This does not affect anything, but just lists the name of the article at the top of the case page.<br/>-<br/>-'''Requestor''', here you can put the name of the requester - once again, it's just to make the top of the page look nice and organized.<br/>-<br/>-'''Parties''', here you list the parties, same as above.<br/>-<br/>-'''Mediators''', the mediators listing shows up on the case list. Preferably you could use the format <nowiki>{{user|username}}</nowiki>, but anything works.<br/>-<br/>-'''Comment''', this also shows up on the case list. If you feel it is necessary, please put a short comment here about the status of the case, such as needs new mediator, or waiting for parties to respond. This is entirely optional, however, though in some cases it is good to signal to other mediators that there may be some help needed.<br/>-<br/>-And that's about it! Any questions?

Dinuzulu was held in such high esteem that he and his necklace were the inspiration for the [[Wood Badge]] program of leader training which was started by [[Robert Baden-Powell]].<br/> <br/>-[http://www.realityblurred.com/realitytv/archives/big_brother_7/2006_Jun_05_candidates_revealed| List of the 20 considered cast members?]<br/>+==Anglo-Zulu War==<br/>+He succeeded his father [[Cetshwayo]], who was the last king of the Zulus to be officially recognized as such by the [[Britain|British]]. [[Zululand]] had been broken up into 13 smaller territories after the [[Anglo-Zulu War]], and [[Cetshwayo]], and subsequently Dinuzulu, administered one of them. This was found to be unworkable, and the British restored Cetshwayo as paramount chief. However, they left one of Cetshwayo's sons, [[Usibepu]], alone with his lands intact. On [[July 22]], [[1883]] he attacked Cetshwayo's new [[kraal]] in Ulundi, wounding the king and causing him to flee.<br/> <br/>-Big Brother 7<br/>-Different lists of Big Brother All-Stars candidates accidentally revealed on CBS.com<br/>+==Dinuzulu's Volunteers==<br/>+To contest the succession Dinuzulu first appealed to the British, but had no response. He then offered rewards of land to [[Boer]] [[mercenaries]] who would come and fight on his side. In [[1884]] a group of [[Boer]] farmers from the districts of Utrecht and Vryheid undertook to restore order, in return for land for the formation of an independent republic. Led by General [[Louis Botha]], they formed Dinuzulu's Volunteers and after several clashes with Usibepu, defeated him at the [[Battle of Ghost Mountain]] (also known as the Battle of Tshaneni) on [[June 5]], [[1884]], killing Usibepu and his forces to the last man.<br/> <br/>-The 20 candidates for the all-star edition of Big Brother have been (apparently accidentally) revealed CBS.com. Strangely, the site is showing at least two separate lists of possible houseguests. (The list is supposed to be officially unveiled June 21, when viewers will be able to vote for their favorites from a group of 20; only the top six will enter the house, along with a group that producers select.)<br/>+The mercenaries then claimed payment and Dinuzulu found himself confronted with demands he could not meet. 800 mercenaries claimed to have fought for him and all claimed large farms. They claimed about half of Zululand, including St Lucia Bay, an outlet to the sea. Britain intervened and the mercenaries were given a grant of land in the northern part of Zululand. 500 mercenaries each received a farm of 16&nbsp;km&sup2;. Another 300 men who had arrived late received smaller grants, known as 'half farms'. On the [[5 August]] [[1884]], these mercenaries declared a republic, with the town of [[Vryheid]] as its capital, which lasted for only four years. After considerable dispute a Natal arbitration court recognised the New Republic, reduced in size, however, and deprived of its claims to St Lucia. The following year it was absorbed into the Transvaal. Thus Dinuzulu won the battle but lost a huge tract of land as a consequence.<br/> <br/>-At 6:09 p.m. ET, I went to the show’s official site and the following list of candidates, written in white text and formatted as a poll, came up instead of the show’s actual site, which was visible just moments earlier: <br/>+==Exile==<br/>+In [[1890]] Dinuzulu was exiled to the island of [[St. Helena]] for seven years for leading a Zulu army against the British from [[1883]] to [[1884]].<br/> <br/>-*Alison(BB4)<br/>-*Amy(BB3)<br/>-*Brittany(BB1)<br/>-*David(BB4)<br/>-*Diane(BB5)<br/>-*Drew(BB5)<br/>-*Erica(BB4)<br/>-*Jack(BB4)<br/>-*James(BB6)<br/>-*Janelle(BB6)<br/>-*Jason(BB3)<br/>-*Josh(BB3)<br/>-*Kaysar(BB6)<br/>-*Maggie(BB6)<br/>-*Mike(BB5)<br/>-*Monica(BB2)<br/>-*Nicole(BB2)<br/>-*Roddy(BB3)<br/>-*Shannon(BB2)<br/>-*Will(BB5)<br/>+==Bhambhata rebellion==<br/>+In [[1906]] the so-called [[Bhambhata rebellion]] broke out.

Concerning a fourth color, I don't see much need for one. But then, I am not familiar with the other series. I think if there is need for another element in the legend, it should probably be something other than a color, and be versatile enough to accomodate cases such as that of the veto.

However, how did people know who was going to be evicted before Thursday's show? Is it not really "live" as it purports to be? Is it just filmed earlier on the Thursday?

In the first few weeks, the votes are pretaped due to the volume of house guests. It would take a lot longer for 14 people to vote live. Therefore, most feeders are able to tell through discussions and pre-eviction strategy. For example, feeders knew that Nakomis was going to go because Kaysar informed his alliance that they did not have the votes do they should "dump them". This meant they should forget trying to save Dedmon and, instead, tip the votes in favor of keeping Diane. Since feeders already knew of Danielle's (she made a deal), Jase's (hated Dedmon), and Marcellas' (promised Diane a vote against Dedmon) votes we just add two Season 5 votes and the votes end up being at least 5-5 for a tie. So, to make it a short answer: they watch the feeds, cobble together information from prvate talks, and make their best guess from what was said.

Since some people seem to get off on posting information the second it happens, the infobox should probably be moved down the page, or removed altogether.  Otherwise it is possible to come to this page on Monday, read the spoiler warning and intend to leave so you don't spoil the show, but then glance to the right and see a big veto symbol next to boogie's name.

I just want there to be some way to have the spoiler warning mean something.  As it stands, I can't go to this article at all because the infobox at the very top gives away all the possible spoiler information.  This is an issue that will continue for each new season of BB, so I think it should be taken care of.  If it is possible to allow the current infobox to stay the same, yet be hidden by default, I vote for that. [[User:Cjosefy|Cjosefy]] 19:07, 3 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-::Having the infobox collapsed by default is unnecessary, in my opinion. Anyone who is concerned about absolute up-to-date info on the house status can just as easily scroll down to ''Nominations and evictions''. With something as visible as the infobox, I look at it from the perspective that it's not official until it's broadcast on television. I think it'd be a decent courtesy to hold off on updating the infobox until after the Pacific broadcast.

ATL has been manufacturing the Pinzgauer since the year 2000. Before then the Pinzgauer was produced by [[Steyr-Daimler-Puch]] in [[Graz, Austria]] (hence the name, based on an [[Pinzgauer (horse)|Austrian breed of horse]]).<br/> <br/>-'''Watford Football Club''' are an [[England|English]] professional [[football (soccer)|football]] club based in [[Watford]], [[Hertfordshire]].  As of the 2006&ndash;2007 season, they will play in the [[FA Premier League]], the top tier of the English football league system. They were promoted to the Premiership after a 3-0 victory over {{fc|Leeds United}} in the Championship play-off final on [[21 May]] [[2006]].<br/>+__TOC__<br/> <br/>-The club was founded in [[1881]], firstly playing at Cassio Road ground, before moving to [[Vicarage Road]] in [[1922]], where they remain to this day. Since [[1997]] they have shared the ground with [[Saracens F.C.|Saracens Rugby Club]]. The club has the nickname of “'''The Hornets''',” because of its yellow and black strip. Watford have a long-standing rivalry with nearby [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]].<br/>+==First generation==<br/>+[[Image:Puch-p1020657.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Pinzgauer 710M (first generation)]]<br/>+<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Pinzgauer 712M.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Pinzgauer 712M (first generation)]] --><br/>+<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Pinzgauer_Dimensions.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Pinzgauer 710M & 712M Dimensions]] --><br/> <br/>-The club is best known for its two spells under the management of former [[England national football team|England]] manager [[Graham Taylor (football manager)|Graham Taylor]]. The first lasting from [[1977]] to [[1987]], when the club rose to the old [[Football League First Division|Division One]] from [[Football League Fourth Division|Division Four]], also reaching the [[FA Cup]] final in [[1984]] and competing in the [[UEFA Cup]]. The second lasting from [[1997]] to [[2001]], when Taylor took the club from [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]] to the [[FA Premier League|Premiership]] in successive seasons. During both of these eras the club was owned by [[Elton John]], who is now the club's honorary life president.<br/>-  <br/>-==History==<br/>-===The Graham Taylor era (1977&ndash;1987)===<br/>-When 32-year-old Graham Taylor was named as Watford's new manager at the start of the 1976&ndash;1977 season, the club had just been purchased by world famous pop star [[Elton John]] (a lifelong fan of the club) and were an ungainly Fourth Division side. But thanks to the efforts of chairman, manager and playing staff, Watford had reached the First Division by the start of the [[1982-83 in English football|1982&ndash;83]] season. Players like [[John Barnes (football player)|John Barnes]], [[Ross Jenkins]] and [[Luther Blissett (footballer)|Luther Blissett]] were some of the most respected players in the English game during the 1980s. Watford finished their first top flight season as runners-up behind champions [[Liverpool F.C|Liverpool]]. The club competed in the UEFA cup the following season and an FA Cup final appearance followed in 1984, although Watford lost to [[Everton F.C|Everton]]. After guiding Watford to a ninth-place finish in 1986&ndash;1987, Taylor was lured away to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and his successor Dave Bassett was dismissed after eight months in charge after a terrible start to the 1987&ndash;88 season.<br/>-[[Image:Watford2.gif|thumb|200px|'''Watford F.C.''' badge in the 1970s.]]<br/>+The original [[prototype]] was produced in [[1965]] and production began in [[1971]], as successor of the [[Haflinger]]. This first generation model was produced until [[1985]] by [[Steyr-Daimler-Puch]].<br/> <br/>-===Life outside the top division (1987&ndash;1998)===<br/>-Watford were relegated from the First Division at the end of the 1987&ndash;1988 season, and lost in the following season's Second Division playoffs. Over the next few seasons, Watford never seriously challenged for promotion. Their highest finish was a Craig Ramage-inspired seventh in Division One at the end of the 1994&ndash;1995 season, but they were relegated the following year.<br/>+The Pinzgauer is one of the most capable all-terrain vehicles ever made.  It isn't as fast as a [[HMMWV]] but it can climb over rougher terrain and carry more payload. Even the smaller 710M can carry 10 people, or two [[NATO]] pallets.  It can also tow 11,000&nbsp;kg. It can drive 800 km on one tank of fuel and 2000 km with additional tanks.  The first generation Pinzgauer is available in both [[four-wheel drive]] (model '''710''') and [[six-wheel drive]] (model '''712''') versions.<br/> <br/>-The club did win the [[FA Youth Cup]] in the 1988-89 season, beating [[Manchester City F.C.|Man City]] 2-1 after extra time; [[David James (footballer)|David James]] was in goal for the Hornets.<br/>+The Pinzgauer was also designed to be reliable and easy to fix.  That is why it comes with an air-cooled [[carburetor|carbureted]] engine.  Air-cooled carbureted engines are still in use in many small aircraft due to their reliability.  This is partially due to the fact that air-cooled engines have been around longer, and partially due to the fact that they are simpler and have fewer parts. The engine in the pinzgauer is a special engine designed specially for it. It has more than one oil pump so that the engine will not get starved of oil no matter the orientation.<br/> <br/>-===The return of Graham Taylor (1998&ndash;2001)===<br/>-Graham Taylor returned to Watford as Director of Football in February 1996, with former player Kenny Jackett as head coach, but was unable to stop the club from sliding into Division Two. After a mid-table finish in Division Two at the end of 1996&ndash;1997, Jackett was demoted to the position of assistant manager and Taylor returned his old role as manager. The transition proved a success and Watford secured the Division Two championship in 1997&ndash;1998, beating [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] into second place after a season-long struggle. A second successive promotion followed in 1998&ndash;1999, thanks to a playoff final victory over [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton]] which secured the club's promotion to the Premiership.  The Premiership season started brightly with an early surpising victory over [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], but soon faded away, and Watford were relegated after finishing bottom.  Graham Taylor retired at the end of the 2000&ndash;2001 season (although just months later he returned to football management at [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]), and was replaced in a surprise move by [[Gianluca Vialli]], who had recently been sacked by [[Chelsea F.C.]]<br/>+It also has a very advanced chassis that gives it its high mobility.  It has a central tube chassis with a [[transaxle]] which distributes the weight more evenly and keeps the center of gravity as low as possible. The [[differential (mechanics)|differentials]] are all sealed units and never require additional lubrication. The pinzgauer also has [[portal axles]] just like the HMMWV, Hummer H1, and [[Unimog]] to provide extra clearance over obstacles. The 710 4x4 was the more popular variant, but the pinzgauer was designed to have a very capable 6x6 configuration from the start. The rear suspension on the back of the 6x6 712 is designed to provide maximum traction in the most demanding circumstances.<br/> <br/>-===Watford under Vialli (2001&ndash;2002)===<br/>-Vialli's time at the club was short and unhappy.  In an unpopular move he replaced long-time backroom staff such as [[Kenny Jackett]] and [[Luther Blissett (footballer)|Luther Blissett]], replacing them with ex-Chelsea staff he had brought with him.  Vialli made several high-profile signings, and wage bills at the club soared, with Vialli himself earning almost a million pounds a year.  However, the season was mediocre, with the club finishing a lowly 14th in the division, and Vialli was sacked after only one season, having refused to resign.  He was replaced by [[Ray Lewington]], who had come to the club the previous summer as Vialli's reserve team manager.<br/>+During production from 1971 until 1985 18,349 first-generation 710s and 712s were produced and sold to both Civilian and Government buyers.<br/> <br/>-===Ray Lewington (2002&ndash;2005)===<br/>-<br/>-Lewington took charge of Watford for the 2002&ndash;2003 season. Over the summer many of the Vialli's signings left the club. Lewington had few funds to strengthen the side and was only able to bring in two players, the experienced Neal Ardley and Sean Dyche.  The extent of Watford's financial difficulties was exposed in the autumn, along with many League clubs, following the collapse of [[ITV Digital]].  Exacerbating the club's difficulties were the large payoffs they had had to make to Vialli and several players on terminating their contracts, and Vialli's decision to sue the club early in 2003.  The club's started the season well, however, despite the players having to agree to a pay-cut during October, and finished in mid-table. An unexpected run to the [[FA Cup]] semi-final, where Watford lost to Premiership [[Southampton FC|Southampton]], also generated vital cash.  <br/>-<br/>-The ongoing financial difficulties saw a large number of players released that summer, including record signing Allan Nielsen and strikers Tommy Smith and Gifton Noel-Williams. There was a degree of hope around the new strike-force. Danny Webber - who had previously impressed on loan - was signed in a deal financied by several directors, along with Manchester United youngster Jimmy Davis, on loan for the season, and former star Bruce Dyer. <br/>-<br/>-Tragically, however, Davis was killed in a car-crash on the opening day of the campaign. This had a huge effect on the team's form at the beginning of the season, and notably on Webber, who was one of his closest friends. Hovering above the relegation zone, the team struggled on through the winter. Terrace hero Paul Robinson was sold for the relatively small sum of £250,000, after a bid from [[West Bromwich Albion FC| West Brom]]. Non-league signing Scott Fitzgerald scoring many of the team's goals in a make-shift attack, with Gavin Mahon, who had a poor 2002&ndash;2003, made a significant contribution in the centre of midfield. A strong finish to the season, led by winger Lee Cook, saw the club finish in mid-table.<br/>-<br/>-The 2004&ndash;2005 season saw a continuation of the good form of the end of the previous season, with the club well in the upper half of the Championship at the end of September.  However, a long run of poor form subsequently saw the club drop steadily towards the relegation zone.  Another good cup run further eased the club's financial position, with the team reaching the semi-final of the [[League Cup]], soundly beating Premiership sides [[Portsmouth FC|Portsmouth]] and [[Southampton FC|Southampton]] on the way, before losing narrowly to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. The club's poor league form, however, came to a head in March, with a run of terrible performances and Lewington was sacked on the 22nd. His sacking was controversial, and many fans were unhappy at the loss of a man who had led the club to two cup semi finals in three seasons, enduring considerable financial hardships.<br/>-<br/>-===Adrian Boothroyd (2005&ndash;present)===<br/>-Adrian Boothroyd (35) was appointed manager after serving at [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] as a coach, and 70-year-old [[Keith Burkinshaw]] was recruited as his assistant. His inexperience provoked concerns among fans, who worried that he would not be able to keep the side up. However, Watford secured enough points to ensure survival with two games to go.<br/>-<br/>-Fan dissent continued throughout the summer; moreover the sacking of the legendary Nigel Gibbs as coach after more than twenty years of loyal service provoked more anger, along with the departure of a large number of fans' favourites. Among those to go were star striker Heiðar Helguson (to [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] for £1.3m) and Danny Webber (to [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] for £500k) leaving the club with only one recognised striker. <br/>-<br/>-In a flurry of late-August activity Boothroyd signed strikers [[Darius Henderson]] and [[Marlon King]] (initially on a season-long loan, signed on contract January 2006), central defenders [[Clarke Carlisle]] and [[Malky Mackay]], midfielder [[Matthew Spring]] and goalkeeper [[Ben Foster (footballer)|Ben Foster]] (also on a season-long loan), assauging many fans doubts about the thinness of the squad.<br/>-<br/>-Although Watford lost the opening match of the season 2-1 at home to Preston North End, Boothroyd's first full season at the club subsequently saw strong performances from the team to take them into the top half of the Championship, with the side consistently maintaining a third place position. A strong run of form in early 2006, including an impressive win at second-placed [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] saw the club threatening to take second place and an automatic promotion spot. A subsequent down-turn in form rendered this impossible, but a draw at home against [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] on [[9 April]] secured Watford a play-off spot.<br/>-<br/>-Following a 3-0 away victory at [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] and a subsequent 0-0 draw at Vicarage Road in the semi-finals Watford reached the playoff final at the [[Millennium Stadium]] in Cardiff. Watford then beat [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds]] 3-0 in the final with goals from [[Jay DeMerit]], an own goal by Leeds' goalkeeper [[Neil Sullivan]], and a penalty from [[Darius Henderson]] to gain promotion to the Premier League and an estimated £41m as a result (all 13,000 available seasons tickets were quickly sold out). So far, this money has been spent on several players, including [[Damien Francis]] (£1.5m), [[Danny Shittu]] (£1.6m) and [[Tam%C3%A1s Priskin]] (£1m) to strengthen his [[FA Premiership|Premiership]] squad.<br/>-<br/>-==Rivalry==<br/>-Watford fans maintain a rivalry with those of [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]], which has, somewhat surprisingly, been described by FourFourTwo magazine as the fiercest local rivalry in English football. The two sides met regularly in the Southern and Football Leagues from 1900 to 1937, but Luton's promotion meant that aside from a Southern Cup meeting the two sides didn't meet again until 1964. Throughout the sixties and seventies the two sides met sporadically, and the rivalry gradually grew in significance, bringing with it trouble in the ground and outside of it. The two sides were promoted to the First Division in the 1981&ndash;1982 season, with Luton taking the Championship ahead of Watford. The two sides were also relegated together from the new Division 1 in 1995&ndash;1996. Watford's promotion from Division 2 in 1997&ndash;1998 meant that the two sides did not meet again in the League until the 2005&ndash;2006 season, when Luton were promoted into the Championship. Clashes in the nineties had seen a decrease in violence, but a one-off League Cup tie in the 2002&ndash;2003 was marred by violence inside Vicarage Road, as Luton fans spilled onto the pitch encouraging a mass brawl[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/2249877.stm]. The two clubs first League meeting in eight years, on [[2 January]] [[2006]], passed largely without incident with Watford winning 2-1 at [[Kenilworth Road]].

and other countries is to import first generation Pinzgauers for individual use.  Any Pinzgauer can be imported, but due to the high cost and the difficulty in certifying them the second generation Pinzgauers are very rarely imported.  First generation Pinzgauers are often imported because they are widely available and thus cheaper. Both Switzerland and Austria have released many 1st generation pinzgauers into the civilian marketplace as they converted their fleet to newer trucks. Likewise, 1st generation Pinzgauers sold to civilians in Europe are occasionally found and imported.<br/> <br/>-{{FA_Premier_League}}<br/>+Vehicles over 25 years old are much easier to import due a rolling 25 year exemption to DOT regulations and a rolling 21 year exemption for EPA requirements. The 1st generation pinzgauers were equipped with typical safety equipment for that era: Seat Belts, Emergency Flashers, etc and have no difficulty meeting US standards for vehicles of that age. In many aspects the Pinzgauer was better equipped from a safety perspective than many contemporary 4x4 (Jeeps, Land-rovers, etc) coming from the factory with seat belts, power brakes, integral roll bars, and other safety focused design features. Like most 4x4's from the 70's and early 80's, you do have to be aware of the higher center of gravity similar to Land-cruisers, Trooper, Explorers, Bronco's, Blazer's, and CJ-5 Jeeps. As with the other 4x4's of that era, it is possible to tip them if driven aggressively or inappropriately. But most will find the Pinzgauer to be as safe or safer than its contemporaries due to the high quality of engineering the SDP factory utilized.<br/> <br/>-[[Category:English football clubs]]<br/>-[[Category:FA Premier League]]<br/>-[[Category:Sport in Hertfordshire]]<br/>-[[Category:Watford F.C.]]<br/>-[[Category:FA Premier League clubs]]<br/>-[[Category:Publicly Traded Sports Companies]]<br/>-[[Category:1881 establishments]]<br/>+The first generation trucks are popular with off-roaders world-wide due to their low cost and their ability in off-roading.

In the year [[2000]] [[Magna International|Magna]], who bought [[Steyr-Daimler-Puch]] sold its rights to the Pinzgauer to [[Automotive Technik]] in the UK. They took over production of the Pinzgauer and still make it to this day.<br/>+<br/>+The [[four-wheel-drive]] Model is now called a '''716''' and the six-wheel-drive model is now called a '''718'''. The same letter body type designations apply.  The new 716 has the same payload rating as the old 712, and the new 718 also has a similarly higher payload capacity.<br/>+<br/>+There were a few minor changes to the design of the Pinzgauer:<br/>+* [[Straight-6|Inline 6 cylinder]] [[Volkswagen]] [[Turbocharger|turbo]] [[Diesel engine|diesel engine]]<br/>+* Slightly wider track<br/>+* Slightly bigger [[tire]]s<br/>+* [[Disk brake]]s<br/>+* Standard [[automatic transmission]] with optional [[manual transmission]]<br/>+<br/>+The second generation [[vehicle]] went through several minor revisions through its life, unlike the first generation which used the same design throughout production. The first second-generation Pinzgauers were designated '''P80''' (1980). It went through a revision in 1990 ('''P90'''), 1993 ('''P93'''), and an [[engine]] change in [[2002]].  This was a new [[Volkswagen]] [[Turbo Direct Injection|TDI]] engine that met the new Euro III [[emissions]] requirements.<br/>+<br/>+==Worldwide markets==<br/>+The Pinzgauer is used quite widely in the [[United Kingdom]] as a fire engine in smaller towns and villages and is increasingly replacing the [[Land Rover]] Defender in the [[military]] utility [[vehicle]] role despite its high cost of upwards of US$100,000 per unit.<br/>+<br/>+Many Pinzgauers were sold to military forces (initially [[Austria]]n and Swiss) to be used as non-tactical utility vehicles. Typical military roles are as general purpose utility truck, command vehicles, troop carrier, [[ambulance]], and tow vehicle. Roles very similar to other civilian sourced CUCV vehicles like Land-Rover in the UK, the Blazer CUCV in the US, and Geländewagen in many European countries.<br/>+<br/>+The Pinzgauer was also marketed to the civilian marketplace world-wide for use as campers, farm trucks, ambulances, fire-trucks, and rescue vehicles. Likewise, many ended up being used as tourist vans due to their large passenger capacity and stable, reliable platform. Pinzgauers have been used as tourist transports in Africa, Australia, South America, Hawaii, and other exotic locales. Some are still in use today. Pinzgauers were also marketed to and used extensively by energy companies for oil exploration purposes. A few pinzgauers were used for off-road racing, including the famous Paris to Dakar Rally.<br/>+<br/>+Similar-purposed vehicles include the [[Germany|German]] [[Daimler-Benz]] [[Unimog]] and [[Geländewagen]] trucks, the British [[Land Rover Wolf]], and the [[United States|American]] [[HMMWV]] "Humvee".<br/>+<br/>+==Pinzgauer capabilities==<br/>+{| align=right<br/>+| <!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Pinzgauer 710M 45-Degrees.jpg|right|150px]]  -->|| <!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Pinzgauer 710M 100 Slope.jpg|right|150px]] --><br/>+|-<br/>+| <!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Pinzgauer 710M 700mm Fording.jpg|right|150px]]  -->|| <!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Pinzgauer 710M 335mm HighCentre.jpg|right|150px]] --><br/>+|-<br/>+|}<br/>+The Pinzgauer is a remarkable offroad [[vehicle]].

[[John P. Meier]] (1991, p. 174) describes the purpose behind this criterion : <br/>-:The criterion of multiple attestation (or "the cross section") focuses on those sayings or deeds of Jesus that are attested in more than one independent literary source (e.g., Mark, Q, Paul, John) and/or in more than one literary form or genre (e.g., parable, dispute story, miracle story, prophecy, aphorism). The force of this criterion is increased if a given motif or theme is found in both different literary sources and different literary forms.<br/>+'''Patricia Cornwell''' (born '''Patricia Carroll Daniels''' on [[June 9]], [[1956]]) is a contemporary [[United States|American]] author. Cornwell is widely known for writing a popular series of [[crime fiction|crime novels]], featuring the fictional heroine "Dr. Kay Scarpetta", a [[medical examiner]]. <br/> <br/>-Multiple attestation has a certain kind of objectivity. Given the ''independence'' of the sources, satisfaction of the criterion makes it harder maintain that it was an invention of the Church.  Still, this criterion, however useful, is rarely used by itself, and is typically one of a number of criteria, such as the criterion of discontinuity and the [[criterion of embarrassment]], along with the [[historical method]].<br/>+== Biographical information ==<br/>+A descendant of [[abolitionist]] and writer [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]], Cornwell was born in [[Miami, Florida]]. Cornwell says that there are numerous link between herself and the main character in her novels, Dr. Kay Scarpetta, a forensic pathologist. They are both Miami-born, both divorced, both worked in forensic science and both had troubled relationships with their late fathers. (Cornwell's father, Sam Daniels, was one of the leading appellate lawyers in the United States and served as a law clerk to [[Supreme Court]] Justice [[Hugo Black]].) <br/> <br/>-==Examples of its use==<br/>-According to Meier (1991, p. 175), the "[[kingdom of God]]" ''motif'' appears in "Mark, Q, special Matthean tradition, special Lucan tradition, and John, with echoes in Paul, despite the fact that 'kingdom of God' is not Paul's preferred way of speaking."  It  appears in an array of literary genres.   <br/>-The striking ''words'' attributed to Jesus on the bread and wine during the [[Last Supper]] (found in [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]], and [[Gospel of John|John]]) and on divorce (found in Mark and Paul) are examples of sayings that are independently attested. <br/>+In ''Body of Evidence'', the second of the Kay Scarpetta novels, Scarpetta says that her career in pathology can be traced back to "the terrible crime of my father's death." Cornwell, in a interview with ''[[The Times]]'' of London, traced her own motivations in life to the psychological abuse she says she suffered from her father, who she says walked out on the family on Christmas Day in 1952. "He was very analytical and had a pristine, sharp mind, but his problem was that emotionally he was unable to connect with people, and could be very cruel," she told her interviewer. A sociopath? the interviewer asked. "I don't know what his diagnosis would be, but he didn’t seem to feel much remorse when he did very harmful things. He wasn’t even nice to me on his deathbed. We knew it was the last time we’d see each other; he grabbed my brother's hand and mouthed 'I love you', but he never touched me. All he did was write on a legal pad 'How’s work?'"[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,923-1905305_1,00.html]<br/> <br/>-An example of an ''event'' that is multiply attested is Jesus's meeting with [[John the Baptist]] (found in Mark and John).  <br/>+Cornwell told ''The Times'' that her first interaction with the legal system came at the age of 5, when she appeared before a grand jury to give evidence against a neighborhood security guard who "was getting started on some activity that would not have been very good if my brother hadn't ridden up on his bicycle and scared him away."<br/> <br/>-An example of a ''relation'' is Jesus having brothers, found in Mark and John (Meier, 1991, p. 317).<br/>+Soon afterwards, Cornwell's family moved to [[Montreat]], [[North Carolina]], where her mother was hospitalized for [[clinical depression|depression]] and the children were placed in the foster care system. By her late teens, Cornwell told ''The Times'', she was [[anorexic]] and suffered from depression. [[Billy Graham]]'s wife, Ruth Bell, encouraged Cornwell to write, she says. “The things that happened to me propelled me in a direction of realizing that I must be able to take care of myself because nobody else was going to,” she said. “I didn't want to feel powerless again. Whether it's being molested at 4 or being in foster homes, you have no control.”<br/> <br/>-==Limitations==<br/>-This criterion cannot be used for sources that are not independent. For example, a saying that occurs in all three [[Synoptic Gospels]] may only represent one source. Under the [[two-source hypothesis]], both the authors of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] and the [[Gospel of Luke]] used the Gospel of Mark in their writings; therefore, triple- tradition material only represents a single source, Mark. (The [[Augustinian hypothesis]] posits that Mark and Luke used Matthew, so once again triple-tradition material would have originated in a single source). Another limitation is that some sayings or deeds attributed to Jesus could have originated in the first Christian communities early enough in the tradition to be attested to by a number of independent sources, thus not representing the [[historical Jesus]]. Finally, there are some sayings or deeds of Jesus that only appear in one form or source that scholars still consider historically probable. Multiple attestation is not always a requisite for historicity, nor is it enough to determine accuracy by itself. The criterion is one of many factors to help scholars establish whether a tradition is likely to be historical.<br/>+Shortly after graduating from [[Davidson College]], she married one of her English professors, Charles Cornwell, who was 17 years her senior. Professor Cornwell left his tenured professorship to become a preacher, and Patricia began writing a biography of Ruth Bell Graham. That biography, ''A Time for Remembering'' (renamed ''Ruth, A Portrait: The Story of Ruth Bell Graham'' in subsequent editions) was published in 1983.In 1979, Cornwell started working as a reporter for ''[[The Charlotte Observer]]'' and soon began covering crime. In 1984, she took a job at the Virginia Medical Examiner's office. For six years she worked there, first as a technical writer and then as a computer analyst. She also volunteered to work with the Richmond Police Department. In 1989, Cornwell and her husband divorced.<br/>+<br/>+In the 1980s, Cornwell wrote three novels that she says were rejected before the publication, in 1991, of her first major success, ''Postmortem.'' After the success of ''Postmortem,'' Cornwell bought five houses and many cars in one year. Then, after an evening out with actress [[Demi Moore]], who was visiting to discuss playing Scarpetta in a film, Cornwell crashed her Mercedes, was convicted of drunk-driving and sentenced to 28 days in a treatment center. <ref name=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9400E4D8143BF930A15750C0A961958260&sec=health&pagewanted=1]</ref> <br/>+<br/>+In the early 1990s, Cornwell had a lesbian affair, between 1991 and 1992, with a former [[FBI]] forensics instructor, Marguerite Bennett. Bennett left the FBI after she admitted that she had lied under oath to protect her husband, FBI agent Eugene Bennett, who had been accused of filing fraudulent expense claims. On May 15, 1997, Eugene Benett was sentenced to 23 years in prison by a court in Prince William County, Virginia, for trying to kill his wife, whom he accused of deserting him for a lesbian relationship with Cornwell. The effort, according to ''The New York Times'', was said to include a plan to kill his wife, collect $1 million in insurance and get custody of the couple's two daughters. Mrs. Bennett testified that she and Ms. Cornwell had ''two intimate contacts'' but said the relationship had nothing to do with her divorce. <ref name=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=990DE7DD1238F935A25756C0A961958260&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fOrganizations%2fF%2fFederal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation%20</ref><br/>+<br/>+Cornwell has spent millions of dollars buying art, clothing and other materials, and then having forensic tests, including DNA testing, conducted in an effort to prove that the painter [[Walter Sickert]] was [[Jack the Ripper]]. In 2002, she published ''Portrait of a Killer. Jack the Ripper: Case Closed''. Despite her considerable effort in making the case, art historians and Ripperolgists consider the case wide open.<br/>+<br/>+After studying the criminal brain for her 2005 book, ''Predator'', Cornwell said she reversed her position in support of the [[death penalty]] and concluded that the mind is formed by nature and nuture acting upon each other, which does not mean that someone is chemically doomed to become a psychopathic murderer. In her interview with ''The Times'', Cornwell used similar concepts to describe herself, saying that she was “wired differently”, in a direct reference to her struggle with bipolar disorder.  “My wiring’s not perfect and there are ways that you can stabilise that. I have certain things that run in my own ancestry," she told ''The Times'', adding, "It’s not unusual for great artistic people to have bipolar disorder, for example. The diagnosis goes back and forth but I’m pretty sure that I am. I take a mood stabili[z]er.” As a teenager she suffered from [[anorexia nervosa|anorexia]].<br/>+<br/>+Cornwell has made several notable charitable acts, including funding scholarships to the [[University of Tennessee]]'s National Forensics Academy, [[Davidson College]]'s Creative Writing Program, and donating her collection of [[Walter Sickert]] paintings to [[Harvard University]].<br/>+<br/>+== Her writing ==<br/>+<br/>+The Scarpetta novels include a great deal of detail on [[forensics]]. The solution to the mystery usually is found in the forensic investigation of the murder victim's corpse, although Scarpetta does considerably more field investigation and confrontation with suspects than real-life medical examiners.  The novels are considered to have influenced the development of popular [[TV series]] on forensics, both fictional, such as ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'', and documentaries, such as ''[[Cold Case Squad]]''. <br/>+ <br/>+Procedural details are part of the allure of her novels. Cornwell herself worked at a crime lab in [[Virginia]] as a technical writer and computer analyst but not in any official medical or forensics capacity. Her attempts to portray herself as an expert in those fields have caused some bad feelings from those who have actual training and licensing, including [[Kathy Reichs]], who is both a board-certified [[forensic anthropologist]] and a crime novelist.<br/>+<br/>+Other significant themes in the Scarpetta novels include health in general; individual safety and security; food; and family. Although scenes from the novels take place in a variety of locations around the U.S. and (less commonly) internationally, the city of [[Richmond, Virginia]] is featured prominently.<br/>+<br/>+Besides the Scarpetta novels, Cornwell has written three more light-hearted police fictions featuring Andy Brazil, as well as a number of works of non-fiction.<br/>+<br/>+Cornwell is the recipient of numerous prizes for crime writing, including the Edgar, Britain's Gold Dagger Award and the Sherlock Award.

See ''[[Portrait of a Killer]]'' for further information. However, Cornwell denies a Jack the Ripper obsession in full-page ads in two British newspapers.

In [[2000]] he sent letters to Cornwell's publisher, started a page on the World Wide Web, and placed stickers on his novel in order to claim that Cornwell was committing [[plagiarism]]. Cornwell successfully obtained a preliminary [[injunction]] against Sachs. The court ruled that his claims were baseless, and he was prevented from placing the stickers on his book. The court also required that booksellers remove the stickers that were already there and shut his website down for false advertising. [http://www.prenhall.com/girasa/updates/ch10.html].<br/>+<br/>+Sachs left the country so that he could escape the injunction. He continues to charge that Cornwell plagiarized his work and used her influence to subvert justice.<br/>+<br/>+== List of works ==<br/>+<br/>+Note: these are Scarpetta novels unless otherwise noted.<br/>+<br/>+*''[[A Time for Remembering]]'' (1983; non-fiction; biography of [[Ruth Bell Graham]]; later reissued as ''[[Ruth: A Portrait]]'')<br/>+*''[[Postmortem (novel)|Postmortem]]'' (1990) <br/>+*''[[Body of Evidence (novel)|Body of Evidence]]'' (1991) <br/>+*''[[All That Remains (novel)|All That Remains]]'' (1992) <br/>+*''[[Cruel and Unusual]]'' (1993) <br/>+*''[[The Body Farm (novel)|The Body Farm]]'' (1994) <br/>+*''[[From Potter's Field]]'' (1995) <br/>+*''[[Cause of Death (novel)|Cause of Death]]'' (1996) <br/>+*''[[Hornet's Nest]]'' (1997; Andy Brazil) <br/>+*''[[Unnatural Exposure]]'' (1997) <br/>+*''[[Point of Origin (novel)|Point of Origin]]'' (1998) <br/>+*''[[Scarpetta's Winter Table]]'' (1998)<br/>+*''[[Black Notice]]'' (1999) <br/>+*''[[Southern Cross (novel)|Southern Cross]]'' (1999; Andy Brazil)<br/>+*''[[Life's Little Fable]]'' (1999; children's book)<br/>+*''[[The Last Precinct]]'' (2000)<br/>+*''[[Isle Of Dogs (novel)]]'' (2001; Andy Brazil)<br/>+*''[[Food to Die For: Secrets from Kay Scarpetta's Kitchen]]'' (2002; non-fiction)<br/>+*''[[Portrait of a Killer|Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed]]'' (2002; non-fiction)  <br/>+*''[[Blow Fly (novel)|Blow Fly]]'' (2003) <br/>+*''[[Trace (novel)|Trace]]'' (2004)<br/>+*''[[Predator (novel)|Predator]]'' (2005)<br/>+*''[[At Risk]]'' (2006) (non-Scarpetta, originally a serialization for [[The New York Times]])<br/>+*''[[Book of the Dead (novel)|Book of the Dead]]'' (2006)<br/> <br/> ==References==<br/>-*[[Bart D.

Most, however, can be split up into [[Indo-Aryan]] groups, such as the [[Punjabis]], [[Gujaratis]], [[Bengalis]], etc, who descend primarily from [[India's]] early [[Aryan]] migrants; and the [[Dravidian]] groups, ie; [[Tamils]], [[Andhras]], etc who are descended from an earlier wave of invaders who may have had a hand in the beginnings of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. Both of these have, however, been modified by intermarriages with each other and with later, post-Aryan invaders such as the [[Scythians]], the [[Greeks]], the [[Kushans]], the [[Parthians]] and the [[Huns]]. Besides these two, there are many tribal groups who descend from some of [[India's]] earliest inhabitants such as the [[Santals]] and the [[Nagas]]. Some [[Indian Muslims]] have some descent to [[India's]] [[Muslim]] invaders and immigrants such as the [[Arabs]], the [[Mughals]], the [[Persians]] and the [[Afghans]]. Descendents of [[Persian]] [[Zoroastrian]] refugees, the [[Parsis]] can be found primarily in [[Mumbai]], the state of [[Gujarat]] and some other cities of [[India]]. Various, somewhat sizeable [[Jewish]] communities of [[Middle Eastern]] descent used to reside in [[India's]] western cities but have today mostly left for [[Israel]], with only about 5,000 remaining.

Nowhere in his piece is such an argument made, which is similarly repeated in the summary of his views. The main thrust of his article is that in his opinion, the idea of "new" anti-Semitism is merely a construction of the "old" anti-Semitism, with the inclusion of the notion of anti-Zionism being anti-Semitic. I further cannot find a reference in his editorial to the following claim, likewise presented in the summary: "''He suggests that line between legitimate and anti-Semitic criticism of Israel is being drawn by many supporters of Israel in such a way as to rule out any criticism beyond a rap across the Israeli government's knuckles or a finger wagging at the laws of its land.''" I should note that having read Klug's article, I am confused as to whether the "criticism" section is based exclusively on this work, or some of his other writings. For example, I have come across a paper by Klug on his site, Jewish Forum for Justice and Human Rights, which includes a related, but certainly different claim:<br/>-:''Second, there is another kind of overstatement, one that comes, as it were, from the opposite camp. Partisans of the Palestinians sometimes accuse partisans of Israel of using the word ‘antisemite’ as a deliberate tactic to shut them down. There is some truth in this claim; I myself have made the point. But it is far from being the whole truth. It treats the charge of antisemitism as if it were always a cynical ploy. This countercharge, however, is itself too cynical. When I speak of a mindset I am implying that many Jews believe, spontaneously and sincerely, that if you scratch an anti-Zionist you find an antisemite. Furthermore, sometimes it’s true.'' [http://www.jfjhr.org/stories/storyReader$28]<br/>-<br/>-As is clear, Klug is not contending that the usage of "'''new''' anti-Semitism" (which is what this Wikipedia article is about, after all) is to "silence debate", but usage of the general term "anti-Semite" is claimed by certain people (such as pro-Palestinians) to be misapplied by supporters of Israel and Jews. Guess what, not such a unique idea. Any perceived negative label can be misapplied, with an intent to malign or impugn: be it "fascist" or "communist", "racist" or "hippie". (See, for instance, [[Godwin's Law]]). In short, the statement "it is sometimes used to silence debate" does not have much relevance as to whether there is or isn't a contemporary phenomenon of "new anti-Semitism."--<font face="Verdana,San-Serif" size="-2"><strong>[[User:Leflyman|Leflyman]]<sup>[[User talk:Leflyman|Talk]]</sup></strong></font> 08:32, 29 June 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-*Good research.  I'm certain, however, that Norman Finkelstein ''does'' make this claim (ie. that the argument of "NAS" is sometimes used to silence debate).  I'll get back to you concerning a source.

But different views come together in different ways all the time; and it hardly makes them 'phenomena' on their own unless its outlined that way. To me the concept of New anti-Semitism is more descriptive of a political categorization by one party than something with actual objective purpose. ie, spin. Thats why its funny to me that the article mentions that New anti-Semites assume all Jews are crypto-Zionists, while in most cases that this term applies to most people are assumed to be crypto-anti-Semitic. Well, whatever, if people think that its in the debate enough to make a Wikipedia article worthy. It just highlights one of my concerns though--not that Wikipedia is necessarily agenda driven--but is consumed by a political discourse where different entities are created all the time for political reasons. Wikipedia is literally polluted with 'meta-descriptive' articles compared to the amount of primary historical or descriptive articles.

I also think some of the examples we give of attacks might count as OR, because it's not clear who's saying they are examples of new anti-Semitism, so they may have to go. I also have some books here that give a more nuanced view of what's going on, and it might be worth saying more about Yehuda Bauer's idea of a "fourth wave" of anti-Semitism.

This is not to say that there are no points of comparison, for there are - just as there are in a host of other countries where minority ethnic and national groups are oppressed. Nor is it even to say that the suffering experienced by Palestinians is less than that endured by "non-whites" in South Africa: it may or may not be (although I am not sure how to do the sums).

His general contention is that scholars and writers (such as historian Omer Bartov) are wrong to conflate anti-Semitism with anti-Zionism. Although, he counters his own argument (as SV noticed) by including claims that, ''"It is increasingly clear to observers in France, for example, that assaults on Jews in working-class suburbs of big cities are typically driven by frustration and anger at the government of Israel."''

Doing what, may I ask?  If you mean "denying the holocaust", he plainly is not.  There's nothing in the interview which suggests, even for a moment, that he is denying the reality or the extent of the holocaust.  (Finkelstein isn't far-right or far-left, btw.  I'm not really sure where he'd fall on the political spectrum.)<br/>-<br/>-::(ii)  The introduction is repugnant, of course, but Finkelstein had nothing to do with it and I doubt he was even aware of it prior to the broadcast.  The unfortunate reality is that these statements are fairly common in the mainstream Arab media, and that people who want to reach the Arab public are often forced to deal with hosts who hold such views.  Boycotting such media is one option.  Confronting it is another.  <br/>-<br/>-::NF chose the latter option.  Whether this was strategically wise is open for debate, but I believe that he chose the best possible follow-through for the "confrontation" approach.  ''He went on a prominent Lebanese television show and affirmed the reality of the holocaust''.  Westerners might miss the significance of this, but I think it took a certain amount of bravery.  (And doesn't it seem to you that the host looks uncomfortable in these moments, fidgeting with the papers and so forth?)<br/>-<br/>-::I maintain that Finkelstein cannot be held morally or causally responsible for the statements made by the host in the introduction.<br/>-<br/>-::(iii)  This interview is only one part of a much larger debate.  Norman Finkelstein has written an entire book criticizing (what he describes as) the misuse of memory of The Holocaust for political ends.  This does ''not'' mean that he questions the reality of the holocaust itself; both of his parents were holocaust survivors, and (if there's any doubt) he specifically affirms the reality and extent of the holocaust in ''Beyond Chutzpah''.  <br/>-<br/>-::He has given several interviews on this subject, in a variety of media outlets.  The entire question of a "Holocaust industry" probably deserves an article of its own -- mentioning it only with reference to this interview seems to be "poisoning the well" on a number of levels.

[[User:CJCurrie|CJCurrie]] 02:51, 5 July 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-:::This isn't the place to argue out the issues, but I have to disagree that NF "confronted" them. He didn't say a single thing that didn't fit 100 per cent into their world view, which is doubtless why they invited him on in the first place, and he's been around too long not to know they would use him. Please watch the clip. No sign of him being anything but 100 per cent in charge of the interview, and yet he said nothing to contradict them or give them pause for thought. Not one word. (Where did he "affirm the reality" of the Holocaust? Even the TV station admits that 50,000 might have died, attributing the figure outrageously to Raul Hilberg.) The host didn't look uncomfortable. She looked and sounded bored, because he was speaking so slowly and in such a wooden way, and kept repeating himself. How many times did he say "Nazi holocaust"?<br/>-<br/>-:::I do take your point about poisoning the well, and it's something I tried hard not to do as I was writing this. But there comes a point when someone has poisoned his own well, and it's not for us to ignore.

Victims, survivors, who cares. The Jews are lying again, that's all that matters. Do you think the Syrian TV interviewer understood more than a fraction of what David Duke was on about? What matters is the repetition of the choice phrases: Jews, in control, ethnocentrists, Jewish supremacists, dishonest, Nazis, no war for Israel.

For example, you write ''Proponents of the concept claim that "new" anti-Semtism is associated with certain [[Left-wing politics|left-wing political views]], and, in the context of the ongoing [[Arab-Israeli conflict]], represents a political union of Western [[humanism|humanists]] sympathetic to [[Palestinians]] under [[Israeli aparthied]]''.  This is, of course, completely false; proponents do not make this argument at all, since they do not consider those "New anti-Semites" to be "humanists", and they certainly don't agree that Palestinians live under "Israeli apartheid" (which, after all, is nothing more than an unfocussed epithet). As another example, you write ''particularly with regard to [[human rights]] abuses and [[war crime]]s by the U.S. and Israel.'', as if it were a fact that the U.S. and Israel are committing war crimes, and that allegations of "New anti-Semitism" are used to stifle debate about the U.S. On top of that, the writing was hard to decipher in places (particularly the opening sentence), and it was replete with spelling errors.

"Reliable sources" is disingenous because its a political theory, or claim, defined with a neologism.

Let's look at the examples. In the first, which is the best available in the [[Allegations of Israeli apartheid]] article, the actual article itself doesn't use the phrase "Israeli apartheid"; rather, the title of the article is "Israeli apartheid"; article titles are typically written by (in this case un-named) editors, not by authors.  The second qualifies the term 'apartheid' by putting it in inverted commas; clearly is it saying that this is not ''real'' apartheid.  The third doesn't even use the term "Israeli apartheid", and in any event simply repeats what pro-Palestinian activists on Oxford (and many other campuses) use as an epithet.  The fact that pro-Palestinian students activists claim that Israeli practices apartheid in no way legitimizes the claim as anything more than an epithet; in fact, the opposite. Almost every country is accused of "apartheid" these days; see [[Apartheid outside of South Africa]] for many examples. Nevertheless, it doesn't mean the term is used as anything more than an epithet - again, in fact, the opposite, and it is is a fundamental misunderstanding of [[WP:CIVIL]] to claim that describing an epithet as an epithet is un-civil.  On the other hand, New anti-Semitism is dealt with at length in many respectable sources, and it's hardly an epithet, since no-one calls people a "New anti-Semite".  The false conflation of the epithet "Israeli apartheid" with the concept of "New anti-Semitism" is a fundamentally flawed argument which does not square with the facts.

It can be difficult and frustrating dealing with SlimVirgin and Jayjg sometimes -- they can appear unreasonable to the inexperienced editor.  Although, from their perspective they probably feel the same way in the other direction.  The trick is to make use of formal dispute resolution mechanisms in Wikipedia when hitting brick walls.  I would suggest holding off a bit so that I can take part.  I have some major ideas on how to improve the article that may be fairly acceptable to all involved, but it would be best to introduce them when I have to deal to properly contribute.  Feel free to email me.  --[[User:Bhouston|Ben Houston]] 05:49, 29 July 2006 (UTC)<br/>-::In reality, the "trick" is to ensure that your edits conform strictly with Wikipedia's three fundamental content policies, [[WP:NOR]], [[WP:NPOV]], and [[WP:V]], with the latter's corollary guideline [[WP:RS]]. Once people start doing that, content disputes tend to melt away. Unfortunately, people tend to get offended by the content itself, feeling they must fight it, and end up ignoring the content rules, and [[WP:NOT]], rather than working within them.

We are an encyclopedia which is never faster at reporting particular bits of information than news media is, but we are always faster at reporting things as a whole picture. (That is why of course people favor inclusion and are repulsed by deletion/exclusion --because people can always read from among claims, and make a choice between them.<br/>-<br/>-: The real problem with this article is that it is ultimately talking about a [[fear]] of persecution --not ''persecution'' itself, but the fear thereof. Sympathy or insympathy to that fear is simply POV, but given the context of past persecutions its a natural fact of any related discussion. (BTW do we have an article on the "fear of anti-Semitism"?) Referring to these piecemeal points as a "concept" is one way to deal with and represent this meme as a topic, rather than simply make it an NPOV article about the fearful or alarmist claims of certain authors. As Ive said before, its not bad, though I of course would like the criticism to be featured and explained more in the lede. The criticism in fact does the concept more justice than the claims itself do, because it tends to make the intelligent distinction between the concepts of nationhood and statehood. Proponents try to mix these together and this only invites more.. criticism. -[[User:Stevertigo|Ste]]|[[User_talk:Stevertigo|vertigo]] 17:19, 29 July 2006 (UTC)<br/>-::No, the real problem with this article is that opponents of the concept keep trying to make up arguments against its validity, and using the Talk: page for that purpose as well, rather than simply quoting what [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] have to say on the matter.

However, to put it bluntly, some certain editors here have a huge amount of clout and can get away with pushing their pro-"anti-Semitism accusing" POV. See for example also the [[Anti-globalization and Anti-Semitism]] article, which only got created in the first place because a sheriff badge in a demonstration was mistaken for a Star of David despite the word "sheriff" being written on it. After this fact was finally accepted (begrudgingly by some), the article however still exists. I'm taking an educated guess here and conjecture that if some person did were to move this page to "Allegations of new Anti-Semitism" or something similar, he/she would probably get burned with the accusation of "disrupting Wikipedia to make a point", after which, at worst, the Official Kangaroo Court may possibly come in full session or, at best, it would "merely" continue to haunt the editor in question in perpetuity.<br> '''''The nice thing about policies is that there are so many of them to choose from.''''' -- [[User:Dissident|Dissident]] ([[User talk:Dissident|Talk]]) 13:51, 29 July 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-::I would avoid personal attacks since it serves to reduce one's ability to influence the situation -- it is a downward spiral that one must avoid.  I think that patience and appropriate use of Wikipedia dispute resolution processes can achieve a lot more than one thicks.  The trick is to not take anyone's word or opinion too seriously even when others are appearing to act "authoratively".  --[[User:Bhouston|Ben Houston]] 14:59, 29 July 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-It's actually worse than "Israeli apartheid", because every time one mentions "new anti-Semitism", either in the title of the article or in its contents, at best, it is not clear whether one talks about something that is new and anti-Semitic (itself a historical misnomer) or about the infamous concept of which it is the neologism. while at worst, the two are implicitly assumed to be equivalent. Of course, that was the whole reason why the name was chosen in the first place: for propaganda purposes. One solution would be to split the article up (e.g. by making "new anti-Semitism" a disambiguation page to "contemporary anti-Semitism" and "new anti-Semitism (term)" or something like that). Until then, at the very least a NPOV notice should be put here, for which I believe there is sufficient support. -- [[User:Dissident|Dissident]] ([[User talk:Dissident|Talk]]) 18:48, 29 July 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-:I agree that it has a confusing name.  Slow and steady push for change through the appropriate channels is the best way, otherwise you risk allowins others to protray you as disruptive and thus delegitimize you.  It works both ways though, one just has to learn how the system works.  I think another decent title is one like "Theory of New Anti-Semitism" -- Jayjg made a similar suggestion recently here [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAllegations_of_tourist_apartheid_in_Cuba&diff=63473832&oldid=63470176].  I think, as a responded to Jayjg's comment, that the prefix "Theory of" is most useful in the context as a differentiator when there exists the possibility of confusion to the read.  I think that the trick to making effective change is to ensure that one clearly acknowledges the incidences that the theory tries to link together into a coherent theory, and just focus on dealing with the degree to which the theory fits and the flaws and potential for misuse that critics point to -- this prevents the conflict from being about whether anti-Semitic events are happening but just about the interpretation and linking of them.  I would even have a section that describes the evidence that is separate NPOV section from the explanation of the theory -- this makes criticism of the theory by Wikipedia editors less likely to be precieved as hostile attempts to diminish real and percieved anti-Semitism.  These are just ideas, but can you see where I am coming from here?  --[[User:Bhouston|Ben Houston]] 19:13, 29 July 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-::I think it would be better to move this to [[leftist anti-Semitism]] (whose existence like "Israeli apartheid" can be debatted without doublespeak), after which it can be merged with [[Anti-globalization and Anti-Semitism]], whose title is [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions#Use of .22and.22|a violation of policy]] anyway. -- [[User:Dissident|Dissident]] ([[User talk:Dissident|Talk]]) 19:42, 29 July 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-Actually, this article is about New anti-Semitism, and it really needs to stay at the name which [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] use to describe it; "New anti-Semitism".

No one, to my knowledge, who supports the theory of New Anti-Semitism has said either that the viewpoint itself is inherently leftist nor that all of its adherents are leftists. Insofar as the phenomenon they are describing includes anti-Semitism expressed as anti-Zionism, clearly that occurs at times in the Arab world, expressed by people who have little or nothing in common with any "left".<br/>-:I, for one, would not be opposed to a title that indicated more clearly that this is a "theory" or "allegation".

But if you actually read the transcript, you realize that this is not what he says. Here is the quote together with its context: "I know that to some of you in this audience, and in the Jewish community at large, it has sometimes ''seemed'' as if the United Nations serves all the world's peoples but one: the Jews. The exclusion of Israel from the system of regional groupings; the intense focus given to some of Israel's actions, while other situations sometimes fail to elicit the similar outrage; these and other circumstances have given ''a regrettable impression of bias and one-sidedness''." You, on the other hand, have not given your reason for reinserting the disputed sentence. Thus, '''please explain to me why you think the current phrasing of the quotation is justified'''; otherwise your edit is completely inappropriate. In case of no reply, I will revert your change. PJ 06:21, 3 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-::Actually your removal of the passage was completly inappropriate.

I made my case, I stated my intention, and only after I had given people time to comment did I remove the disputed sentence. Now, regarding the issue at hand, please read what Annan is actually saying. He says that it "to some of you in this audience...it sometimes seems as if the United Nations serves all the world's peoples but one". Annan is not saying that it de facto is like this, or that he believes it, only that it to some people seems as if it were the case. He is further saying that it has given an "impression of bias..." Here again, an impression does not need to correspond to anything in real; an impression simply means that it seems that way. Hence, you cannot draw the conclusion that Annan believes that the UN has been unfair to the Jews. That would not only be bad reasoning but would also presuppose that those words was not intended to have any meaning. This would further be to disregards the fact that Annan is known for his subtle and diplomatic way of speaking. Either way, we cannot include ambiguous sentences based on a particular interpretation of it; that would constitute original research. Remember, you have the burden of proof here, since you are advocating that the sentence be included. You are the one claiming that your interpretation should take precedence over mine, without backing it up with any substantial arguments. PJ 13:48, 3 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-::::Actually the you are the one that is arguing based on your own interpretation of it, you have basically decided that he isn't saying what he is actually saying based on a few inconsequential remarks that you somewhat have oddly announced indicate that he doesn't believe what he is saying. The only thing I am saying is that we should include the quote into the article since it is obviously both relevant and properly referenced. Your claim that I have to "prove" something before I can insert a sourced statement into an appropriate article is strange and has no basis in policy.- [[User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg|Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg]] | [[User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg|Talk]] 16:18, 3 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-:::::As long as you understand the meaning of "seems as if [to some]" and "gives the impression", there is nothing odd about what I say. Perhaps you do not grasp the meaning of these words, because you have to do violence on our language and logic in order to interpret the disputed sentence in your favour. Furthermore, simply having a reference to a newspaper does not automatically qualify what-have-you to be part of this article. You need to show that the material is relevant and that the source is trustworthy; I am sure you are aware of this, if you give it some thought. Most importantly, you have to make sure that the source is not misrepresenting that material which it intends to present. I have provided you with the transcript of Annan's speech, taken from the UN website. And by comparing the transcript and the quotation in the newspaper article, it is clear that the newspaper article has misrepresented Annan's statement by only including a particular clause and leaving out the rest. Your claim that Annan was inconsequential but that we nevertheless can dicern his true intention behind the statement, is based on a vulgar assumption. The fact is, the complete statement (as it is found in the transcript) is at best very ambiguous and cannot be used to make the point some wish to make. (If you disagree with this, let us include the the entire paragraph, or at least the entire sentence. That would be fine with me.) Thus, unless you address the real issues over the disputed sentence, I find it unfruitful to continue discussing this matter with you. Instead, I would call upon others to voice their opinion regarding this issue, and if necessary request an arbiter.

As I understand the paragraph in the Wikipedia entry in which the sentence in question appears, the purpose is to lend credibility to the idea that new antisemitism does exists. Thus, given the context, Annan's statement may appear to be a "de jure" acknowledgement (i.e. saying something about the legitimacy of such belief) not simply a "de facto" acknowledgement. But as I see it, Annan is not saying anything about the legitimacy of the belief that the UN is being biased against the Jews. As a consequence, the utility of including the sentence at all seems dubious to me. I don't mind the inclusion of Annan's statement as such, but I do worry about the connotations being bestowed upon it given the context.

He seems to me to be talking about anti-Semitism in general:<br/>-<br/>-:"[[Michael Neumann]], a professor of [[philosophy]] at [[Trent University]], is critical of how the term [[anti-Semitism]] is used, and says that too often criticism of [[Israel]] is wrongly labeled anti-Semitic. (Neumann, Michael. [http://www.CounterPunch.org/neumann12302003.html There Are Much Larger Threats: Criticism of Israel is ''not'' Anti-Semitism], ''[[CounterPunch (newsletter)|CounterPunch]]'', December 30, 2003. Accessed 9 January 2006) He argues that anti-Semitism should be defined as hatred of Jews for what they are and not for what they do. Thus criticizing Jews for simply being Jews or applying anti-Semitic stereotypes to them would be anti-Semitic but not, say, criticizing the Jewish community for failing to hold [[Israel]] accountable for its actions. He argues that anti-Semitism also applies to the attitudes that propaganda tries to instill. Though not always explicitly racist, it involves racist motives and the intention to do real damage. Reasonably well-founded opposition to Israeli policies, even if that opposition hurts all Jews, does not fit this description. Neither does simple, harmless dislike of things Jewish.

I only ask because little of the material you copied in there actually deals with the concept of New anti-Semitism, but instead is nit-picking about minor writing and copyediting errors that frankly makes Finkelstein (and his arguments) look worse. Can you explain the relevance of the number of Jews from Arab lands who immigrated to Israel, or Aung San Suu Kyi's religion, to the validity of the concept of New anti-Semitism?

On the surface this seems a bit specious, but given the fact that Chesler's book was a popular work, talked directly about the subject at hand, and no doubt had some catalytic effect in shaping the debate, it requires some mentioning here.

Her book may be of some interest, so I'm not running it down entirely, but as I said, it is a polemic, not a scholarly study or scholarly opinion.

Cf. John Ashcroft's "Fuck the Jews" comment.<br/>-<br/>-- That left wingers who make anti-Zionist polemics are motivated by anti-Semitism is a subjective unverifiable opinion in the vast majority of cases.

Please distinguish between ideas, concepts and words, and the issues they claim to point to. You are entitled to say: "You are pointing to nothing."

[[User:SlimVirgin|SlimVirgin]] <sup><font color="Purple">[[User_talk:SlimVirgin|(talk)]]</font></sup> 19:35, 22 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-::This problematic sentence is this one: ''"Because it is a new concept, academics and other researchers are working to identify instances of it and are attempting to formulate a precise description."''<br/>-::I have no problem with this part: ''"academics and other researchers are working to identify instances of it"'' -- that is simply NPOV and descriptive.<br/>-::The problematic part is later part: ''"are attempting to formulate a precise description."''  This phrase, in its reference to "a precise description", implies that there is a pending '''singular''' precise description.  The serious study of "new anti-Semitism", while related to many fields, is really just sub-field of [[sociology]].  Sociology, unlike mathematics, physics, most fields of biology and other hard sciences, tend not to develop singular precise definitions of concepts unless there is only one researcher or coordinated team involved.  Instead, multiple interested researchers propose descriptions that are precise within their theoretical frameworks.  As time goes by, some definitions may become more accepted than others but even so they are notoriously for imprecision and gray areas.  Even in diagnostic psychology the formal definitions of most mental illness (the ones not yet connected to a distinct underlying biological basis) are not precise but rather a lists of symptoms/attributes - the more of which displayed indicate highly likelihood of having that illness.  These definitions themselves are refined ever few years as well, thus they are not an end state either but rather the best general consensus at the time.  (Also these standard definitions are the result of a well defined process of collectively updating a standard manual under guidance of a major body.  As far as I can tell no similar thing is happening in this field thus to say there is here a drive towards a singular precise description seems to be just wishful thinking.)  Thus from my reading, this sentence is a mischaracterization of what is going on -- there currently are a number of similar but distinct (competing?) descriptions -- but to frame it as a drive towards a singular '''precise''' description, or even just a singular description, is just OR.<br/>-::The start of the sentence, '''"Because it is a new concept"'', is not really relevant to the non-problematic part (there is no need to justify why people might be looking for more instances.)  But when read with the problematic later part it comes across as apologetic -- that the lack of a precise definition is excusable because it is a new concept.   But the presumption that there is a singular precise definition pending is based on a misunderstanding of how things in this area of study work as I explained earlier.  It is for this reason the apology reads as if it is OR added by a proponent, albeit an unsophisticated one.  <br/>-::Thus the sentence, except for the middle phrase which is descriptive, reads as nonsensical OR based on misunderstandings and wishful thinking combined with some apologetics from the point of view of an unsophisticated proponent.

The poster is clearly anti zionist because it specifically mentions Israel, war, and "Zionist pigs" and it was being displayed at an anti-war rally.  It is my sense that people can be strongly anti-war, as an extension anti-Zionist because they don't like the way Israel is asserting and defending its sovereignty, and not anti-semetic.  I would have thought, notwithstanding the clarification now afforded in the caption, an image in that key prominent position that more clearly is not potentially anti Zionist , might get the article's viewpoint accross better - particularly given the current events in Lebanon.  The top image could be used elsewhere in the article and .  I would have thought the anti-semetic graffiti in the cemetery in France is a better lead illustration with no ambiguity about motives and suitably repulsive. I endorse Gimmetrow's comments and support the stance adopted by Netscott that the caption should be clear.  As an outsider to this topic, I find it a little weird that the current events in Lebanon and reactions to them are not mentioned though I note that this poster dates from several years ago.--[[User:AYArktos|Arktos]] <sup>[[User_talk:AYArktos|talk]]</sup> 21:47, 24 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-:::What on earth would Lebanon have to do with this?

Is there a white supremacist neo-Nazi on the board of the [[Farm Animal Welfare Council]]? Is there a letter from any group to David Duke saying they appreciate his support of their cause? Those sorts of evidence would tend to provide substance to the claims that there is a link. Right now, these statements are like saying that because [[Yigal Amir]] opposed the [[Oslo Accords]], all those who oppose the Oslo Accords are violent assassins. Duke is a neo-Nazi loony trying to get a shred of legitimacy by linking himself to an otherwise-legitimate effort by animal rights activists. We have no evidence to suggest otherwise, so at this point the whole section is [[guilt by association]]. Either we include the balancing reliably sourced statements by animal rights groups which explain why they believe shechita bans are necessary (none of these groups make any claims other than that the practice is cruel), and include the fact that many Jews believe that the practice should be made more humane - or we remove the whole thing as fundamentally unbalanced. We could, instead, provide a link to the [[Shechita]] page, where the claims and counter-claims are more thoroughly discussed.

I would like Wikipedia to be a thorough and reasonable encyclopedia. While I think a lot of good work is done by you and others on this article, I also think that the problem posed by it is a generic problem on wikipedia. It IS a soap box. You can use it to promote your views in subtle ways. The problem with this article is that it is very hard to get opposing views from the vast majority of researchers (including myself) that do not believe that talking about a "new anti-semitism" as a phenomenon as such. Especially this alledged anti-semitism on the left in europe. The reason that it is hard to quote is that the phenomenon/wave etc is not an issue that others than its proponents really talk or write that much about. Who writes articles about a concept that they think is not very precise? Do not misunderstand. I believe that there may be an increase in antisemitism in Europe and elsewhere. But the "phenomenon" as described here, is a vague cathegory mainly used by people with a strong political motivation for it. I feel they use wikipedia to try to breath some life into the concept. I see you are an experienced wikipedian, so I suppose you share my wish for a solid encyclopedia, and you have the right to take offense to us drive-by shooters, but still I must express my concerns about this article.

Maybe, just maybe, a professor in a good university who has been studying European history or anti-Semitism ''all his adult life'' knows more about it than you.

[49] [[User:Myung1|Myung1]] 20:24, 25 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-::The article is linked, and your [[WP:AGF|bad faith]] regarding the inclusion of this material is astonishing, and you have violated [[WP:3RR]]. [[User:Jayjg|Jayjg ]]<sup><small><font color="DarkGreen">[[User_talk:Jayjg|(talk)]]</font></small></sup> 20:54, 25 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-Jayjg, you exhibity the bad faith but cannot see it I guess, and you should assume good faith in others.  Chomsky and Buchanan are not in any Red/Brown axis.  That's all I'm saying.  There is no link to verify what Schoenfeld actually stated either, or you would produce it.  To highlight this supposed axis, not linked or verified, is bad faith from Shoenfeld, and you support that for some reason, that's quite telling. I have not violated 3RR.[[User:Myung1|Myung1]] 21:05, 25 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-:Myung, you're being disruptive. We don't need to know what you think about Chomsky and Buchanan. We need only know what the source says. That's what "verified" means. Have you edited Wikipedia before with another user name or as an anon? [[User:SlimVirgin|SlimVirgin]] <sup><font color="Purple">[[User_talk:SlimVirgin|(talk)]]</font></sup> 21:15, 25 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-::Now Slim, why would you ask that? Just because he moves around and edits with greater ease than ol me who has been in here only since Dec. and has less than 2,000 edits? :) --[[User:Threeafterthree|Tom]] 21:18, 25 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-:::Yes, sorry, I don't know what came over me. :-) [[User:SlimVirgin|SlimVirgin]] <sup><font color="Purple">[[User_talk:SlimVirgin|(talk)]]</font></sup> 21:20, 25 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-::::It's not what "I think" it's about truth and accuracy and building a good encyclopedia, and not providing a soap-box for [[propaganda]] and [[conspriacy theories]].  You cannot provide any back-up nor a link, to substantiate that one particular non-mainstream author's opinion, which is also patently false, otherwise you could provide just one other source to verify it, but you cannot.  It's hard to assume good faith when you're surrounded by everything else but.  How many more false comments can this article link to, and call them verifiable and reliable?  I see how it works now.  See you round the campus!!  [[User:Myung1|Myung1]] 21:37, 25 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+#REDIRECT [[Rake]]{{R to disambiguation page}}</td>
