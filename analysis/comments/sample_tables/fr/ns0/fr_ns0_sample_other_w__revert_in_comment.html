For more images of the 747 see list at bottom of page]]<br/>+A '''mercenary''' is a [[soldier]] who fights for [[money]], regardless of ideological, national or political considerations.  When addressed to a professional [[soldier]] in a regular national army, the term is normally used as an insult or epithet.<br/> <br/>-The '''[[Boeing]] 747''', also popularly known as the '''jumbo jet''', is the second largest passenger [[airliner]] after [[Airbus A380]], but it remains the largest [[aircraft]] in commercial service. The four-engine 747, produced by [[Boeing Commercial Airplanes]], combines passenger-carrying capacities of up to 550 people with its unique [[double decker|two-deck]] configuration (the small upper deck is usually used for business-class passengers).  A typical mixed-class layout would accommodate about 380 passengers.   The 747 flies at high-subsonic speeds (typically 0.85 Mach or 565 [[mph]] or 909 [[km/h]]) and features intercontinental range (8,430 statute miles, or 13,570 km, for the 747-400 version), in some configurations sufficient to fly New York-Hong Kong (roughly a third of the globe) non-stop.  By [http://active.boeing.com/commercial/orders/displaystandardreport.cfm?cboCurrentModel=747&optReportType=AllModels&cboAllModel=747&ViewReportF=View+Report  May 2004], a total of 1381 aircraft have been built or ordered in various 747 configurations.<br/>+== Mercenaries and the Laws of War ==<br/> <br/>-==Historical Background==<br/>+See also [[laws_of_war|Laws of War]].<br/> <br/>-The 747 was born out of the explosion of the popularity of air travel in the [[1960]]s.  The enormous popularity of the [[Boeing 707]] had revolutionised long distance travel in the world, and had began the concept of the "global village" made possible by jet revolution.  Boeing had already developed a study for a very large airplane when it was bidding on a US military contract for a huge airlifter.  Boeing lost the contract to [[Lockheed]], but came under pressure from its most loyal airline customer [[Pan Am]] to develop a giant passenger plane which would be over twice the size of the 707.  In [[1966]], Boeing had proposed a preliminary configuration for the giant airliner, which was to be called the 747, and Pan Am got the ball rolling with an order for 25 of the initial -100 series.  Boeing took the shrewd move and designed the 747 so that it could easily be adapted to a freighter, knowing that when sales of the passenger version dried up, then the aircraft could remain in production.  The cockpit was moved to an upper deck so that a nose cone loading door could be included, thus creating the 747's distinctive "bulge", which was initially used as a luxurious first-class lounge/bar area, but as time went on was used for extra seating capacity.<br/>+In the '''Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions'''(GC) of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts '''(Protocol I), 8 June 1977''' it is stated:<br/> <br/>-The development of the 747 was a huge undertaking.  Boeing didn't have a factory big enough to assemble the giant aircraft, so had to build an all-new assembly building near [[Everett, Washington]].  [[Pratt and Whitney]] developed a massive [[high-bypass turbofan engine]], the [[JT9D]] that was, in the beginning, exclusively for the 747. In order to appease concerns about the safety and flyability of such a massive aircraft, the 747 was designed with no less than four backup [[hydraulic]] systems, split control surfaces, multiple structural redundancy, and sophisticated flaps which allow it to use standard-length runways.  <br/>+''Art 47. Mercenaries<br/> <br/>-Boeing had promised the 747 to Pan Am by [[1970]], so it had less than four years to develop, build and test the 747.  Work progressed at such a breakneck pace that all those who worked on the development of the 747 were given the nickname "The Incredibles".  The massive cost of developing the 747 and building the Everett factory meant that Boeing had gambled its very existence on the 747's success, and very nearly bankrupted the company in the early [[1970s]].  The gamble paid off however, and Boeing enjoyed a monopoly on very large passenger transports that has only been broken 35-years later with the advent of the [[Airbus A380]].<br/>+:''A mercenary is any person who:<br/>+::''(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;is specially recruited locally or abroad in order to fight in an armed conflict;<br/>+::''(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;does, in fact, take a direct part in the hostilities;<br/>+::''(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;is motivated to take part in the hostilities essentially by the desire for private gain and, in fact, is promised, by or on behalf of a Party to the conflict, material compensation substantially in excess of that promised or paid to combatants of similar ranks and functions in the armed forces of that Party;<br/>+::''(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;is neither a national of a Party to the conflict nor a resident of territory controlled by a Party to the conflict;<br/>+::''(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;is not a member of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict; and<br/>+::''(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;has not been sent by a State which is not a Party to the conflict on official duty as a member of its armed forces.<br/> <br/>-The fact that Boeing had to "bet the farm", and came through with a revolutionary product is often contrasted with [[Airbus]], which is given risk free loans for their developement projects.<br/>+It should be noted that as many countries including the U.S. are not signatory to the ''Protocol Additional GC 1977''(APGC77). So APGC77 art 47 can best be seen as a guide to what a mercenary is. However without an agreed international definition it is the best around.<br/> <br/>-==Variants==<br/>+Under [[Third_Geneva_Convention| GC III]] if a soldier is captured by an enemy, he must be treated as a [[lawful combatant]] and therefore a ''Protected Person'' which for a soldier is as a Prisoner of War (POW) until the soldier has faced a '''competent tribunal''' (GC III Art 5). That tribunal may decide that the person is a mercenary using criteria in APGC77 or some domestic law equivalent. At that point the mercenary becomes an [[unlawful combatant]] but they must still be "''treated with humanity and, in case of trial, shall not be deprived of the rights of fair and regular trial''", because they are still covered by [[Fourth Geneva Convention|GC IV]] Art 5.  The only exception to GC IV Art 5 is if they a national of the  authority which is holding them but in which case they would not be a mercenary under APGC77 Art 47.d.<br/> <br/>-===747-100===<br/>+If after a regular trial, a captured soldier is found to be a mercenary, then they can  expect to be treated as common criminals and may face execution. As they are not POWs they can not expect repatriation at the end of the war. The best known, post World War II, example of this was on [[June 28]] [[1976]] an Angolan court sentenced four mercenaries to death and nine others to prison terms ranging from 16 to 30 years. The three Britons and an American were shot by a firing squad on [[July 10]] [[1976]].<br/> <br/>-The first edition of the jet, the 747-100, rolled out of the new Everett facility  on [[2 September]] [[1969]]. This factory is the largest building ever built. The 747-100 entered service in [[1970]] with launch customer [[Pan American World Airways]].  It was later replaced by the '''747-100B''', a very similar aircraft with a stronger airframe and [[undercarriage]] design.  Another -100 variant, the '''747-100SR''', has a capacity of up to 550 passengers and is used on domestic flights in [[Japan]].  The basic -100 has a range of about 4,500 miles with full load.<br/>+The legal status of civilian contractors depends upon the nature of their work and their nationality in respect of the combatants.  But if they have not ''in fact, taken a direct part in the hostilities'' (APGC77 Art 47.b) they are not mercenaries and are entitled to the protection of the Geneva Conventions.  <br/> <br/>-747-100 aircraft can usually be distinguished by the upper deck, which normally has only three windows.  There are exceptions.  Also, some airlines purchased "SUD," or "stretched upper deck" modifications, which make the upper deck almost identical to a 747-300. <br/>+The situation during [[2003 Occupation of Iraq|Occupation of Iraq 2003 &ndash;]] shows how difficult it is to define what a  mercenary is. While the United States governed the country any U.S. citizen who worked as a armed guard could not be called a mercenary because they were ''a national of a Party to the conflict'' (APGC77 Art 47.d). With the handover of power to the interim Iraqi government it could be argued that unless they declare that they are a resident in Iraq ie ''a resident of territory controlled by a Party to the conflict'' (APGC77 Art 47.d), they are now mercenaries. It should be noted that Coalition soldiers in Iraq which are supporting the interim Iraqi government are not mercenaries, because either they are  part of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict or they have been ''sent by a State which is not a Party to the conflict on official duty as a member of its armed forces'' (APGC77 Art 47.f).<br/> <br/>-===747-200===<br/>+See also [[privateer]], [[Letter of marque]], [[private military contractor]]<br/> <br/>-Introduced in [[1971]], and further improved over successive years,  the 747-200 has higher thrust and weight-lifting capability than the 747-100,  flying farther.  It can usually be distinguished by its eight-window upper deck (but, again, some airlines have given their -200 aircraft SUD, and a few early -200's had just 3 windows).  The last models of the -200, built in the late 1980's, have a full load range of about 6,700 miles.<br/>+=== Gurkhas and French Foreign Legionnaires are not mercenaries ===<br/> <br/>-The 747-200C and -200F variants were designed to carry air freight.  The '''747-200F''' is a pure freighter, the '''747-200C''' is a "convertible" aircraft that can carry either passengers or freight.  A sub-variant is unofficially called the '''747-200M''' and is a "combi" aircraft that can carry both at the same time.  Like the -100, many -200's have been given a new lease of life by being converted into freight aircraft, rather than being scrapped.<br/>+The two best known units in which nationals of a country serve in another nation's armed forces are the British [[Brigade of Gurkhas]] and the [[French Foreign Legion]]. Soldiers who serve in these two elite units are not mercenaries.<br/> <br/>-===747SP===<br/>+British Gurkhas are fully integrated soldiers of the [[British Army]]. They operate in formed units of the Brigade of Gurkhas and abide by the rules and regulations under which all British soldiers serve,[http://www.army.mod.uk/brigade_of_gurkhas/gurkha_employment/tacos/index.htm](''Similar rules apply for Gurkhas serving in [[Indian Army]])''. French Foreign Legionnaires are in formed units of the [[French Foreign Legion]] which is deployed and fights as an organized unit of the [[French Army]]. This means that as member of the armed forces of Britain or France then under APGC77 Art 47.e and APGC77 Art 47.f they can not be mercenaries.<br/> <br/>-The 747SP, or "Special Performance," was first delivered in [[1976]].  The SP was largely a stop-gap model to compete with the [[DC-10|Douglas DC-10]] and [[Lockheed Tristar|Lockheed L-1011 TriStar]].  The 747 was simply too big for many routes, and Boeing didn't have a mid-sized widebody to compete in the segment of the market that the DC-10 and TriStar had created.  Crippled by the huge costs it had incurred in developing both the 737 and 747 in the late [[1960]]s, Boeing could not afford to develop an all-new design, so instead it shortened the 747 and reoptimised it for speed and range at the expense of capacity.  The SP could only accommodate 220 passengers in a 3-class cabin, but could fly over 6,500 miles at speeds of up to 610 [[mph]].  Some airline insiders call it the "74 Short" or "Baby Jumbo" because of its shortened fuselage, and stubby appearance.<br/>+=== Mercenaries and domestic law ===<br/> <br/>-The 747SP was the longest-flying airliner available until the [[Airbus A340]], and found its way into the fleets of [[American Airlines]], [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]], and [[Qantas]], airlines that needed its range for trans-South Pacific routes. (American later used its 747SP's for services to [[Tokyo]].)  <br/>+Some countries try to stop their citizens fighting in conflicts unless they are under the control of their own armed forces. For example under United States law (the &quot;Neutrality Act&quot;), an American citizen who participates in an armed conflict to which the United States is neutral may be subject to criminal penalties.<br/> <br/>-For all its technical achievements, the SP never sold as well as Boeing hoped, only 44 were ever built and most that are still in service are used by operators in the [[Middle East]] and [[Africa]].<br/>+== Mercenary Operations ==<br/> <br/>-===747-300===<br/>+It is known that mercenaries have been hired to fight in the conflicts in former Yugoslavia.  Many of these were ex-Eastern Bloc soldiers who had no employment opportunities after the fall of the Soviet Union.<br/> <br/>-The 747-300 was introduced in [[1980]], and was the first 747 model to feature a "stretched upper deck," which increased its capacity over earlier models.  Combi ('''747-300M''') and Japanese domestic ('''747-300SR''') models were also built.  The upper deck was now accessed via a straight staircase, rather than the spiral steps that featured in the -100 and -200.<br/>+The largest mercenary outfit engaged in actual warfare, [[Executive Outcomes]], consists largely of former members of the then white-dominated South African military. EO operates in battalion strength with organic helicopter gunship support.  Corporations such as this are known as [[private military company|private military companies]], and tend to be frowned upon by the [[United Nations]] (even so, the UN hired Executive Outcomes to do some logistic support in Africa).  Nevertheless, some people suggest that PMCs may be useful in combatting [[genocide]]s and slaughters in situations where the UN is unwilling or unable to intervene.<br/> <br/>-===747-400===<br/>+It could be argued that [[paramilitary]] forces under private control are functionally mercenaries instead of [[security guard]]s.  However, national governments reserve the right to strictly regulate the number, nature and armaments of such private forces.<br/> <br/>-The 747-400 is the latest model of the 747, and also the only series still in production. It added [[winglet]]s, an all-new [[glass cockpit]] which dispensed with the need for a flight engineer, tail fuel tanks, revised engines, an all-new interior, and newer in-flight entertainment to the basic design of the -300 series.  It first entered service in [[1989]] with Northwest Airlines.<br/>+== Mercenaries in Africa ==<br/> <br/>-The -400 is available in combi ('''747-400M''') and freighter ('''747-400F''') variants.  The Japanese domestic variant, the '''747-400D''', is the highest-capacity passenger aircraft in the world, capable of carrying 568 passengers.  <br/>+In the 20th century, mercenaries have been mostly involved in conflicts on the continent of Africa.  There have been a number of unsavory incidents in the brushfire wars of Africa, some involving recruitment of naive European and American men "looking for adventure" and thrusting them into combat situations where they would not survive to get paid.<br/> <br/>-The '''747-400ER''' is 400's extended range version: it also comes in an all-freight version, the '''747-400ERF'''.<br/>-Plans to develop a new model, the '''747-400XQLR''', which stood for Extra Quiet Long-Range, were shelved.<br/>+Many of the adventurers in Africa who have been described as mercenaries were in fact ideologically motivated to support particular governments, and would not fight "for the highest bidder."<br/> <br/>-As yet unnamed, Boeing will convert four passenger 747-400 aircraft into an outsize configuration, in order to ferry [[Boeing 7E7|7E7]] parts to [[Everett, Washington|Everett]], [[Washington]] for final assembly.<br/>+Particularly notorious mercenaries include [[Mike Hoare]] and [[Bob Denard]]:<br/>+* '''Mike Hoare''' was involved in the [[Congo War]] in the early 1960s and a [[Seychelles]] failed [[coup]] in 1978.<br/>+* '''Bob Denard''' was involved in numerous African campaigns in many countries often with the covert support of France. However his particular speciality was intervening in the [[Comoros]]. The last time was in [[1995]], when he staged a coup which failed, thanks to French Government intervention.<br/> <br/>-===747 Advanced===<br/>+Mercenaries fought for the Biafrans in the 4th Commando Brigade during the [[Nigerian Civil War]], (1967&ndash;1970). Other mercenaries flew aircraft for the Biafrans. In October 1966, for example, a Royal Air Burundi DC-4M Argonaut, flown by a mercenary Heinrich Wartski also known Henry Wharton, crashlanded in Cameroun with military supplies destined for Biafra.<br/> <br/>-Boeing is now working with airlines  to create a new 747 which will use same engine and cockpit technology as the [[Boeing 7E7|7E7]] . The new [[Boeing 747 Advanced|747]] will be quieter, more economical and environmentally friendly. It will be capable of carrying up to 500 passengers in a 3-class configuration and fly over 8,000-nautical-miles ( 14,816 km) at .86 Mach.<br/>+In the middle [[1970s]] John Banks a Briton recruited mercenaries to fight for the ''National Front for the Liberation of Angola'' [[FNLA]] against the ''Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola'' ([[MPLA]]) in the civil war that broke out when Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975.  When captured John Derek Barker's role as a leader of mercenaries in Northern Angola led the judges to send him to face the firing squad. 3 others were executed and 9 imprisoned.<br/> <br/>-===Government and military models===<br/>+American Bob MacKenzie, was killed in the [[Malal Hills]] in February [[1995]] while commanding Gurkha Security Guards (GSG) in [[Sierra Leone]].<br/> <br/>-The current [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidential]] aircraft, [[VC-25A]], is among the most famous 747 models. It is popularly known as ''[[Air Force One]]'', even though that name refers to any [[United States Air Force]] aircraft carrying the President. VC-25A is based on the civilian Boeing 747-200. Other special 747s include the [[E-4B]] airborne emergency command and control post, modified 747s to transport the [[Space Shuttle]] ([[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]]), and [[aerial refueling]] [[tanker]]s.  A recent addition to the military's 747 arsenal is the experimental [[Airborne Laser]], a component of the [[National Missile Defense]] plan.<br/>+A fictional portrait of mercenary operations in the 1970s is [[Frederick Forsyth]]'s book, ''[[The Dogs of War]]'' was set on the island of Malabo which was renamed Zangoro and given  an uranium deposit. Since the discovery of oil there in the mid 1990s, it does not need a fictional uranium deposit for it to be of interest to financiers and mercenaries. In August 2004 there was the a plot to overthrow the government of [[Malabo]]. Currently eight South African [[apartheid]]-era special forces (the leader of whom is Nick du Toit), six Armenian aircrew and five local men are in Black Beach prison on the island. They are accused of being an advanced guard for a coup to place Severo Moto in power. It was planned, it is alleged, by Simon Mann a former SAS officer. It is alleged that there is a paper trail from him which implicates Sir Mark Thatcher, Lord Archer and Ely Calil (a Lebanese-born oil trader).<br/> <br/>-A number of other governments also use the 747 as a VIP transport, including [[Bahrain]], [[Iran]], [[Japan]], [[Oman]], [[Qatar]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Taiwan]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]].<br/>+== Mercenaries in European History ==<br/> <br/>-==Powerplants==<br/>-(For the last versions of each series offered)<br/>-*'''747-100'''<br/>-**four [[Pratt & Whitney JT9D|Pratt & Whitney JT9D-7A]] turbofans ''or''<br/>-**four [[Rolls-Royce RB211|Rolls-Royce RB211-524B2]] turbofans <br/>-*'''747-200/300'''<br/>-**four [[Pratt & Whitney JT9D|Pratt & Whitney JT9D-7R4G2]] turbofans ''or''<br/>-**four [[Rolls-Royce RB211|Rolls-Royce RB211-524D4]] turbofans ''or''<br/>-**four [[General Electric CF6-50|General Electric CF6-50E2]] turbofans<br/>-*'''747-400'''<br/>-**four [[Pratt & Whitney PW4000|Pratt & Whitney PW4062]] turbofans ''or''<br/>-**four [[Rolls-Royce RB211|Rolls-Royce RB211-524H]] turbofans ''or''<br/>-**four [[General Electric CF6-80|General Electric CF6-80C2B5F]] turbofans<br/>+===Mercenaries in the Classic era===<br/> <br/>-==Facts & Trivia==<br/>+Many [[Greek]] mercenaries fought for the Persian empire during the early classic era. For example: <br/> <br/>-*A 747-400 has six million parts (half of which are fasteners) made in 33 different countries.<br/>-*Just one engine on a 747 produces more thrust than all four engines on an early model [[Boeing 707]] combined.<br/>-*When pressurised, a 747 fuselage holds over a ton of air.<br/>-*The 747-400 is about 25 percent more fuel efficient and twice as quiet as the 747-100.<br/>-*Early model 747s have more than seven hundred pounds (300 kg) of depleted [[uranium]] molded into the engine nacelles.  Its purpose is as ballast to prevent the wing from fluttering.<br/>-*One of the original 747 design proposals was a full double decker, similar to the [[Airbus A380]].  Boeing dropped the idea at the eleventh hour, arguing that a wide single decker would be both more economical to operate and safer.<br/>-*During the flight certification period, Boeing built a bizarre training device known as "Waddell's Wagon" (named after the 747 test pilot, Jack Waddell) which consisted of a mock-up cockpit mounted on the roof of a truck.  It was intended to train pilots on how to taxi the aircraft from the high upper deck position.<br/>-*At the time of its launch, the term "jumbo jet" had already been coined by the media to describe a general class of new wide-bodied airliners then being developed, including the [[Lockheed L-1011]] TriStar and [[Douglas DC-10]]. Boeing were quite keen to discourage the media and the public using the term "jumbo jet" for the 747, but their efforts were in vain, and now the term is synonymous with the 747.<br/>-*The 747SP was originally intended to be known as the 747SB (the SB logically standing for "Short Body", before it was nicknamed "Sutter's Balloon" by Boeing employees, being named after 747 chief engineer Joe Sutter)  The eventual name "Special Performance" was used instead.<br/>-*Due to its immense length, there is a very small flexure of the fuselage in flight. This effect was not anticipated in the design of the autopilot on early models, and so there is a very slow oscillation in yaw when flying on autopilot. This was first discovered on an overseas flight to the Paris Airshow, when some of the people in the rear got air sick. Upon return the plane went thru a shake test for two weeks to sort out the problem and adjust the yaw damper system which solves the problem and the effect is now too small to be noticeable by passengers.<br/>+* [[Xerxes I]], king of Persia, who invaded [[Greece]] in [[484 BC]] employed Greek mercenaries. The best rembered is [[Demaratus]], for his warning to Xerxes not to under estimate the [[Spartans]] before the [[Battle of Thermopylae]].<br/> <br/>-==Disasters==<br/>+* In [[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]], [[Xenophon]] recounts how [[Cyrus the Younger]] hired a large a large army of Greek mercenaries in [[401 BC]] to seize the throne of [[Persia]] from his brother, [[Artaxerxes II]]. Though Cyrus' army was victorious in a battle in Babylon, Cyrus himself was killed in battle and the expedition rendered moot. Stranded deep in enemy territory, most of the Greek generals were subsequently killed or captured by treachery. Xenophon played an instrumental role in encouraging the Greek army of 10,000 to march north to the [[Black Sea]] in an epic fighting retreat.<br/> <br/>-747 aircraft have been involved in a number of air disasters.  However, very few have been due to design flaws in the aircraft itself: most have been because of pilot error, or in a few cases, terrorist action.<br/>-*[[Lufthansa flight 540]], Nairobi, 1974<br/>-*[[Tenerife Airport Disaster]], 1977<br/>-*[[Air-India flight 855]], Arabian Sea, 1978<br/>-*[[Korean Air flight 007]], Sea of Okhotsk, 1983<br/>-*[[Avianca flight 011]], Madrid, 1983<br/>-*[[Air-India flight 182]], Atlantic Ocean, 1985<br/>-*[[Japan Airlines flight 123]], Tokyo, 1985<br/>-*[[South African Airways flight 295]], Indian Ocean, 1987<br/>-*[[Pan Am flight 103]], Lockerbie, 1988<br/>-*[[China Airlines flight 358]], Taiwan, 1991<br/>-*[[Bijlmermeer disaster|El Al cargo flight]], Amsterdam 1992<br/>-*[[Philippine Airlines Flight 434]], Okinawa, 1994<br/>-*[[TWA Flight 800]], Long Island, 1996<br/>-*[[Saudia flight 763]], Delhi, 1996<br/>-*[[Korean Air flight 801]], Guam, 1997<br/>-*[[Singapore Airlines flight 006]], Taipei, 2000<br/>-*[[China Airlines flight 611]], Penghu Islands, 2002<br/>+[[Carthage]] contracted [[Balearic|Balearic Islands]] shepherds as [[Sling (weapon)|sling]]shooters during the [[Punic wars]] against Rome.<br/> <br/>-==Airlines==<br/>+In the late [[Roman Empire]], it became increasingly difficult for Emperors and generals to raise military units from the citizenry for various reasons: lack of manpower, lack of time available for training, lack of materials, and, inevitably, political considerations. Therefore, beginning in the late 4th century, the empire often contracted whole bands of [[barbarian]]s either within the [[legion]]s or as autonomous [[foederati]]. The barbarians were [[Romanization|Romanized]] and surviving veterans were established in areas requiring population. The [[Varangian#Varangian Guard|Varangian Guard]] of the Eastern Roman Emipre otherwise known as the [[Byzantine Empire]] is the best known formation made up of barbarian mercenaries.  The future king [[Harald III of Norway]], also known as Harald Hardrada ("Hardreign"), who arrived in Constantinople in [[1035]] was employed as a Varangian Guard. He participated in eighteen battles and became Akolythos, the commander, of the Guard before returning home in [[1043]].  He was killed at the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]] by the army of King [[Harold Godwinson]] of England in [[1066]].<br/> <br/>-Most international airlines use the 747 on their busiest routes.  However, as point-to-point international service between midsize cities has become more prevalent, some major airlines have replaced their 747's with  smaller and more efficient twinjet aircraft.  [[American Airlines]], [[Continental Airlines]], and [[Delta Air Lines]] are among the larger carriers to discontinue the 747.  Other airlines that have removed the type from their fleet include [[Aer Lingus]], [[Scandinavian Airlines System|SAS]], [[TAP]], and [[Olympic Airways]].<br/>+===Mercenaries in  [[Medieval warfare]]===<br/>+[[Byzantine]] Emperors followed the Roman practise and contracted foreigners especially for their personal [[corps]] guard. They were chosen among war-prone peoples. Since they didn't have links to the Greeks, they were expected to be ready to suffocate rebellions. [[Varangian]]s and [[Anglo-Saxon|Anglo-Saxons]] were elected for this service.<br/> <br/>-==Future Development==<br/>+In Italy, the ''condottiero'' was a military chief offering his troops, the [[condottieri]], to [[city-state]]s.<br/> <br/>-The 747 is unique in that it is the only Boeing jetliner never to be stretched beyond its original design length.  This has been mainly due to the uncertain economics of the commercial airline business, and the lack of suitable engines.  Many different stretching schemes for the 747 have been proposed, but none have come to fruition.  The 747-X program was launched in [[1996]], and was intended to be Boeing's response to [[Airbus]]' [[Airbus A380|A3XX]] proposal.  The 747-X would have consisted of the 747-500X and 747-600X which would have provided seating for up to 800 passengers.  General Electric and P&W formed the [[Engine Alliance]] and designed the [[Engine Alliance GP7200|GP7200]] turbofan to power the stretched 747.  Airlines however would have preferred Boeing to develop an all-new design instead of an updated 747, and the plan was dropped after a few months.<br/>+During the ages of the [[Taifa]] kingdoms of the Iberian peninsula, Christian knights like [[the Cid]] could fight for some Muslim ruler against his Christian or Muslim enemies.<br/> <br/>-When the [[Airbus A380]] was formally launched in [[2000]], Boeing dusted off its 747-X studies in a bid to thwart sales of the Airbus competitor.  But once again airlines weren't interested, and Boeing cancelled the program in [[2001]] after no orders were forthcoming, and devoted its energies to the ill-fated [[Boeing Sonic Cruiser|Sonic Cruiser]].  Some of the ideas developed for the 747-X did however make it into production in the 747-400ER.<br/>+The [[Almogavares]] fought for [[Aragon]] but in [[Catalan Company|their expedition to Orient]], they followed [[Roger de Flor]] in the service of the Byzantine Empire.<br/> <br/>-The long-term future of the 747 is now in doubt.  Despite Boeing's claims that the [[Airbus A380|A380]] can never be profitable, Airbus have already sold over 120 of the giant aircraft.  Previously loyal 747 customers such as [[Qantas]], [[Virgin Atlantic]] and [[Singapore Airlines]] have all ordered the A380, and sales of the passenger 747 have dwindled to almost nothing - the vast majority of 747s made now are freighters.  Boeing has promised that it will always be ready to produce larger, more advanced versions of the 747 when the market for such a plane develops, but industry analysts are already predicting the end for the 35-year old giant.<br/>+See also: [[Bertrand Duguesclin]], [[White Company]], [[Scottish clan]].<br/> <br/>-Nonetheless, in early [[2004]], Boeing rolled out tentative plans for what it calls the 747-Advanced.  As the first A380 prototypes edged ever closer to their first flight, this was clearly evidence that the company was still prepared to mount a challenge to Airbus.  Essentially another "recycle" of 747-X plan, the stretched [[Boeing 747 Advanced|747A]] intends to use technology from the [[7E7 Dreamliner]] to bring the 747 into the new millenium.  Time will tell, if Boeing manages to get this "paper airplane" into production.<br/>+===Mercenaries in the Modern Age===<br/> <br/>-==List of 747 Images==<br/>-*[[Air France]]<br/>-*[[Air New Zealand]]<br/>-*[[All Nippon Airways]]<br/>-*[[British Airways]]<br/>-*[[Delta Air Lines]]<br/>-*[[El Al]]<br/>-*[[Japan Airlines]]<br/>-*[[Korean Air]]<br/>-*[[Pakistan International Airlines]]<br/>-*[[Singapore Airlines]]<br/>+[[Switzerland|Swiss]] mercenaries were sought after during the latter half of the [[15th century]] as being an effective fighting force, until their somewhat rigid battle formations became vulnerable to [[Harquebus|arquebus]]es and [[artillery]] being developed at about that period.<br/> <br/>-==External links==<br/>-* [http://www.boeing.com/commercial/747family/ Boeing.com]<br/>-* [http://www.newairplane.com/747e-brochure/ Boeing 747 e-brochure] - [[Macromedia Flash|Flash animation]]<br/>-* [http://www.airliners.net/info/stats.main?id=97 Airliners.net - Boeing 747-100 & 200]<br/>-* [http://www.airliners.net/info/stats.main?id=99 Airliners.net - Boeing 747-300]<br/>-* [http://www.airliners.net/info/stats.main?id=100 Airliners.net - Boeing 747-400]<br/>-* [http://www.gocalipso.com/aircraft/boeing747/boeing747.php Calipso: Boeing 747 Information & History]<br/>-* [http://www.aircraft-info.net/aircraft/jet_aircraft/boeing/747-400/ Aircraft-Info.net - Boeing 747-400]<br/>-* [http://www.planemad.net/data/list/Boeing/747/ Planemad.net - Boeing 747 Production Lists]<br/>+It was then that the [[European]] [[landsknecht]]s, colorful mercenaries with a redoubtable reputation, took over the Swiss forces' legacy and became the most formidable force of the late 15th and throughout the [[16th century]], being hired by all the powers in [[Europe]] and often fighting at opposite sides.<br/> <br/>-{| cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" style="margin:5px auto; border:3px solid;width:60%; font-size:small;" align="center"<br/>-!bgcolor="#87CEEB" colspan="2" align="center" style="border-bottom:3px solid"|Related content<br/>-|-<br/>-|'''Related Development'''<br/>-|align="center"|<br/>-[[Boeing E-4]] -<br/>-[[Boeing VC-25]] -<br/>-[[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]]<br/>-|-<br/>-|'''Similar Aircraft'''<br/>-|align="center"|<br/>-[[Airbus A340]] - <br/>-[[Airbus A380]] - <br/>-[[Ilyushin Il-96]]<br/>-|-<br/>-|'''Designation Series'''<br/>-|align="center"|<br/>-[[Boeing 707|707]] - <br/>-[[Boeing 717|717]] - <br/>-[[Boeing 727|727]] - <br/>-[[Boeing 737|737]] - <br/>-'''747''' - <br/>-[[Boeing 757|757]] - <br/>-[[Boeing 767|767]] - <br/>-[[Boeing 777|777]] - <br/>-[[Boeing 7E7|7E7]] -<br/>-[[Boeing 747 Advanced|747A]]<br/>-|-<br/>-|'''Related Lists'''<br/>-|align="center"|<br/>-[[List of airliners]] - [[List of civil aircraft]]<br/>-|-<br/>-|}<br/>+St [[Thomas More]] in his [[Utopia]] advocated the use of mercenaries in preference to citizens.<br/> <br/>-{{airlistbox}}<br/>+== Mercenaries in Popular Culture ==<br/> <br/>+Like [[piracy]], the mercenary ethos resonates with idealized adventure, mystery and danger. examples of this are:<br/>+* The novel ''Dogs of War'' by Frederick Forsyth and the movie (1981) with the same name, goes into some detail about an actual if fictionalized mercenary operation in Africa in the 1960s.<br/>+* The novel ''The Wild Geese'' by [[Daniel Carney]] and the movie(1978) with the same name.

For more images of the 747 see list at bottom of page]]<br/>+A '''mercenary''' is a [[soldier]] who fights for [[money]], regardless of ideological, national or political considerations.  When addressed to a professional [[soldier]] in a regular national army, the term is normally used as an insult or epithet.<br/> <br/>-The '''[[Boeing]] 747''', also popularly known as the '''jumbo jet''', is the second largest passenger [[airliner]] after [[Airbus A380]], but it remains the largest [[aircraft]] in commercial service. The four-engine 747, produced by [[Boeing Commercial Airplanes]], combines passenger-carrying capacities of up to 550 people with its unique [[double decker|two-deck]] configuration (the small upper deck is usually used for business-class passengers).  A typical mixed-class layout would accommodate about 380 passengers.   The 747 flies at high-subsonic speeds (typically 0.85 Mach or 565 [[mph]] or 909 [[km/h]]) and features intercontinental range (8,430 statute miles, or 13,570 km, for the 747-400 version), in some configurations sufficient to fly New York-Hong Kong (roughly a third of the globe) non-stop.  By [http://active.boeing.com/commercial/orders/displaystandardreport.cfm?cboCurrentModel=747&optReportType=AllModels&cboAllModel=747&ViewReportF=View+Report  May 2004], a total of 1381 aircraft have been built or ordered in various 747 configurations.<br/>+== Mercenaries and the Laws of War ==<br/> <br/>-==Historical Background==<br/>+See also [[laws_of_war|Laws of War]].<br/> <br/>-The 747 was born out of the explosion of the popularity of air travel in the [[1960]]s.  The enormous popularity of the [[Boeing 707]] had revolutionised long distance travel in the world, and had began the concept of the "global village" made possible by jet revolution.  Boeing had already developed a study for a very large airplane when it was bidding on a US military contract for a huge airlifter.  Boeing lost the contract to [[Lockheed]], but came under pressure from its most loyal airline customer [[Pan Am]] to develop a giant passenger plane which would be over twice the size of the 707.  In [[1966]], Boeing had proposed a preliminary configuration for the giant airliner, which was to be called the 747, and Pan Am got the ball rolling with an order for 25 of the initial -100 series.  Boeing took the shrewd move and designed the 747 so that it could easily be adapted to a freighter, knowing that when sales of the passenger version dried up, then the aircraft could remain in production.  The cockpit was moved to an upper deck so that a nose cone loading door could be included, thus creating the 747's distinctive "bulge", which was initially used as a luxurious first-class lounge/bar area, but as time went on was used for extra seating capacity.<br/>+In the '''Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions'''(GC) of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts '''(Protocol I), 8 June 1977''' it is stated:<br/> <br/>-The development of the 747 was a huge undertaking.  Boeing didn't have a factory big enough to assemble the giant aircraft, so had to build an all-new assembly building near [[Everett, Washington]].  [[Pratt and Whitney]] developed a massive [[high-bypass turbofan engine]], the [[JT9D]] that was, in the beginning, exclusively for the 747. In order to appease concerns about the safety and flyability of such a massive aircraft, the 747 was designed with no less than four backup [[hydraulic]] systems, split control surfaces, multiple structural redundancy, and sophisticated flaps which allow it to use standard-length runways.  <br/>+''Art 47. Mercenaries<br/> <br/>-Boeing had promised the 747 to Pan Am by [[1970]], so it had less than four years to develop, build and test the 747.  Work progressed at such a breakneck pace that all those who worked on the development of the 747 were given the nickname "The Incredibles".  The massive cost of developing the 747 and building the Everett factory meant that Boeing had gambled its very existence on the 747's success, and very nearly bankrupted the company in the early [[1970s]].  The gamble paid off however, and Boeing enjoyed a monopoly on very large passenger transports that has only been broken 35-years later with the advent of the [[Airbus A380]].<br/>+:''A mercenary is any person who:<br/>+::''(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;is specially recruited locally or abroad in order to fight in an armed conflict;<br/>+::''(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;does, in fact, take a direct part in the hostilities;<br/>+::''(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;is motivated to take part in the hostilities essentially by the desire for private gain and, in fact, is promised, by or on behalf of a Party to the conflict, material compensation substantially in excess of that promised or paid to combatants of similar ranks and functions in the armed forces of that Party;<br/>+::''(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;is neither a national of a Party to the conflict nor a resident of territory controlled by a Party to the conflict;<br/>+::''(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;is not a member of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict; and<br/>+::''(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;has not been sent by a State which is not a Party to the conflict on official duty as a member of its armed forces.<br/> <br/>-The fact that Boeing had to "bet the farm", and came through with a revolutionary product is often contrasted with [[Airbus]], which is given risk free loans for their developement projects.<br/>+It should be noted that as many countries including the U.S. are not signatory to the ''Protocol Additional GC 1977''(APGC77). So APGC77 art 47 can best be seen as a guide to what a mercenary is. However without an agreed international definition it is the best around.<br/> <br/>-==Variants==<br/>+Under [[Third_Geneva_Convention| GC III]] if a soldier is captured by an enemy, he must be treated as a [[lawful combatant]] and therefore a ''Protected Person'' which for a soldier is as a Prisoner of War (POW) until the soldier has faced a '''competent tribunal''' (GC III Art 5). That tribunal may decide that the person is a mercenary using criteria in APGC77 or some domestic law equivalent. At that point the mercenary becomes an [[unlawful combatant]] but they must still be "''treated with humanity and, in case of trial, shall not be deprived of the rights of fair and regular trial''", because they are still covered by [[Fourth Geneva Convention|GC IV]] Art 5.  The only exception to GC IV Art 5 is if they a national of the  authority which is holding them but in which case they would not be a mercenary under APGC77 Art 47.d.<br/> <br/>-===747-100===<br/>+If after a regular trial, a captured soldier is found to be a mercenary, then they can  expect to be treated as common criminals and may face execution. As they are not POWs they can not expect repatriation at the end of the war. The best known, post World War II, example of this was on [[June 28]] [[1976]] an Angolan court sentenced four mercenaries to death and nine others to prison terms ranging from 16 to 30 years. The three Britons and an American were shot by a firing squad on [[July 10]] [[1976]].<br/> <br/>-The first edition of the jet, the 747-100, rolled out of the new Everett facility  on [[2 September]] [[1969]]. This factory is the largest building ever built. The 747-100 entered service in [[1970]] with launch customer [[Pan American World Airways]].  It was later replaced by the '''747-100B''', a very similar aircraft with a stronger airframe and [[undercarriage]] design.  Another -100 variant, the '''747-100SR''', has a capacity of up to 550 passengers and is used on domestic flights in [[Japan]].  The basic -100 has a range of about 4,500 miles with full load.<br/>+The legal status of civilian contractors depends upon the nature of their work and their nationality in respect of the combatants.  But if they have not ''in fact, taken a direct part in the hostilities'' (APGC77 Art 47.b) they are not mercenaries and are entitled to the protection of the Geneva Conventions.  <br/> <br/>-747-100 aircraft can usually be distinguished by the upper deck, which normally has only three windows.  There are exceptions.  Also, some airlines purchased "SUD," or "stretched upper deck" modifications, which make the upper deck almost identical to a 747-300. <br/>+The situation during [[2003 Occupation of Iraq|Occupation of Iraq 2003 &ndash;]] shows how difficult it is to define what a  mercenary is. While the United States governed the country any U.S. citizen who worked as a armed guard could not be called a mercenary because they were ''a national of a Party to the conflict'' (APGC77 Art 47.d). With the handover of power to the interim Iraqi government it could be argued that unless they declare that they are a resident in Iraq ie ''a resident of territory controlled by a Party to the conflict'' (APGC77 Art 47.d), they are now mercenaries. It should be noted that Coalition soldiers in Iraq which are supporting the interim Iraqi government are not mercenaries, because either they are  part of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict or they have been ''sent by a State which is not a Party to the conflict on official duty as a member of its armed forces'' (APGC77 Art 47.f).<br/> <br/>-===747-200===<br/>+See also [[privateer]], [[Letter of marque]], [[private military contractor]]<br/> <br/>-Introduced in [[1971]], and further improved over successive years,  the 747-200 has higher thrust and weight-lifting capability than the 747-100,  flying farther.  It can usually be distinguished by its eight-window upper deck (but, again, some airlines have given their -200 aircraft SUD, and a few early -200's had just 3 windows).  The last models of the -200, built in the late 1980's, have a full load range of about 6,700 miles.<br/>+=== Gurkhas and French Foreign Legionnaires are not mercenaries ===<br/> <br/>-The 747-200C and -200F variants were designed to carry air freight.  The '''747-200F''' is a pure freighter, the '''747-200C''' is a "convertible" aircraft that can carry either passengers or freight.  A sub-variant is unofficially called the '''747-200M''' and is a "combi" aircraft that can carry both at the same time.  Like the -100, many -200's have been given a new lease of life by being converted into freight aircraft, rather than being scrapped.<br/>+The two best known units in which nationals of a country serve in another nation's armed forces are the British [[Brigade of Gurkhas]] and the [[French Foreign Legion]]. Soldiers who serve in these two elite units are not mercenaries.<br/> <br/>-===747SP===<br/>+British Gurkhas are fully integrated soldiers of the [[British Army]]. They operate in formed units of the Brigade of Gurkhas and abide by the rules and regulations under which all British soldiers serve,[http://www.army.mod.uk/brigade_of_gurkhas/gurkha_employment/tacos/index.htm](''Similar rules apply for Gurkhas serving in [[Indian Army]])''. French Foreign Legionnaires are in formed units of the [[French Foreign Legion]] which is deployed and fights as an organized unit of the [[French Army]]. This means that as member of the armed forces of Britain or France then under APGC77 Art 47.e and APGC77 Art 47.f they can not be mercenaries.<br/> <br/>-The 747SP, or "Special Performance," was first delivered in [[1976]].  The SP was largely a stop-gap model to compete with the [[DC-10|Douglas DC-10]] and [[Lockheed Tristar|Lockheed L-1011 TriStar]].  The 747 was simply too big for many routes, and Boeing didn't have a mid-sized widebody to compete in the segment of the market that the DC-10 and TriStar had created.  Crippled by the huge costs it had incurred in developing both the 737 and 747 in the late [[1960]]s, Boeing could not afford to develop an all-new design, so instead it shortened the 747 and reoptimised it for speed and range at the expense of capacity.  The SP could only accommodate 220 passengers in a 3-class cabin, but could fly over 6,500 miles at speeds of up to 610 [[mph]].  Some airline insiders call it the "74 Short" or "Baby Jumbo" because of its shortened fuselage, and stubby appearance.<br/>+=== Mercenaries and domestic law ===<br/> <br/>-The 747SP was the longest-flying airliner available until the [[Airbus A340]], and found its way into the fleets of [[American Airlines]], [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]], and [[Qantas]], airlines that needed its range for trans-South Pacific routes. (American later used its 747SP's for services to [[Tokyo]].)  <br/>+Some countries try to stop their citizens fighting in conflicts unless they are under the control of their own armed forces. For example under United States law (the &quot;Neutrality Act&quot;), an American citizen who participates in an armed conflict to which the United States is neutral may be subject to criminal penalties.<br/> <br/>-For all its technical achievements, the SP never sold as well as Boeing hoped, only 44 were ever built and most that are still in service are used by operators in the [[Middle East]] and [[Africa]].<br/>+== Mercenary Operations ==<br/> <br/>-===747-300===<br/>+It is known that mercenaries have been hired to fight in the conflicts in former Yugoslavia.  Many of these were ex-Eastern Bloc soldiers who had no employment opportunities after the fall of the Soviet Union.<br/> <br/>-The 747-300 was introduced in [[1980]], and was the first 747 model to feature a "stretched upper deck," which increased its capacity over earlier models.  Combi ('''747-300M''') and Japanese domestic ('''747-300SR''') models were also built.  The upper deck was now accessed via a straight staircase, rather than the spiral steps that featured in the -100 and -200.<br/>+The largest mercenary outfit engaged in actual warfare, [[Executive Outcomes]], consists largely of former members of the then white-dominated South African military. EO operates in battalion strength with organic helicopter gunship support.  Corporations such as this are known as [[private military company|private military companies]], and tend to be frowned upon by the [[United Nations]] (even so, the UN hired Executive Outcomes to do some logistic support in Africa).  Nevertheless, some people suggest that PMCs may be useful in combatting [[genocide]]s and slaughters in situations where the UN is unwilling or unable to intervene.<br/> <br/>-===747-400===<br/>+It could be argued that [[paramilitary]] forces under private control are functionally mercenaries instead of [[security guard]]s.  However, national governments reserve the right to strictly regulate the number, nature and armaments of such private forces.<br/> <br/>-The 747-400 is the latest model of the 747, and also the only series still in production. It added [[winglet]]s, an all-new [[glass cockpit]] which dispensed with the need for a flight engineer, tail fuel tanks, revised engines, an all-new interior, and newer in-flight entertainment to the basic design of the -300 series.  It first entered service in [[1989]] with Northwest Airlines.<br/>+== Mercenaries in Africa ==<br/> <br/>-The -400 is available in combi ('''747-400M''') and freighter ('''747-400F''') variants.  The Japanese domestic variant, the '''747-400D''', is the highest-capacity passenger aircraft in the world, capable of carrying 568 passengers.  <br/>+In the 20th century, mercenaries have been mostly involved in conflicts on the continent of Africa.  There have been a number of unsavory incidents in the brushfire wars of Africa, some involving recruitment of naive European and American men "looking for adventure" and thrusting them into combat situations where they would not survive to get paid.<br/> <br/>-The '''747-400ER''' is 400's extended range version: it also comes in an all-freight version, the '''747-400ERF'''.<br/>-Plans to develop a new model, the '''747-400XQLR''', which stood for Extra Quiet Long-Range, were shelved.<br/>+Many of the adventurers in Africa who have been described as mercenaries were in fact ideologically motivated to support particular governments, and would not fight "for the highest bidder."<br/> <br/>-As yet unnamed, Boeing will convert four passenger 747-400 aircraft into an outsize configuration, in order to ferry [[Boeing 7E7|7E7]] parts to [[Everett, Washington|Everett]], [[Washington]] for final assembly.<br/>+Particularly notorious mercenaries include [[Mike Hoare]] and [[Bob Denard]]:<br/>+* '''Mike Hoare''' was involved in the [[Congo War]] in the early 1960s and a [[Seychelles]] failed [[coup]] in 1978.<br/>+* '''Bob Denard''' was involved in numerous African campaigns in many countries often with the covert support of France. However his particular speciality was intervening in the [[Comoros]]. The last time was in [[1995]], when he staged a coup which failed, thanks to French Government intervention.<br/> <br/>-===747 Advanced===<br/>+Mercenaries fought for the Biafrans in the 4th Commando Brigade during the [[Nigerian Civil War]], (1967&ndash;1970). Other mercenaries flew aircraft for the Biafrans. In October 1966, for example, a Royal Air Burundi DC-4M Argonaut, flown by a mercenary Heinrich Wartski also known Henry Wharton, crashlanded in Cameroun with military supplies destined for Biafra.<br/> <br/>-Boeing is now working with airlines  to create a new 747 which will use same engine and cockpit technology as the [[Boeing 7E7|7E7]] . The new [[Boeing 747 Advanced|747]] will be quieter, more economical and environmentally friendly. It will be capable of carrying up to 500 passengers in a 3-class configuration and fly over 8,000-nautical-miles ( 14,816 km) at .86 Mach.<br/>+In the middle [[1970s]] John Banks a Briton recruited mercenaries to fight for the ''National Front for the Liberation of Angola'' [[FNLA]] against the ''Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola'' ([[MPLA]]) in the civil war that broke out when Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975.  When captured John Derek Barker's role as a leader of mercenaries in Northern Angola led the judges to send him to face the firing squad. 3 others were executed and 9 imprisoned.<br/> <br/>-===Government and military models===<br/>+American Bob MacKenzie, was killed in the [[Malal Hills]] in February [[1995]] while commanding Gurkha Security Guards (GSG) in [[Sierra Leone]].<br/> <br/>-The current [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidential]] aircraft, [[VC-25A]], is among the most famous 747 models. It is popularly known as ''[[Air Force One]]'', even though that name refers to any [[United States Air Force]] aircraft carrying the President. VC-25A is based on the civilian Boeing 747-200. Other special 747s include the [[E-4B]] airborne emergency command and control post, modified 747s to transport the [[Space Shuttle]] ([[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]]), and [[aerial refueling]] [[tanker]]s.  A recent addition to the military's 747 arsenal is the experimental [[Airborne Laser]], a component of the [[National Missile Defense]] plan.<br/>+A fictional portrait of mercenary operations in the 1970s is [[Frederick Forsyth]]'s book, ''[[The Dogs of War]]'' was set on the island of Malabo which was renamed Zangoro and given  an uranium deposit. Since the discovery of oil there in the mid 1990s, it does not need a fictional uranium deposit for it to be of interest to financiers and mercenaries. In August 2004 there was the a plot to overthrow the government of [[Malabo]].

For example: <br/> <br/>-*A 747-400 has six million parts (half of which are fasteners) made in 33 different countries.<br/>-*Just one engine on a 747 produces more thrust than all four engines on an early model [[Boeing 707]] combined.<br/>-*When pressurised, a 747 fuselage holds over a ton of air.<br/>-*The 747-400 is about 25 percent more fuel efficient and twice as quiet as the 747-100.<br/>-*Early model 747s have more than seven hundred pounds (300 kg) of depleted [[uranium]] molded into the engine nacelles.  Its purpose is as ballast to prevent the wing from fluttering.<br/>-*One of the original 747 design proposals was a full double decker, similar to the [[Airbus A380]].  Boeing dropped the idea at the eleventh hour, arguing that a wide single decker would be both more economical to operate and safer.<br/>-*During the flight certification period, Boeing built a bizarre training device known as "Waddell's Wagon" (named after the 747 test pilot, Jack Waddell) which consisted of a mock-up cockpit mounted on the roof of a truck.  It was intended to train pilots on how to taxi the aircraft from the high upper deck position.<br/>-*At the time of its launch, the term "jumbo jet" had already been coined by the media to describe a general class of new wide-bodied airliners then being developed, including the [[Lockheed L-1011]] TriStar and [[Douglas DC-10]]. Boeing were quite keen to discourage the media and the public using the term "jumbo jet" for the 747, but their efforts were in vain, and now the term is synonymous with the 747.<br/>-*The 747SP was originally intended to be known as the 747SB (the SB logically standing for "Short Body", before it was nicknamed "Sutter's Balloon" by Boeing employees, being named after 747 chief engineer Joe Sutter)  The eventual name "Special Performance" was used instead.<br/>-*Due to its immense length, there is a very small flexure of the fuselage in flight. This effect was not anticipated in the design of the autopilot on early models, and so there is a very slow oscillation in yaw when flying on autopilot. This was first discovered on an overseas flight to the Paris Airshow, when some of the people in the rear got air sick. Upon return the plane went thru a shake test for two weeks to sort out the problem and adjust the yaw damper system which solves the problem and the effect is now too small to be noticeable by passengers.<br/>+* [[Xerxes I]], king of Persia, who invaded [[Greece]] in [[484 BC]] employed Greek mercenaries. The best rembered is [[Demaratus]], for his warning to Xerxes not to under estimate the [[Spartans]] before the [[Battle of Thermopylae]].<br/> <br/>-==Disasters==<br/>+* In [[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]], [[Xenophon]] recounts how [[Cyrus the Younger]] hired a large a large army of Greek mercenaries in [[401 BC]] to seize the throne of [[Persia]] from his brother, [[Artaxerxes II]]. Though Cyrus' army was victorious in a battle in Babylon, Cyrus himself was killed in battle and the expedition rendered moot. Stranded deep in enemy territory, most of the Greek generals were subsequently killed or captured by treachery. Xenophon played an instrumental role in encouraging the Greek army of 10,000 to march north to the [[Black Sea]] in an epic fighting retreat.<br/> <br/>-747 aircraft have been involved in a number of air disasters.  However, very few have been due to design flaws in the aircraft itself: most have been because of pilot error, or in a few cases, terrorist action.<br/>-*[[Lufthansa flight 540]], Nairobi, 1974<br/>-*[[Tenerife Airport Disaster]], 1977<br/>-*[[Air-India flight 855]], Arabian Sea, 1978<br/>-*[[Korean Air flight 007]], Sea of Okhotsk, 1983<br/>-*[[Avianca flight 011]], Madrid, 1983<br/>-*[[Air-India flight 182]], Atlantic Ocean, 1985<br/>-*[[Japan Airlines flight 123]], Tokyo, 1985<br/>-*[[South African Airways flight 295]], Indian Ocean, 1987<br/>-*[[Pan Am flight 103]], Lockerbie, 1988<br/>-*[[China Airlines flight 358]], Taiwan, 1991<br/>-*[[Bijlmermeer disaster|El Al cargo flight]], Amsterdam 1992<br/>-*[[Philippine Airlines Flight 434]], Okinawa, 1994<br/>-*[[TWA Flight 800]], Long Island, 1996<br/>-*[[Saudia flight 763]], Delhi, 1996<br/>-*[[Korean Air flight 801]], Guam, 1997<br/>-*[[Singapore Airlines flight 006]], Taipei, 2000<br/>-*[[China Airlines flight 611]], Penghu Islands, 2002<br/>+[[Carthage]] contracted [[Balearic|Balearic Islands]] shepherds as [[Sling (weapon)|sling]]shooters during the [[Punic wars]] against Rome.<br/> <br/>-==Airlines==<br/>+In the late [[Roman Empire]], it became increasingly difficult for Emperors and generals to raise military units from the citizenry for various reasons: lack of manpower, lack of time available for training, lack of materials, and, inevitably, political considerations. Therefore, beginning in the late 4th century, the empire often contracted whole bands of [[barbarian]]s either within the [[legion]]s or as autonomous [[foederati]]. The barbarians were [[Romanization|Romanized]] and surviving veterans were established in areas requiring population. The [[Varangian#Varangian Guard|Varangian Guard]] of the Eastern Roman Emipre otherwise known as the [[Byzantine Empire]] is the best known formation made up of barbarian mercenaries.  The future king [[Harald III of Norway]], also known as Harald Hardrada ("Hardreign"), who arrived in Constantinople in [[1035]] was employed as a Varangian Guard. He participated in eighteen battles and became Akolythos, the commander, of the Guard before returning home in [[1043]].  He was killed at the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]] by the army of King [[Harold Godwinson]] of England in [[1066]].<br/> <br/>-Most international airlines use the 747 on their busiest routes.  However, as point-to-point international service between midsize cities has become more prevalent, some major airlines have replaced their 747's with  smaller and more efficient twinjet aircraft.  [[American Airlines]], [[Continental Airlines]], and [[Delta Air Lines]] are among the larger carriers to discontinue the 747.  Other airlines that have removed the type from their fleet include [[Aer Lingus]], [[Scandinavian Airlines System|SAS]], [[TAP]], and [[Olympic Airways]].<br/>+===Mercenaries in  [[Medieval warfare]]===<br/>+[[Byzantine]] Emperors followed the Roman practise and contracted foreigners especially for their personal [[corps]] guard. They were chosen among war-prone peoples. Since they didn't have links to the Greeks, they were expected to be ready to suffocate rebellions.

This has been mainly due to the uncertain economics of the commercial airline business, and the lack of suitable engines.  Many different stretching schemes for the 747 have been proposed, but none have come to fruition.  The 747-X program was launched in [[1996]], and was intended to be Boeing's response to [[Airbus]]' [[Airbus A380|A3XX]] proposal.  The 747-X would have consisted of the 747-500X and 747-600X which would have provided seating for up to 800 passengers.  General Electric and P&W formed the [[Engine Alliance]] and designed the [[Engine Alliance GP7200|GP7200]] turbofan to power the stretched 747.  Airlines however would have preferred Boeing to develop an all-new design instead of an updated 747, and the plan was dropped after a few months.<br/>+During the ages of the [[Taifa]] kingdoms of the Iberian peninsula, Christian knights like [[the Cid]] could fight for some Muslim ruler against his Christian or Muslim enemies.<br/> <br/>-When the [[Airbus A380]] was formally launched in [[2000]], Boeing dusted off its 747-X studies in a bid to thwart sales of the Airbus competitor.  But once again airlines weren't interested, and Boeing cancelled the program in [[2001]] after no orders were forthcoming, and devoted its energies to the ill-fated [[Boeing Sonic Cruiser|Sonic Cruiser]].  Some of the ideas developed for the 747-X did however make it into production in the 747-400ER.<br/>+The [[Almogavares]] fought for [[Aragon]] but in [[Catalan Company|their expedition to Orient]], they followed [[Roger de Flor]] in the service of the Byzantine Empire.<br/> <br/>-The long-term future of the 747 is now in doubt.  Despite Boeing's claims that the [[Airbus A380|A380]] can never be profitable, Airbus have already sold over 120 of the giant aircraft.  Previously loyal 747 customers such as [[Qantas]], [[Virgin Atlantic]] and [[Singapore Airlines]] have all ordered the A380, and sales of the passenger 747 have dwindled to almost nothing - the vast majority of 747s made now are freighters.  Boeing has promised that it will always be ready to produce larger, more advanced versions of the 747 when the market for such a plane develops, but industry analysts are already predicting the end for the 35-year old giant.<br/>+See also: [[Bertrand Duguesclin]], [[White Company]], [[Scottish clan]].<br/> <br/>-Nonetheless, in early [[2004]], Boeing rolled out tentative plans for what it calls the 747-Advanced.  As the first A380 prototypes edged ever closer to their first flight, this was clearly evidence that the company was still prepared to mount a challenge to Airbus.  Essentially another "recycle" of 747-X plan, the stretched [[Boeing 747 Advanced|747A]] intends to use technology from the [[7E7 Dreamliner]] to bring the 747 into the new millenium.

The most public face of the story is that in October 1980, an agreement was reached, after long negotiations, to unfreeze Iran's monetary assets for the safe return of the hostages - but not until after Reagan's inauguration on January 20, 1981. In the event, the hostages were released minutes after Reagan was sworn in as President.<br/>+Under the international [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]] (1968), a bicycle (or "cycle", as referenced by the convention) is defined to be a ''vehicle'' and a cyclist is considered to be a ''driver''.  In some jurisdictions, a bicycle is defined as a "device" rather than a vehicle, but in those cases usually the operator of a bicycle is afforded the "same rights and responsibilities" as a driver of a vehicle.  Often, cyclists are allowed additional privileges that motor vehicle drivers are not &#151; such as traveling on sidewalks in accordance to the pedestrian rules of the road. (Care must be taken with respect to this allowance as some jurisdictions do not permit sidewalk cycling; consult your local ordinances before practicing.) '''Vehicular cycling''' (VC), is riding a bicycle on roadways in accordance with the vehicular [[rules of the road]]. Sometimes '''vehicular cycling''' is referred to as '''integrated cycling''' (i.e. ''integrated'' with other vehicular traffic, as opposed to cycling in [[segregated cycle facilities|''segregated cycling facilities'']] ), '''cooperative cycling''', or '''bicycle driving'''.<br/> <br/>-The 1980 Reagan team spoke openly of their fear of an "October surprise" and had "reason to believe" [http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/library/congress/1992_cr/h920205-october-clips.htm] as [[Gary Sick]] has said, that the Carter administration would attempt another hostage rescue shortly before the election.  This was amply reported in the [[Wall Street Journal]] and other organizations contemporaneously to the event.<br/>+A ''vehicular/integrated/cooperative cyclist'', or ''bicycle driver'', is a cyclist who generally rides on roadways in accordance to the ''vehicular'' [[rules of the road]].  Primarily, this means:<br/> <br/>-The phrase "October surprise" also refers to any last minute trick by a party to sway an election, as US elections are traditionally held at the beginning of November.<br/>+* Riding on the same side of the road as other vehicular traffic.<br/>+* Riding outside of the [[door zone]]; no closer than five feet to parked cars.<br/>+* Obeying traffic controls (like stop signs and traffic signals).<br/>+* Choosing the appropriate lane and lateral lane position according to '''speed positioning''' between intersections.<br/>+* Choosing the appropriate lane and lateral lane position according to '''destination positioning''' at intersections and their approaches, including merging away from the side of the road before going straight across an intersection.<br/>+* Adjusting lateral lane position (moving left and right) relatively often in response to, and in anticipation of, ever-changing conditions and factors.<br/>+* '''Using the full lane''' when appropriate.<br/>+* Merging, one lane at a time, across a roadway to get to a turn lane, using '''negotiation''' with other drivers as required.<br/>+* Generally feeling and acting like a vehicle driver, albeit the driver of a narrow and relatively low-powered vehicle.<br/> <br/>-==Details==<br/>-Proponents of the theory, such as Barbara Honegger, a researcher and policy analyst with the 1980 Reagan/Bush campaign (interviewed in link), allege that [[William Casey]] and other representatives of the Reagan presidential campaign made a deal at two sets of meetings in July and August at the Ritz Hotel in Madrid with Iranians to delay the release of Americans held hostage in Iran until after the November 1980 presidential elections. The idea was that Reagan's opponent, the incumbent President Jimmy Carter, whose team had been negotiating, wouldn't gain a popularity boost (an 'October Surprise') before election day. The allegations included a date-specific allegation that William Casey met with an Iranian cleric in Madrid, Spain, and much of the tardy investigations have centered on whether, at the weekend in question he was actually at a [[Bohemian Grove]] retreat in California. Though William Casey was probably in London following the alleged meetings, critical pages of his daybook diary were unaccountably missing when the investigators came to look for them over a decade later.<br/>+While any cyclist riding on the roadway is bound to be riding "vehicularly" at least some of the time, few cyclists actually ride vehicularly consistently.  Some non-vehicular actions commonly taken by cyclists include:<br/>+* Cycling on the wrong side of the road.<br/>+* Cycling in the [[door zone]].<br/>+* Cycling on sidewalks or in crosswalks.<br/>+* Running stop signs.<br/>+* Running red lights.<br/>+* Going straight across an intersection from the side of the road from which right (left in England) turns are allowed and expected, and through travel is not expected.<br/>+* Turning left (right in England) from the side of the road and darting across the roadway, instead of merging across one lane at a time.<br/>+* Moving laterally without looking back over the shoulder.<br/>+* Stopping or cycling on stripes separating lanes instead of taking an assertive position within a lane.<br/>+* At red lights, moving to the front of traffic and stopping in the crosswalk or ahead of the stop line, instead of taking one's place in line according to the '''first come, first served''' principle.<br/>+* Passing slow or stopped traffic on the right (left in England).<br/>+* Cycling in the gutter or generally keep to the side, even when there is no same-direction faster traffic present.<br/>+* Cycling on the side of a lane that is too narrow to be safely shared side by side with other vehicles, thus inviting drivers of vehicles to try to squeeze into the narrow lane unsafely.<br/> <br/>-Carter was at the time dealing with the [[Iran hostage crisis]] and the hostile regime of the [[Ayatollah Khomeini]]. Those who assert that a deal was made allege that certain Republicans with [[CIA]] connections, including [[George H. W. Bush]], arranged to have the hostages held through October, until Reagan could defeat Carter in early November, and then be released.  The hostages were in fact released on the very day of Reagan's inauguration, twenty minutes after his inaugural address.<br/> <br/>-Two months earlier, in a campaigning interview, Ronald Reagan had said that he had a "secret plan" involving the hostages. "My ideas require quiet diplomacy," he had responded when pressed, "where you don't have to say what it is you're thinking of doing."<br/>+==Origins of Vehicular Cycling==<br/> <br/>-A 1981 Congressional probe into the Reagan campaign's theft of White House briefing books on the eve of a presidential debate disclosed that Reagan campaign manager William Casey (later appointed as  [[Director of Central Intelligence]] in the Reagan administration) was receiving highly classified reports on closely-held Carter administration intelligence on the Carter campaign and the Democratic president's efforts to liberate the hostages.<br/>+The origins of vehicular cycling go back to the 19th century when bicycles were invented and shared the roads with horses and buggies.  Cyclists have been riding in accordance to the vehicular rules of the road ever since.<br/> <br/>-===Chronology===<br/>-Chronology:<br/>+==Using the full lane==<br/> <br/>-* Sep. 22 (1980): Iraq invades Iran. <br/>-* Oct. 15-20: Meetings are held in Paris between emissaries of the Reagan-Bush campaign, with Mr. Casey as "key participant," and "high-level Iranian and Israeli representatives."<br/>-* Oct. 21: Iran, for reasons not explained, abruptly shifts its position in secret negotiations with the Carter administration and disclaims "further interest in receiving military equipment."<br/>-* Oct. 21-23: Israel secretly ships F-4 fighter-aircraft tires to Iran, in violation of the U.S. arms embargo, and Iran disperses the hostages to different locations.<br/>+Using the full lane, sometimes referred to as "taking the lane", is a vehicular cycling technique whereby a bicyclist commands full use of the lane instead of operating at its side. Riding at the side yields the right-of-way in the remainder of the lane, and enables motorists to use it, which sometimes is not safe or desired for the given circumstances. Using the full lane precludes sharing the lane simultaneously side-by-side with drivers of other vehicles. Experienced cyclists commonly use the full lane under the following circumstances:<br/> <br/>-==Investigations==<br/>-A [[PBS]] '[[Frontline]]' documentary in 1990 brought a sound bite unavoidably to the surface in detail, as did a [[15 April]] 1991 ''[[New York Times]]'' article by Gary Sick. In 1991, while playing golf with George Bush in Palm Springs, Ronald Reagan gave reporters a sound bite. In 1980, he had "tried some things the other way," that is, to free the hostages, he told them. When pressed he said that the details remained "classified."  The remark was widely publicized  and linked to Reagan's 1980 campaign remark undisclosed "secret plan" to free the hostages, with the unanswered question of how a Presidential candidate in 1980 had received "classified" information [http://www.carpenoctem.tv/cons/october.html].  <br/>+*When there is no other traffic moving in the same direction at the time, to increase visibility to any potential oncoming turning traffic and cross-traffic to prevent unsafe turns across the cyclist's path, and also to increase conspicuity for traffic approaching from the rear, <br/>+*when traveling at the normal speed of traffic moving in the same direction at that time, <br/>+*when the lane is too narrow for a bicycle and a vehicle to travel safely side by side within the lane, <br/>+*when merging across a roadway in preparation for a turn across the opposing lanes, <br/>+*when overtaking or passing another vehicle or bicyclist, <br/>+*when approaching a place where right (left in England) turns are authorized in order to increase visibility and predictability, and to prevent motorists making unsafe turns across the bicyclist's path, <br/>+*or whenever the cyclist feels it increases his safety. <br/>+Vehicular cycling, including using the full lane when appropriate, is supported by traffic laws in most countries (California's Vehicle Code section 21202 is an example of this).<br/> <br/>-Separate House and Senate investigations were further delayed until 1992. [[William Casey]], the alleged go-between, was dead by then, and it seemed impossible to account for all his moves during the summer of 1980, when he is said to have conferred with agents representing the Ayatollah Khomeini's government. <br/>+==Destination and Speed Positioning==<br/> <br/>-If the allegations are true, some believe that dealing with a hostile foreign government to achieve the defeat of a domestic administration would have been an act of [[treason]].<br/>+Vehicle drivers and cyclists who are traveling in accordance to the vehicular rules of the road use '''speed positioning''' between intersections.  That is, drivers of slower vehicles generally operate in the rightmost (leftmost in England) lane, and ''when width allows'', even keep far enough to the side to allow faster traffic to share the rightmost lane.<br/> <br/>-According to Sick's theory, [[Oliver North]] was the administration's scapegoat, taking responsibility in order to conceal the "treason" of Reagan and Bush. A [[PBS]] documentary, "The Secret Government," hosted by Bill Moyers, detailed the "off the shelf, self-financing, independent covert operations" entity mentioned by North, and tracing it to its cold war beginnings won an [[Emmy]] for best documentary film.<br/>+As a driver approaches an intersection, '''destination positioning''' comes into play.  Here, drivers of slow vehicles choose the rightmost (leftmost in England) lane that serves their destination.  For example, if the rightmost lane is right-only, drivers (who are not turning right) merge left into the adjacent lane.  Also, lane position for drivers of narrow vehicles (like motorcycles as well as bicycles) is also dictated by destination.  For example, in a lane that serves destinations to the left, straight and right, a cyclist would travel along the left side if going left, along the right side if going right, and in between if going straight.  In a lane that goes straight or right, the cyclist's position within the lane should be reflected by his destination.  However, when turning, a narrow vehicle driver should be careful to not move so far to the side so as to invite other drivers to squeeze in next to him within the lane during the turn.<br/> <br/>-==See also==<br/>-* [[George Bush family conspiracy theory]]<br/>-* [[Iran-Contra]]<br/>-* [[Iran hostage crisis]]<br/>-The issue of an October Surprise first came to light during an investigation by a House of Representatives Subcommittee into how the 1980 Reagan Campaign obtained debate briefing materials of then President Carter.  During the investigation, the Subcommittee on Human Resources of the House Post Office and Civil Service Committee obtained access to Reagan Campaign documents and discovered numerous instances of documents and memorandum referencing a monitoring effort for any such October Surprise.  The Subcommittee, Chaired by former US Rep. Donald Albosta (D-MI) issued a comprehensive report in 1984 describing each type of information that was detected and its possible source.  There is a section in the report dedicated to the October Surprise issue.<br/>+Vehicular Cycling experts recommend that, and the laws generally allow for, cyclists to establish the center of the lane (between the left and right tracks of cars) as their ''default'' or ''primary riding position'' when there is no reason to ride in the ''secondary riding position'' close to the edge of the roadway (i.e., when faster same-direction is present, wants to pass, and it is safe and reasonable to move into the ''secondary riding position'').  In general, like motorcyclists, bicyclists are much more visible and predictable in the ''primary riding position'' (and, hence, less likely to be not seen or not noticed) than when they are riding closer to the edge of the roadway.<br/>+<br/>+==Looking Back==<br/>+<br/>+The trivial sounding skill of ''looking back'' over one's shoulder is critical to vehicular cycling.  It's not as easy to perform as it may sound because it requires traveling in a straight line while looking behind for up to a few seconds, and requires some practice to master.  The natural tendency is to not continue in a straight line, but to swerve in the direction one is looking.<br/>+<br/>+''Looking back'' is essential whenever a cyclist needs to move laterally on the roadway for two reasons: 1) to make sure that he will not be moving in front of someone else, or violating another's [[right-of-way]], and 2) to communicate to others that he plans on moving.  Cycling experts contend that simply ''looking back'' often suffices as a signal to others that a cyclist wishes to move laterally in the direction he turned his head, and that a hand signal is often not required (this is important because using hand signals requires the cyclist to remove one hand from the handlebars, which is not desireable in many situations).  Most [[Effective Cycling]] students confirm that they are surprised to learn how quickly motorists often yield the right-of-way when they try the ''look back'' signaling technique for the first time.<br/>+<br/>+==Negotiation==<br/>+Many cycling experts explain the concept of '''negotiation''', and its role in traffic cycling vehicularly, when merging across multiple lanes of traffic.  The basic idea is to gain control of one lane at a time, and ''negotiate'' for the [[right of way]] in the adjacent lane before moving into and controlling it.  This is an important ''vehicular cycling'' skill because it alleviates the cyclist from having to execute a pedestrian style left turn, which involves switching modes to pedestrian and then back to vehicular again.  <br/>+<br/>+The first step in merging across multiple lanes involves merging (after ''looking back'') to ''use the full lane''.  Once control of the outside lane has been established, the cyclist moves towards the inside of the lane, signalling his intent to merge into the adjacent lane.  Often simply ''looking back'' is all that is required to signal this intent, but sometimes the cyclist must use a hand signal to coax a passing motorist to slow down and yield the [[right-of-way]] to let him in.  Once right-of-way is established in the adjacent lane, the cyclist moves in, [[using the full lane]], and repeats the process until he reaches his destination lane (from which his turn is allowed).  The key to the process is that the cyclist is never cycling in front of someone who has not explicitly yielded the [[right-of-way]] to him.<br/>+<br/>+==The VC Attitude==<br/>+In the end, VC is as much about attitude as anything else.  Without the VC attitude, no matter the skills, one cannot ride in traffic vehicularly.  One really must believe, deep down, that as a cyclist he is a vehicle driver -- that he has the same rights as other vehicle drivers and that it is safe and not discourteous to assert those rights -- before he can act as a vehicle driver. Acting as a vehicle driver is a critical prerequisite to being treated as one (if one does not act as a vehicle driver, he certainly won't be treated as one).<br/>+<br/>+==Misconceptions About VC==<br/>+There is considerable confusion expressed on the internet about the meaning of '''vehicular cycling'''.  Some people mistakenly describe '''VC''' as, "cycling as if you're a car".  But bicycles are not cars, and the vehicular rules of the road apply to not just cars, but all kinds of vehicles, from [[horse and buggy|horse and buggies]] to [[tractor trailer]]s, and everything in between, including bicycles.   Some rules have more relevance to drivers of some vehicles than to others because of unique physical and operational characteristics of some vehicles.  For example, because of the narrow nature of motorcycles, motorcyclists can often share (split) lanes that are too narrow for two standard width vehicles to share.   This is also true for bicyclists, whose vehicles also have the narrow characteristic.  Truck drivers require special training, as do bus and taxi drivers, and motorcyclists.  Some people advocate special training for cyclists to learn '''vehicular cycling''', such as the [[Effective Cycling]] program.  One of the main vehicular rules that has special application to cyclists riding on roadways is that drivers of slower vehicles should keep to the side (when safe and reasonable) ''between intersections'', though many people forget that ''at intersections and their approaches'' lane position should be selected according to destination.  Cyclists who ride in the center of a lane needlessly impeding faster traffic are sometimes mistakenly referred to as ''vehicular cyclists''; yet by definition a cyclist who ''needlessly'' impedes faster traffic is violating the vehicular rules of the road and is hence '''not''' riding vehicularly.  Another misconception about VC -- that riding in [[bike lane]]s is non-vehicular -- probably stems from an opposition to bike lanes by [[John Forester]]. Nevertheless, Forester himself has written and said on numerous occasions that riding vehicularly often involves riding in bike lanes, particularly when the facility happens to represent the most appropriate place to cycle for the given circumstance and conditions.  So VC does not require staying out of bike lanes all the time.<br/>+<br/>+==VC Authoritative Sources==<br/>+Forester's book, [[Effective Cycling]], is generally considered the primary reference on '''vehicular cycling'''.<br/>+<br/>+Without using the term '''vehicular cycling''' ''per se'', John Franklin does an excellent job describing the philosophy in his book, '''Cyclecraft'''.  He too advocates cycling in accordance to the vehicular rules of the road.  Using terms such as '''primary riding position''' &#151; meaning in the center of the traffic lane &#151; and '''secondary riding position''' &#151; meaning about 1 meter (3 feet) to the side of moving traffic, but not closer than .5 meters (1.5 feet) to the edge of the road, Franklin advocates the '''primary riding position''' as the normal position and the '''secondary riding position''' only when safe and reasonable to allow faster traffic to pass.<br/>+<br/>+Another source for education regarding the basics of '''vehicular cycling''' is John S. Allen's pamphlet, '''Bicycling Street Smarts''', available for free on his website (see below).<br/>+<br/>+Still more descriptions of '''vehicular cycling''' can be found by following the [[Vehicular_cycling#References|links below]].<br/>+<br/>+==VC Alternatives==<br/>+An alternative to '''vehicular cycling''' is ''pedestrian cycling'', or cycling according to the pedestrian rules of the road.  This means riding on sidewalks, crosswalks and paths at pedestrian speeds. It is important to be aware that the use of footpaths or sidewalks by cyclists is forbidden in many countries.  In addition, where such activities are illegal, cyclists may be held totally liable for any injuries to other parties or damage to property resulting from such behaviour.  Cycling experts contend that while ''pedestrian cycling'' can be accomplished safely, one should be aware of the peculiar hazards associated with this activity, including but not limited to:<br/>+* Opening passenger-side doors.<br/>+* Pedestrians, dogs, children playing, etc.<br/>+* Potential conflicts with other vehicles at all intersections, including driveways and alleys as well as major intersections.<br/>+* Entering crosswalks, where drivers turning into your path are often looking the other way.<br/>+<br/>+Some cyclists routinely operate not in accordance with either the vehicular or pedestrian system.  Car-bike collision statistics indicate that such cyclists are particularly vulnerable.<br/>+<br/>+Many cyclists use a combination of vehicular and pedestrian cycling.  This approach has the drawback that extra care must be taken when transitioning from one mode to the other, since transitioning often leads to actions not expected by others.  In particular, during a transition, a cyclist must yield the right-of-way to both pedestrians and vehicle drivers.<br/>+<br/>+==VC Education==<br/>+Besides VC self-education from studying books, one may be trained in ''vehicular cycling'' by taking courses from organizations like the [[League of American Bicyclists]] and Can-Bike.<br/>+<br/>+==VC Advocacy==<br/>+Advocates of '''vehicular cycling''', like Forester, Franklin and Allen, argue that cycling in accordance to the vehicular rules of the road is the safest and most effective means to use a bicycle for transportation.<br/>+<br/>+Some VC advocates contend that cyclists should only ride vehicularly, believing that non-vehicular cycling is not only less safe, but leads to less societal acceptance of cyclists who do cycle vehicularly.<br/>+<br/>+Some VC advocates oppose [[Segregated_cycle_facilities|segregated cycling facilities]] like [[bike lane debate|bike lanes]] because they inhibit and discourage cycling integrated with other vehicular traffic.<br/>+<br/>+==See Also==<br/>+* [[effective cycling]]<br/>+* [[bike lane debate]]<br/>+<br/>+==Bibliography==<br/>+* ''Effective Cycling'' by John Forester (First edition, 1976; Sixth edition, The MIT Press, 1993) ISBN 0262560704<br/>+* ''Cyclecraft'' by John Franklin (First edition, Stationery Office Books, 1999) ISBN 0117020516<br/> <br/> ==References==<br/>-*[[Abbie Hoffman]] and Johnathan Silvers, "An election held hostage," ''Playboy Magazine'', October 1988<br/>-*Barbara Honegger, 1989.

Taylor after the 1907 season, is based on an obsolete form of the word "[[sock]]s", as in the red footwear worn by the team starting in 1908. The older [[Atlanta Braves|Boston National League club]] had originally been called the ''Red Stockings'', and in fact had worn red stockings until temporarily abandoning them in 1907, which inspired the American League club owner to grab the nickname. Prior to 1908, the A.L. team in fact wore ''dark blue'' stockings, and did not have an official nickname. They were simply "the Bostons" or "the Boston Baseball club"; some newspaper writers referred to them as the Boston "Americans" (as in "American Leaguers", Boston being a two-team city) or "Somersets" (for a one-time club owner), but these were unofficial names. The team was ''never'' known as either the Boston "Pilgrims" or "Puritans". Those names were invented years later by historical revisionists.<br/>+:'''Current ownership:''' John Henry and Tom Werner, who paid $660 million and assumed $400 million in debt, in February [[2002]].

Photo: ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' archives.]]<br/>+The Red Sox were owned by [[Joseph Lannin]] from [[1913]] to [[1916]] and he signed [[Babe Ruth]], commonly seen as the best player in baseball history. In [[1919]], the team's new owner, [[Harry Frazee]], sold Ruth to the [[New York Yankees]]. Legend has it that he did so in order to finance a [[Broadway]] play ''[[No, No Nanette]]'' starring 'a friend', but in actual fact the play did not open on Broadway until [[1925]]. Rather, Frazee sold Ruth mostly because he was a serious disciplinary problem (and continued to be one in New York) and because although Ruth was a ''star'', it was not necessarily apparent that he would become the ''superstar'' player he quickly became in New York. The contract was a straight sale; the Red Sox got no players in return. Frazee also unloaded a number of other Hall of Fame quality players to the Yankees for other reasons. [[Carl Mays]] quit the team in mid-game and refused to return; his trade was essentially a salvage operation. Other Frazee era players went to New York as part of Frazee's financial strategy after he decided to leave baseball, having been driven out by Ban Johnson, including [[Sad Sam Jones]] and [[Waite Hoyt]]. These players (some of them Hall of Fame members) formed the nucleus of the first championship Yankee teams of the 1920s.<br/>+<br/>+===[[Tom Yawkey]] and [[Ted Williams]]===<br/>+[[Image:Tedwilliams and tomyawkey.jpg|left|frame|Ted Williams & Tom Yawkey]]<br/>+In [[1933]], a wealthy, shy young man named Tom Yawkey bought the Red Sox and began pumping money into the team.<br/>+<br/>+In [[1939]], the Red Sox purchased the contract of [[outfielder]] Ted Williams, then playing in the [[Pacific Coast League]], ushering in an era of the team sometimes called the "Ted Sox".  Williams was perhaps the most obsessive hitter in baseball history, and is generally considered the greatest hitter of all time, being able to hit for both power and average.  Stories of his being able to hold a bat in his hand and correctly estimate its weight down to the ounce have floated around baseball circles for decades.  ''Science of Hitting'',  his book on the subject, is considered by some as a bible of hitting theory and science.   He is also the last player to hit over .400 for a full season, in [[1941]].<br/>+<br/>+With Williams, the Red Sox went to the World Series in [[1946]], but lost to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], in part because of the use of the "Williams Shift", in which the shortstop would move to the right side of the infield to make it harder for the left-handed-hitting Williams to hit to that side of the field.  Some have claimed that Williams was too proud to hit to the other side of the field, not wanting to let the Cardinals take away his game.  He did not hit well in the Series, gathering only five singles in 25 at-bats, for a .200 average.  However, this was also likely influenced by an elbow injury he had received a few days before when he was hit by a pitch in an exhibition game.<br/>+<br/>+The Red Sox featured several other very good players during the [[1940s]], including SS [[Johnny Pesky]] (for whom the right field foul pole in Fenway - "Pesky's Pole" - is named), 2B [[Bobby Doerr]], and CF [[Dom DiMaggio]] (brother of [[Joe DiMaggio|Joe]]).  Despite this, they lost the pennant by one game in each of [[1948]] and [[1949]], and Williams never played in another World Series.<br/>+<br/>+The [[1950s]] were a lean time for the Red Sox.  After Williams returned from the [[Korean War]], many of the best players from the late [[1940s]] had retired or been traded.  The stark contrast in the team led critics to call the Red Sox daily lineup "Ted Williams and the Seven Dwarfs".  Also, unlike many other teams, they refused to sign black players, even passing up a chance at future Hall-of-Famers [[Jackie Robinson]] and [[Willie Mays]], both of who tried out for Boston and were highly praised by team scouts. Ted Williams hit .388 at the age of 38 in [[1957]], but there was little else for Boston fans to root for.  Williams retired at the end of the [[1960]] season, famously hitting a home run in his final at-bat. The Sox finally became the last Major League team to sign an [[African American]] player when they signed modest [[infield|infielder]] [[Pumpsie Green]] in [[1959]].  <br/>+<br/>+Supposedly the right-field bullpens in Fenway Park were built in part for Williams' left-handed swing, and these are sometimes called "Williamsburg".<br/>+<br/>+===[[Carl Yastrzemski|Carl "Yaz" Yastrzemski]]===<br/>+[[Image:Carl yastrzemski.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Carl "Yaz" Yastrzemski]]<br/>+The [[1960s]] also started poorly for the Red Sox, though [[1961]] saw the debut of Carl Yastrzemski ("Yaz"), who would become one of the best hitters of the pitching-rich decade.<br/>+<br/>+Red Sox fans remember [[1967]] as the year of the "Impossible Dream."  The team had finished the [[1966]] season in ninth place, but they found new life with Yaz leading the team to the World Series.  Yaz won the American League [[Triple crown (baseball)|Triple Crown]] and put on one of the greatest displays of hitting down the stretch in baseball history.  But the Red Sox lost the series  - again to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]].  The 1967 season is remembered as one of the great pennant races in baseball history since four teams were in the AL pennant race until almost the last game.<br/>+<br/>+The Sox won the AL pennant in [[1975]], with Yaz surrounded by other stars such as rookie outfielders [[Jim Rice]] and [[Fred Lynn]] (who won both the AL [[MLB Rookie of the Year award|Rookie of the Year]] and [[MLB Most Valuable Player award|MVP]] awards), veteran outfielder [[Dwight Evans]], catcher [[Carlton Fisk]], and pitchers [[Luis Tiant]] and the eccentric junkballer [[Bill Lee]].<br/>+<br/>+Game 6 of the [[1975 World Series]], against the [[Cincinnati Reds]]' so-called "Big Red Machine," is regarded by some as the greatest game in baseball postseason history, an extra-inning drama featuring dramatic home runs by [[Bernie Carbo]] and Fisk (the latter a game-winner, the famous 'body English' homerun). Despite the series-tying win, the Red Sox lost Game 7, and this time it would be Yaz who never again played in a World Series.<br/>+<br/>+The Red Sox may have lost to the National League champions in the World Series, but their true rivals were the [[New York Yankees]], who after the Babe Ruth trade in 1919 would go on to win 26 World Series championships.  The race for the pennant often came to a close competition between the Red Sox and the Yankees.  The Red Sox-Yankees rivalry came to a head in the [[1978]] season, when the two clubs finished the regular season in a tie for the American League East division title.  A winner-take-all playoff game was held at Fenway Park.  The Yankees drove a stake through the hearts of Red Sox fans when [[Bucky Dent]] drove a game-winning home run over the [[Green Monster]].<br/>+<br/>+===The "[[Curse of the Bambino]]"===<br/>+[[Image:Babe_Ruth_Red_Sox.JPEG|thumb|225px|left|Babe Ruth, as a young pitcher for the Red Sox]]<br/>+<br/>+===After the Yawkeys===<br/>+<br/>+Tom Yawkey had passed away in [[1976]], and his wife [[Jean R.

Duquette's reign began with promises to revive the flagging Sox [[minor league baseball|farm system]], but ended with several huge contracts to major stars and a great deal of public acrimony.  The fans and local media often turned on the players; general managers humiliated the manager; managers and players sniped at each other.<br/>+<br/>+In the strike-shortened [[1995]] season, the Sox won the newly-realigned [[American League East]], finishing 7 games ahead of the rival Yankees. Once again, they were swept, this time 3-0 by the [[Cleveland Indians]], running their postseason losing streak to 13 games, dating back to the 1986 World Series.<br/>+<br/>+In [[1998]] the Red Sox traded for Expos star pitcher [[Pedro Martínez]], and signed him to a long-term contract. Martinez would have several spectacular seasons for the Red Sox. In 1998 they won the wild card, but again lost the [[American League Division Series]] to the Indians, this time 3-1, despite winning Game 1 11-3 behind Martinez. <br/>+<br/>+In [[1999]] they got revenge on the Indians. Cleveland took a 2-0 series lead, but the Red Sox won Game 3 9-3 behind the pitching of [[Ramón Martínez (baseball pitcher)|Ramón Martínez]], Pedro's brother, and [[Derek Lowe]]. Game 4 was a blowout 23-7 win for the Red Sox and the highest scoring playoff game in history. Game 5 was a tense affair, with the Indians taking a 5-2 lead after two innings, but Pedro Martínez, nursing a shoulder injury, came on in the fourth inning and pitched six innings of no-hit ball while the offense rallied for a 12-8 win, behind two home runs from [[Troy O'Leary]]. The Red Sox then met the 26 Time World Champion [[New York Yankees]] and lost 4 games to 1. <br/>+<br/>+The Duquette era ended in [[2002]], when president and Yawkey trustee John Harrington sold the Red Sox to a consortium comprising [[John Henry (baseball)|John Henry]], Tom Werner, and Les Otten, with [[Larry Lucchino]] as president and CEO. Duquette was fired, and replaced for the 2002 season by Mike Port. After almost hiring [[Oakland Athletics|Oakland]]'s [[Billy Beane]] during the 2002 off-season, the Red Sox promoted [[Yale University|Yale]] graduate [[Theo Epstein]] to general manager. At 28, he became the youngest GM in the history of the Major Leagues.<br/>+<br/>+[[June 27]], [[2003]], the Red Sox established a new Major League Baseball record by scoring 10 runs against the [[Florida Marlins]] before the Marlins could get an out in the first inning. <br/>+<br/>+The [[2003]] postseason delivered another blow to Red Sox fans.  The Sox rallied from a 2-0 deficit against the [[Oakland Athletics]] to win the best-of-5  American League Division Series.  They then faced the Yankees in the [[2003 American League Championship Series]]. In the deciding Game 7, Boston had a 5-2 lead over the Yankees in the 8th inning, but Pedro Martínez allowed three runs to tie the game, and the Red Sox lost the game 6-5 in 11 innings, on a home run by Yankee [[third baseman]] [[Aaron Boone]]. Many Red Sox fans blamed the loss on their manager, [[Grady Little]], for not removing Martínez after seven strong innings, when he began to show signs of tiring.  Most Red Sox fans saw this as the culmination of two years of questionable decisionmaking by Little, and it was the "straw that broke the camel's back" which led to him not being brought back the following offseason. He was replaced by [[Terry Francona]], a man who finally brought Boston a championship for the first time in 86 years. It took them awhile.<br/>+<br/>+===2004: A New Era===<br/>+During the offseason, the Red Sox acquired another ace pitcher in [[Curt Schilling]] and almost landed [[shortstop]] [[Alex Rodriguez]], but the deal fell through, and Rodriguez went to the Yankees instead. Nevertheless, the Red Sox were picked by many to win the American League East in [[2004]]. In seven meetings with New York in April, the Sox lost just one, and opened up a 4-game lead early in the season. Through midseason, the team struggled mightily, and fell more than 10 games behind New York. Management shook up the team at the MLB trading deadline on July 31 by trading shortstop [[Nomar Garciaparra]] to the [[Chicago Cubs]] in exchange for [[Orlando Cabrera]] of the [[Montreal Expos]] and [[Doug Mientkiewicz]] of the [[Minnesota Twins]] in a four-team deal. Also acquired, though less publicized, was speedy outfielder [[Dave Roberts]] of the [[LA Dodgers]] for minor league prospects. After splitting six games with the Yankees in September, the Red Sox remained in contention, but finished three games back in the AL East, again qualifying as the AL Wild Card.<br/>+<br/>+The playoffs started with a bang as the Red Sox swept the AL West champion [[Anaheim Angels]], winning Game 3 by a score of 8-6 on [[David Ortiz]]'s 10th inning [[walk-off home run]] over the [[Green Monster]]. The Red Sox thus advanced to a rematch in the [[2004 American League Championship Series]] against their bitter rivals: the [[New York Yankees]].  <br/>+<br/>+In Game 1, the Red Sox didn't have a hit until the seventh, and lost 10-7. Worse, Schilling left early in the game due to an ankle injury suffered in the Anaheim series. Pedro started Game 2 and pitched effectively, but the team lost 3-1 because of an unexpected pitching gem by [[Jon Lieber]]. In Game 3, the Red Sox were demolished 19-8, a game which set the record for most runs scored by both teams in a League Championship Series, to fall behind 3-0 in the series. In Game 4 of the playoff, down 4-3 in the ninth with Yankees closer [[Mariano Rivera]] on the mound, the Sox rallied thanks to a stolen base by Roberts, an [[Run batted in|RBI]] single by [[Bill Mueller]] and Ortiz's 2-run [[walk-off home run]] in the 12th inning to win the game 6-4. Again trailing the next night, the Sox again rallied, and in the 14th inning, Ortiz's RBI single won the game 5-4. Game 5 set a record for longest postseason game in terms of time (5 hours and 49 minutes) and for longest ALCS game (14 innings).  The Red Sox rally continued through Game 6, in which Schilling returned to pitch seven innings on an ankle held that had three sutures wrapped in a bloody, literally red sock, and into Game 7, when [[Johnny Damon]] (who affectionately referred to the team as "The Idiots" to describe its eclectic roster) hit a [[grand slam]] in the second inning and added another home run later. The Sox rolled 10-3 to win the series 4-3. <br/>+<br/>+They became the first team in baseball history (and the third in North American professional sports history, after the 1942 [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] and the 1975 [[New York Islanders]] of the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]) to rally from a 3-0 deficit to win a best-of-7 series. Neither of those teams had trailed in game four of their series, and the nature of the game is very different. Team sports such as hockey and basketball can have the same lineup in every game, and turning around a 3-0 deficit does not seem quite so insurmountable, although it is obvioulsy rare. In baseball, the lineup is not only different every day due to the change of pitchers, but also the same batters have to adjust to a different pitcher. The old theory was that a comeback from 3-0 was virtually impossible, because one of the pitchers that beat them in the first 3 games would likely beat them again. The new theory is that the old theory was flawed, perhaps because it was based on the notion of a dominant starter. In the modern game, starters seldom pitch a full game, especially in the critical post-season.<br/>+<br/>+The Red Sox comeback against the Yankees is generally regarded as the greatest comeback in North American sports history.  Conversely, it is also viewed as one of the worst team breakdowns in sports history, not just due to the Yankees' 3-0 series lead, but also because the Yankees have long been the greatest and most feared franchise in the sport.  The Yankees fielded a very capable team in 2004, winning the AL East with the largest total payroll in baseball, and after the season, they were not perceived as a "Cinderella" team whose carriage finally turned into a pumpkin, but rather an overpaid, arrogant and aging group of athletes who suffered an ignominious collapse at the hands of a bitter rival.  One writer, following the ALCS, predicted that this collapse would hang over this franchise for a long time.  Whether that proves to be true, or whether this proves to be merely another event in the two teams' century-old rivalry, will depend on the outcome of the 2005 season and later seasons.<br/>+<br/>+David Ortiz was named MVP of the ALCS.  Unfortunately the end of Game 7 did not go without [[2004_American_League_Championship_Series#The_post_game_riots|rioting]] in the streets of Boston.  An investigation by the city of Boston later found the [[police]] were largely at fault for the incident due to their use of improper crowd control techniques.<br/>+<br/>+The Red Sox moved on to the [[2004 World Series]] against the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], a team that had posted the best record in the major leagues winning 105 games on the season -- and the team that had defeated the Red Sox in the 1946 and 1967 World Series. Game 1 set a new record for the highest scoring World Series opening game (breaking the previous record set in 1932). Toward the end of the game, [[Manny Ramirez]] committed two errors, allowing St. Louis to tie the game. However, he was saved by second baseman [[Mark Bellhorn]], who hit the eventual game-winning two-run homer. The Sox defeated the Cardinals twice in Boston and twice in St. Louis to sweep the World Series, making this their first Series win since 1918. The final out of the game was made on Cardinals shortstop [[Edgar Rentería]] at 11:40 pm, in the midst of a [[lunar eclipse]].  [[Joe Castiglione]], a longtime radio broadcaster for the Red Sox, narrated, "Foulke to the set, the 1-0 pitch, here it is, swing and a ground ball stabbed by Foulke, he has it, he underhands to first, and the Boston Red Sox are the World Champions!  For the first time in 86 years, the Red Sox have won baseball's World Championship!  Can you believe it?" <br/>+<br/>+The Red Sox held a parade &ndash; or as Boston mayor [[Thomas Menino]] put it, a "rolling rally" &ndash; on [[Saturday]], [[October 30]], [[2004]]. A crowd of more than 3 million members of "Red Sox Nation" filled the streets of Boston to cheer as the team rode [[DUKW|Duck Tours]].<br/>+<br/>+The Red Sox were chosen by ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' as that magazine's [[Sportsman of the Year|Sportsmen of the Year]].  They are the first professional sports team to be chosen, and the only other teams to be chosen were the 1999 U.S. Women's soccer team and the 1980 'Miracle on Ice' U.S. Olympic hockey team.<br/>+<br/>+===The 2005 Season===<br/>+<br/>+The '''2005 Boston Red Sox season''' comes on the heels of their 2004 World Series championship.  Not only did the Red Sox win the series after a decades-long drought by sweeping the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in four games, they beat the [[New York Yankees]] four games to three in the [[ALCS]] after losing the first three games.  No baseball team in history had ever pulled off such a comeback.  In preseason polls the Sox were picked first or second in the league, along with the Yankees.<br/>+<br/>+====2005 Schedule====<br/>+<br/>+[[Major League Baseball]] has weighted Boston's schedule slightly, in line with its post-season success in 2004.  The schedule is created with the assistance of detailed forecasts of each team's relative success in the 2005 season, which are partially independent of the results of the 2004 season.  The weighting in the Bosox' schedule can be seen in Major League ball's choice of Atlanta and St. Louis as interleague foes, and also perhaps in the numbers in the non-divisional list below.<br/>+<br/>+====Home Division====<br/>+<br/>+In their division, the [[AL East]], the Red Sox have the following games:<br/>+<br/>+* [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] -19-<br/>+* New York Yankees

Phillies]] -3-<br/>+<br/>+for 3 games apiece giving 18 IL games.<br/>+<br/>+====American League====<br/>+<br/>+In non-divisional league play the Red Sox have at least 6 games against each AL

The most public face of the story is that in October 1980, an agreement was reached, after long negotiations, to unfreeze Iran's monetary assets for the safe return of the hostages - but not until after Reagan's inauguration on January 20, 1981. In the event, the hostages were released minutes after Reagan was sworn in as President.<br/>+Under the international [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]] (1968), a bicycle (or "cycle", as referenced by the convention) is defined to be a ''vehicle'' and a cyclist is considered to be a ''driver''.  In some jurisdictions, a bicycle is defined as a "device" rather than a vehicle, but in those cases usually the operator of a bicycle is afforded the "same rights and responsibilities" as a driver of a vehicle.  Often, cyclists are allowed additional privileges that motor vehicle drivers are not &#151; such as traveling on sidewalks in accordance to the pedestrian rules of the road. (Care must be taken with respect to this allowance as some jurisdictions do not permit sidewalk cycling; consult your local ordinances before practicing.) '''Vehicular cycling''' (VC), is riding a bicycle on roadways in accordance with the vehicular [[rules of the road]]. Sometimes '''vehicular cycling''' is referred to as '''integrated cycling''' (i.e. ''integrated'' with other vehicular traffic, as opposed to cycling in [[segregated cycle facilities|''segregated cycling facilities'']] ), '''cooperative cycling''', or '''bicycle driving'''.<br/> <br/>-The 1980 Reagan team spoke openly of their fear of an "October surprise" and had "reason to believe" [http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/library/congress/1992_cr/h920205-october-clips.htm] as [[Gary Sick]] has said, that the Carter administration would attempt another hostage rescue shortly before the election.  This was amply reported in the [[Wall Street Journal]] and other organizations contemporaneously to the event.<br/>+A ''vehicular/integrated/cooperative cyclist'', or ''bicycle driver'', is a cyclist who generally rides on roadways in accordance to the ''vehicular'' [[rules of the road]].  Primarily, this means:<br/> <br/>-The phrase "October surprise" also refers to any last minute trick by a party to sway an election, as US elections are traditionally held at the beginning of November.<br/>+* Riding on the same side of the road as other vehicular traffic.<br/>+* Riding outside of the [[door zone]]; no closer than five feet to parked cars.<br/>+* Obeying traffic controls (like stop signs and traffic signals).<br/>+* Choosing the appropriate lane and lateral lane position according to '''speed positioning''' between intersections.<br/>+* Choosing the appropriate lane and lateral lane position according to '''destination positioning''' at intersections and their approaches, including merging away from the side of the road before going straight across an intersection.<br/>+* Adjusting lateral lane position (moving left and right) relatively often in response to, and in anticipation of, ever-changing conditions and factors.<br/>+* '''Using the full lane''' when appropriate.<br/>+* Merging, one lane at a time, across a roadway to get to a turn lane, using '''negotiation''' with other drivers as required.<br/>+* Generally feeling and acting like a vehicle driver, albeit the driver of a narrow and relatively low-powered vehicle.<br/> <br/>-==Details==<br/>-Proponents of the theory, such as Barbara Honegger, a researcher and policy analyst with the 1980 Reagan/Bush campaign (interviewed in link), allege that [[William Casey]] and other representatives of the Reagan presidential campaign made a deal at two sets of meetings in July and August at the Ritz Hotel in Madrid with Iranians to delay the release of Americans held hostage in Iran until after the November 1980 presidential elections. The idea was that Reagan's opponent, the incumbent President Jimmy Carter, whose team had been negotiating, wouldn't gain a popularity boost (an 'October Surprise') before election day. The allegations included a date-specific allegation that William Casey met with an Iranian cleric in Madrid, Spain, and much of the tardy investigations have centered on whether, at the weekend in question he was actually at a [[Bohemian Grove]] retreat in California. Though William Casey was probably in London following the alleged meetings, critical pages of his daybook diary were unaccountably missing when the investigators came to look for them over a decade later.<br/>+While any cyclist riding on the roadway is bound to be riding "vehicularly" at least some of the time, few cyclists actually ride vehicularly consistently.  Some non-vehicular actions commonly taken by cyclists include:<br/>+* Cycling on the wrong side of the road.<br/>+* Cycling in the [[door zone]].<br/>+* Cycling on sidewalks or in crosswalks.<br/>+* Running stop signs.<br/>+* Running red lights.<br/>+* Going straight across an intersection from the side of the road from which right (left in England) turns are allowed and expected, and through travel is not expected.<br/>+* Turning left (right in England) from the side of the road and darting across the roadway, instead of merging across one lane at a time.<br/>+* Moving laterally without looking back over the shoulder.<br/>+* Stopping or cycling on stripes separating lanes instead of taking an assertive position within a lane.<br/>+* At red lights, moving to the front of traffic and stopping in the crosswalk or ahead of the stop line, instead of taking one's place in line according to the '''first come, first served''' principle.<br/>+* Passing slow or stopped traffic on the right (left in England).<br/>+* Cycling in the gutter or generally keep to the side, even when there is no same-direction faster traffic present.<br/>+* Cycling on the side of a lane that is too narrow to be safely shared side by side with other vehicles, thus inviting drivers of vehicles to try to squeeze into the narrow lane unsafely.<br/> <br/>-Carter was at the time dealing with the [[Iran hostage crisis]] and the hostile regime of the [[Ayatollah Khomeini]]. Those who assert that a deal was made allege that certain Republicans with [[CIA]] connections, including [[George H. W. Bush]], arranged to have the hostages held through October, until Reagan could defeat Carter in early November, and then be released.  The hostages were in fact released on the very day of Reagan's inauguration, twenty minutes after his inaugural address.<br/> <br/>-Two months earlier, in a campaigning interview, Ronald Reagan had said that he had a "secret plan" involving the hostages. "My ideas require quiet diplomacy," he had responded when pressed, "where you don't have to say what it is you're thinking of doing."<br/>+==Origins of Vehicular Cycling==<br/> <br/>-A 1981 Congressional probe into the Reagan campaign's theft of White House briefing books on the eve of a presidential debate disclosed that Reagan campaign manager William Casey (later appointed as  [[Director of Central Intelligence]] in the Reagan administration) was receiving highly classified reports on closely-held Carter administration intelligence on the Carter campaign and the Democratic president's efforts to liberate the hostages.<br/>+The origins of vehicular cycling go back to the 19th century when bicycles were invented and shared the roads with horses and buggies.  Cyclists have been riding in accordance to the vehicular rules of the road ever since.<br/> <br/>-===Chronology===<br/>-Chronology:<br/>+==Using the full lane==<br/> <br/>-* Sep. 22 (1980): Iraq invades Iran. <br/>-* Oct. 15-20: Meetings are held in Paris between emissaries of the Reagan-Bush campaign, with Mr. Casey as "key participant," and "high-level Iranian and Israeli representatives."<br/>-* Oct. 21: Iran, for reasons not explained, abruptly shifts its position in secret negotiations with the Carter administration and disclaims "further interest in receiving military equipment."<br/>-* Oct. 21-23: Israel secretly ships F-4 fighter-aircraft tires to Iran, in violation of the U.S. arms embargo, and Iran disperses the hostages to different locations.<br/>+Using the full lane, sometimes referred to as "taking the lane", is a vehicular cycling technique whereby a bicyclist commands full use of the lane instead of operating at its side. Riding at the side yields the right-of-way in the remainder of the lane, and enables motorists to use it, which sometimes is not safe or desired for the given circumstances. Using the full lane precludes sharing the lane simultaneously side-by-side with drivers of other vehicles. Experienced cyclists commonly use the full lane under the following circumstances:<br/> <br/>-==Investigations==<br/>-A [[PBS]] '[[Frontline]]' documentary in 1990 brought a sound bite unavoidably to the surface in detail, as did a [[15 April]] 1991 ''[[New York Times]]'' article by Gary Sick. In 1991, while playing golf with George Bush in Palm Springs, Ronald Reagan gave reporters a sound bite. In 1980, he had "tried some things the other way," that is, to free the hostages, he told them. When pressed he said that the details remained "classified."  The remark was widely publicized  and linked to Reagan's 1980 campaign remark undisclosed "secret plan" to free the hostages, with the unanswered question of how a Presidential candidate in 1980 had received "classified" information [http://www.carpenoctem.tv/cons/october.html].  <br/>+*When there is no other traffic moving in the same direction at the time, to increase visibility to any potential oncoming turning traffic and cross-traffic to prevent unsafe turns across the cyclist's path, and also to increase conspicuity for traffic approaching from the rear, <br/>+*when traveling at the normal speed of traffic moving in the same direction at that time, <br/>+*when the lane is too narrow for a bicycle and a vehicle to travel safely side by side within the lane, <br/>+*when merging across a roadway in preparation for a turn across the opposing lanes, <br/>+*when overtaking or passing another vehicle or bicyclist, <br/>+*when approaching a place where right (left in England) turns are authorized in order to increase visibility and predictability, and to prevent motorists making unsafe turns across the bicyclist's path, <br/>+*or whenever the cyclist feels it increases his safety. <br/>+Vehicular cycling, including using the full lane when appropriate, is supported by traffic laws in most countries (California's Vehicle Code section 21202 is an example of this).<br/> <br/>-Separate House and Senate investigations were further delayed until 1992. [[William Casey]], the alleged go-between, was dead by then, and it seemed impossible to account for all his moves during the summer of 1980, when he is said to have conferred with agents representing the Ayatollah Khomeini's government. <br/>+==Destination and Speed Positioning==<br/> <br/>-If the allegations are true, some believe that dealing with a hostile foreign government to achieve the defeat of a domestic administration would have been an act of [[treason]].<br/>+Vehicle drivers and cyclists who are traveling in accordance to the vehicular rules of the road use '''speed positioning''' between intersections.  That is, drivers of slower vehicles generally operate in the rightmost (leftmost in England) lane, and ''when width allows'', even keep far enough to the side to allow faster traffic to share the rightmost lane.<br/> <br/>-According to Sick's theory, [[Oliver North]] was the administration's scapegoat, taking responsibility in order to conceal the "treason" of Reagan and Bush. A [[PBS]] documentary, "The Secret Government," hosted by Bill Moyers, detailed the "off the shelf, self-financing, independent covert operations" entity mentioned by North, and tracing it to its cold war beginnings won an [[Emmy]] for best documentary film.<br/>+As a driver approaches an intersection, '''destination positioning''' comes into play.  Here, drivers of slow vehicles choose the rightmost (leftmost in England) lane that serves their destination.  For example, if the rightmost lane is right-only, drivers (who are not turning right) merge left into the adjacent lane.  Also, lane position for drivers of narrow vehicles (like motorcycles as well as bicycles) is also dictated by destination.  For example, in a lane that serves destinations to the left, straight and right, a cyclist would travel along the left side if going left, along the right side if going right, and in between if going straight.  In a lane that goes straight or right, the cyclist's position within the lane should be reflected by his destination.  However, when turning, a narrow vehicle driver should be careful to not move so far to the side so as to invite other drivers to squeeze in next to him within the lane during the turn.<br/> <br/>-==See also==<br/>-* [[George Bush family conspiracy theory]]<br/>-* [[Iran-Contra]]<br/>-* [[Iran hostage crisis]]<br/>-The issue of an October Surprise first came to light during an investigation by a House of Representatives Subcommittee into how the 1980 Reagan Campaign obtained debate briefing materials of then President Carter.  During the investigation, the Subcommittee on Human Resources of the House Post Office and Civil Service Committee obtained access to Reagan Campaign documents and discovered numerous instances of documents and memorandum referencing a monitoring effort for any such October Surprise.  The Subcommittee, Chaired by former US Rep. Donald Albosta (D-MI) issued a comprehensive report in 1984 describing each type of information that was detected and its possible source.  There is a section in the report dedicated to the October Surprise issue.<br/>+Vehicular Cycling experts recommend that, and the laws generally allow for, cyclists to establish the center of the lane (between the left and right tracks of cars) as their ''default'' or ''primary riding position'' when there is no reason to ride in the ''secondary riding position'' close to the edge of the roadway (i.e., when faster same-direction is present, wants to pass, and it is safe and reasonable to move into the ''secondary riding position'').  In general, like motorcyclists, bicyclists are much more visible and predictable in the ''primary riding position'' (and, hence, less likely to be not seen or not noticed) than when they are riding closer to the edge of the roadway.<br/>+<br/>+==Looking Back==<br/>+<br/>+The trivial sounding skill of ''looking back'' over one's shoulder is critical to vehicular cycling.  It's not as easy to perform as it may sound because it requires traveling in a straight line while looking behind for up to a few seconds, and requires some practice to master.  The natural tendency is to not continue in a straight line, but to swerve in the direction one is looking.<br/>+<br/>+''Looking back'' is essential whenever a cyclist needs to move laterally on the roadway for two reasons: 1) to make sure that he will not be moving in front of someone else, or violating another's [[right-of-way]], and 2) to communicate to others that he plans on moving.  Cycling experts contend that simply ''looking back'' often suffices as a signal to others that a cyclist wishes to move laterally in the direction he turned his head, and that a hand signal is often not required (this is important because using hand signals requires the cyclist to remove one hand from the handlebars, which is not desireable in many situations).  Most [[Effective Cycling]] students confirm that they are surprised to learn how quickly motorists often yield the right-of-way when they try the ''look back'' signaling technique for the first time.<br/>+<br/>+==Negotiation==<br/>+Many cycling experts explain the concept of '''negotiation''', and its role in traffic cycling vehicularly, when merging across multiple lanes of traffic.  The basic idea is to gain control of one lane at a time, and ''negotiate'' for the [[right of way]] in the adjacent lane before moving into and controlling it.  This is an important ''vehicular cycling'' skill because it alleviates the cyclist from having to execute a pedestrian style left turn, which involves switching modes to pedestrian and then back to vehicular again.  <br/>+<br/>+The first step in merging across multiple lanes involves merging (after ''looking back'') to ''use the full lane''.  Once control of the outside lane has been established, the cyclist moves towards the inside of the lane, signalling his intent to merge into the adjacent lane.  Often simply ''looking back'' is all that is required to signal this intent, but sometimes the cyclist must use a hand signal to coax a passing motorist to slow down and yield the [[right-of-way]] to let him in.  Once right-of-way is established in the adjacent lane, the cyclist moves in, [[using the full lane]], and repeats the process until he reaches his destination lane (from which his turn is allowed).  The key to the process is that the cyclist is never cycling in front of someone who has not explicitly yielded the [[right-of-way]] to him.<br/>+<br/>+==The VC Attitude==<br/>+In the end, VC is as much about attitude as anything else.  Without the VC attitude, no matter the skills, one cannot ride in traffic vehicularly.  One really must believe, deep down, that as a cyclist he is a vehicle driver -- that he has the same rights as other vehicle drivers and that it is safe and not discourteous to assert those rights -- before he can act as a vehicle driver. Acting as a vehicle driver is a critical prerequisite to being treated as one (if one does not act as a vehicle driver, he certainly won't be treated as one).<br/>+<br/>+==Misconceptions About VC==<br/>+There is considerable confusion expressed on the internet about the meaning of '''vehicular cycling'''.  Some people mistakenly describe '''VC''' as, "cycling as if you're a car".  But bicycles are not cars, and the vehicular rules of the road apply to not just cars, but all kinds of vehicles, from [[horse and buggy|horse and buggies]] to [[tractor trailer]]s, and everything in between, including bicycles.   Some rules have more relevance to drivers of some vehicles than to others because of unique physical and operational characteristics of some vehicles.  For example, because of the narrow nature of motorcycles, motorcyclists can often share (split) lanes that are too narrow for two standard width vehicles to share.   This is also true for bicyclists, whose vehicles also have the narrow characteristic.  Truck drivers require special training, as do bus and taxi drivers, and motorcyclists.  Some people advocate special training for cyclists to learn '''vehicular cycling''', such as the [[Effective Cycling]] program.  One of the main vehicular rules that has special application to cyclists riding on roadways is that drivers of slower vehicles should keep to the side (when safe and reasonable) ''between intersections'', though many people forget that ''at intersections and their approaches'' lane position should be selected according to destination.  Cyclists who ride in the center of a lane needlessly impeding faster traffic are sometimes mistakenly referred to as ''vehicular cyclists''; yet by definition a cyclist who ''needlessly'' impedes faster traffic is violating the vehicular rules of the road and is hence '''not''' riding vehicularly.  Another misconception about VC -- that riding in [[bike lane]]s is non-vehicular -- probably stems from an opposition to bike lanes by [[John Forester]]. Nevertheless, Forester himself has written and said on numerous occasions that riding vehicularly often involves riding in bike lanes, particularly when the facility happens to represent the most appropriate place to cycle for the given circumstance and conditions.  So VC does not require staying out of bike lanes all the time.<br/>+<br/>+==VC Authoritative Sources==<br/>+Forester's book, [[Effective Cycling]], is generally considered the primary reference on '''vehicular cycling'''.<br/>+<br/>+Without using the term '''vehicular cycling''' ''per se'', John Franklin does an excellent job describing the philosophy in his book, '''Cyclecraft'''.  He too advocates cycling in accordance to the vehicular rules of the road.  Using terms such as '''primary riding position''' &#151; meaning in the center of the traffic lane &#151; and '''secondary riding position''' &#151; meaning about 1 meter (3 feet) to the side of moving traffic, but not closer than .5 meters (1.5 feet) to the edge of the road, Franklin advocates the '''primary riding position''' as the normal position and the '''secondary riding position''' only when safe and reasonable to allow faster traffic to pass.<br/>+<br/>+Another source for education regarding the basics of '''vehicular cycling''' is John S. Allen's pamphlet, '''Bicycling Street Smarts''', available for free on his website (see below).<br/>+<br/>+Still more descriptions of '''vehicular cycling''' can be found by following the [[Vehicular_cycling#References|links below]].<br/>+<br/>+==VC Alternatives==<br/>+An alternative to '''vehicular cycling''' is ''pedestrian cycling'', or cycling according to the pedestrian rules of the road.  This means riding on sidewalks, crosswalks and paths at pedestrian speeds. It is important to be aware that the use of footpaths or sidewalks by cyclists is forbidden in many countries.  In addition, where such activities are illegal, cyclists may be held totally liable for any injuries to other parties or damage to property resulting from such behaviour.  Cycling experts contend that while ''pedestrian cycling'' can be accomplished safely, one should be aware of the peculiar hazards associated with this activity, including but not limited to:<br/>+* Opening passenger-side doors.<br/>+* Pedestrians, dogs, children playing, etc.<br/>+* Potential conflicts with other vehicles at all intersections, including driveways and alleys as well as major intersections.<br/>+* Entering crosswalks, where drivers turning into your path are often looking the other way.<br/>+<br/>+Some cyclists routinely operate not in accordance with either the vehicular or pedestrian system.  Car-bike collision statistics indicate that such cyclists are particularly vulnerable.<br/>+<br/>+Many cyclists use a combination of vehicular and pedestrian cycling.  This approach has the drawback that extra care must be taken when transitioning from one mode to the other, since transitioning often leads to actions not expected by others.  In particular, during a transition, a cyclist must yield the right-of-way to both pedestrians and vehicle drivers.<br/>+<br/>+==VC Education==<br/>+Besides VC self-education from studying books, one may be trained in ''vehicular cycling'' by taking courses from organizations like the [[League of American Bicyclists]] and Can-Bike.<br/>+<br/>+==VC Advocacy==<br/>+Advocates of '''vehicular cycling''', like Forester, Franklin and Allen, argue that cycling in accordance to the vehicular rules of the road is the safest and most effective means to use a bicycle for transportation.<br/>+<br/>+Some VC advocates contend that cyclists should only ride vehicularly, believing that non-vehicular cycling is not only less safe, but leads to less societal acceptance of cyclists who do cycle vehicularly.<br/>+<br/>+Some VC advocates oppose [[Segregated_cycle_facilities|segregated cycling facilities]] like [[bike lane debate|bike lanes]] because they inhibit and discourage cycling integrated with other vehicular traffic.<br/>+<br/>+==See Also==<br/>+* [[effective cycling]]<br/>+* [[bike lane debate]]<br/>+<br/>+==Bibliography==<br/>+* ''Effective Cycling'' by John Forester (First edition, 1976; Sixth edition, The MIT Press, 1993) ISBN 0262560704<br/>+* ''Cyclecraft'' by John Franklin (First edition, Stationery Office Books, 1999) ISBN 0117020516<br/> <br/> ==References==<br/>-*[[Abbie Hoffman]] and Johnathan Silvers, "An election held hostage," ''Playboy Magazine'', October 1988<br/>-*Barbara Honegger, 1989.

In the following decade, the club won four World Series championships in a six-year span despite changing ownership several times. The [[1912]] and [[1915]] clubs featured an outfield considered to be among the finest in the game:  [[Tris Speaker]], [[Harry Hooper]] and [[Duffy Lewis]].<br/>+[[Image:BoSox_Outfield.JPEG|thumb|157px|right|Duffy Lewis, Tris Speaker and Harry Hooper - Boston's famous "Million-Dollar Outfield". Photo: ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' archives.]]<br/>+The Red Sox were owned by [[Joseph Lannin]] from [[1913]] to [[1916]] and he signed [[Babe Ruth]], commonly seen as the best player in baseball history. In [[1919]], the team's new owner, [[Harry Frazee]], sold Ruth to the [[New York Yankees]]. Legend has it that he did so in order to finance a [[Broadway]] play ''[[No, No Nanette]]'' starring 'a friend', but in actual fact the play did not open on Broadway until [[1925]]. Rather, Frazee sold Ruth mostly because he was a serious disciplinary problem (and continued to be one in New York) and because although Ruth was a ''star'', it was not necessarily apparent that he would become the ''superstar'' player he quickly became in New York. The contract was a straight sale; the Red Sox got no players in return. Frazee also unloaded a number of other Hall of Fame quality players to the Yankees for other reasons. [[Carl Mays]] quit the team in mid-game and refused to return; his trade was essentially a salvage operation. Other Frazee era players went to New York as part of Frazee's financial strategy after he decided to leave baseball, having been driven out by Ban Johnson, including [[Sad Sam Jones]] and [[Waite Hoyt]]. These players (some of them Hall of Fame members) formed the nucleus of the first championship Yankee teams of the 1920s.<br/>+<br/>+===[[Tom Yawkey]] and [[Ted Williams]]===<br/>+[[Image:Tedwilliams and tomyawkey.jpg|left|frame|Ted Williams & Tom Yawkey]]<br/>+In [[1933]], a wealthy, shy young man named Tom Yawkey bought the Red Sox and began pumping money into the team.<br/>+<br/>+In [[1939]], the Red Sox purchased the contract of [[outfielder]] Ted Williams, then playing in the [[Pacific Coast League]], ushering in an era of the team sometimes called the "Ted Sox".  Williams was perhaps the most obsessive hitter in baseball history, and is generally considered the greatest hitter of all time, being able to hit for both power and average.  Stories of his being able to hold a bat in his hand and correctly estimate its weight down to the ounce have floated around baseball circles for decades.  ''Science of Hitting'',  his book on the subject, is considered by some as a bible of hitting theory and science.   He is also the last player to hit over .400 for a full season, in [[1941]].<br/>+<br/>+With Williams, the Red Sox went to the World Series in [[1946]], but lost to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], in part because of the use of the "Williams Shift", in which the shortstop would move to the right side of the infield to make it harder for the left-handed-hitting Williams to hit to that side of the field.  Some have claimed that Williams was too proud to hit to the other side of the field, not wanting to let the Cardinals take away his game.  He did not hit well in the Series, gathering only five singles in 25 at-bats, for a .200 average.  However, this was also likely influenced by an elbow injury he had received a few days before when he was hit by a pitch in an exhibition game.<br/>+<br/>+The Red Sox featured several other very good players during the [[1940s]], including SS [[Johnny Pesky]] (for whom the right field foul pole in Fenway - "Pesky's Pole" - is named), 2B [[Bobby Doerr]], and CF [[Dom DiMaggio]] (brother of [[Joe DiMaggio|Joe]]).  Despite this, they lost the pennant by one game in each of [[1948]] and [[1949]], and Williams never played in another World Series.<br/>+<br/>+The [[1950s]] were a lean time for the Red Sox.  After Williams returned from the [[Korean War]], many of the best players from the late [[1940s]] had retired or been traded.  The stark contrast in the team led critics to call the Red Sox daily lineup "Ted Williams and the Seven Dwarfs".  Also, unlike many other teams, they refused to sign black players, even passing up a chance at future Hall-of-Famers [[Jackie Robinson]] and [[Willie Mays]], both of who tried out for Boston and were highly praised by team scouts. Ted Williams hit .388 at the age of 38 in [[1957]], but there was little else for Boston fans to root for.  Williams retired at the end of the [[1960]] season, famously hitting a home run in his final at-bat. The Sox finally became the last Major League team to sign an [[African American]] player when they signed modest [[infield|infielder]] [[Pumpsie Green]] in [[1959]].  <br/>+<br/>+Supposedly the right-field bullpens in Fenway Park were built in part for Williams' left-handed swing, and these are sometimes called "Williamsburg".<br/>+<br/>+===[[Carl Yastrzemski|Carl "Yaz" Yastrzemski]]===<br/>+[[Image:Carl yastrzemski.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Carl "Yaz" Yastrzemski]]<br/>+The [[1960s]] also started poorly for the Red Sox, though [[1961]] saw the debut of Carl Yastrzemski ("Yaz"), who would become one of the best hitters of the pitching-rich decade.<br/>+<br/>+Red Sox fans remember [[1967]] as the year of the "Impossible Dream."  The team had finished the [[1966]] season in ninth place, but they found new life with Yaz leading the team to the World Series.  Yaz won the American League [[Triple crown (baseball)|Triple Crown]] and put on one of the greatest displays of hitting down the stretch in baseball history.  But the Red Sox lost the series  - again to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]].  The 1967 season is remembered as one of the great pennant races in baseball history since four teams were in the AL pennant race until almost the last game.<br/>+<br/>+The Sox won the AL pennant in [[1975]], with Yaz surrounded by other stars such as rookie outfielders [[Jim Rice]] and [[Fred Lynn]] (who won both the AL [[MLB Rookie of the Year award|Rookie of the Year]] and [[MLB Most Valuable Player award|MVP]] awards), veteran outfielder [[Dwight Evans]], catcher [[Carlton Fisk]], and pitchers [[Luis Tiant]] and the eccentric junkballer [[Bill Lee]].<br/>+<br/>+Game 6 of the [[1975 World Series]], against the [[Cincinnati Reds]]' so-called "Big Red Machine," is regarded by some as the greatest game in baseball postseason history, an extra-inning drama featuring dramatic home runs by [[Bernie Carbo]] and Fisk (the latter a game-winner, the famous 'body English' homerun). Despite the series-tying win, the Red Sox lost Game 7, and this time it would be Yaz who never again played in a World Series.<br/>+<br/>+The Red Sox may have lost to the National League champions in the World Series, but their true rivals were the [[New York Yankees]], who after the Babe Ruth trade in 1919 would go on to win 26 World Series championships.  The race for the pennant often came to a close competition between the Red Sox and the Yankees.  The Red Sox-Yankees rivalry came to a head in the [[1978]] season, when the two clubs finished the regular season in a tie for the American League East division title.  A winner-take-all playoff game was held at Fenway Park.  The Yankees drove a stake through the hearts of Red Sox fans when [[Bucky Dent]] drove a game-winning home run over the [[Green Monster]].<br/>+<br/>+===The "[[Curse of the Bambino]]"===<br/>+[[Image:Babe_Ruth_Red_Sox.JPEG|thumb|225px|left|Babe Ruth, as a young pitcher for the Red Sox]]<br/>+<br/>+===After the Yawkeys===<br/>+<br/>+Tom Yawkey had passed away in [[1976]], and his wife [[Jean R. Yawkey|Jean]] took control of the team, until her death in [[1992]], ending over 60 years of Yawkey ownership.  A trust controlled by [[John Harrington (Red Sox CEO)|John Harrington]] took control of the team.<br/>+<br/>+Longtime Sox general manager [[Lou Gorman]] was replaced in [[1994]] by [[Dan Duquette]], who had previously run the [[Montreal Expos]].  Duquette's reign began with promises to revive the flagging Sox [[minor league baseball|farm system]], but ended with several huge contracts to major stars and a great deal of public acrimony.  The fans and local media often turned on the players; general managers humiliated the manager; managers and players sniped at each other.<br/>+<br/>+In the strike-shortened [[1995]] season, the Sox won the newly-realigned [[American League East]], finishing 7 games ahead of the rival Yankees. Once again, they were swept, this time 3-0 by the [[Cleveland Indians]], running their postseason losing streak to 13 games, dating back to the 1986 World Series.<br/>+<br/>+In [[1998]] the Red Sox traded for Expos star pitcher [[Pedro Martínez]], and signed him to a long-term contract. Martinez would have several spectacular seasons for the Red Sox. In 1998 they won the wild card, but again lost the [[American League Division Series]] to the Indians, this time 3-1, despite winning Game 1 11-3 behind Martinez. <br/>+<br/>+In [[1999]] they got revenge on the Indians. Cleveland took a 2-0 series lead, but the Red Sox won Game 3 9-3 behind the pitching of [[Ramón Martínez (baseball pitcher)|Ramón Martínez]], Pedro's brother, and [[Derek Lowe]]. Game 4 was a blowout 23-7 win for the Red Sox and the highest scoring playoff game in history. Game 5 was a tense affair, with the Indians taking a 5-2 lead after two innings, but Pedro Martínez, nursing a shoulder injury, came on in the fourth inning and pitched six innings of no-hit ball while the offense rallied for a 12-8 win, behind two home runs from [[Troy O'Leary]]. The Red Sox then met the 26 Time World Champion [[New York Yankees]] and lost 4 games to 1. <br/>+<br/>+The Duquette era ended in [[2002]], when president and Yawkey trustee John Harrington sold the Red Sox to a consortium comprising [[John Henry (baseball)|John Henry]], Tom Werner, and Les Otten, with [[Larry Lucchino]] as president and CEO. Duquette was fired, and replaced for the 2002 season by Mike Port. After almost hiring [[Oakland Athletics|Oakland]]'s [[Billy Beane]] during the 2002 off-season, the Red Sox promoted [[Yale University|Yale]] graduate [[Theo Epstein]] to general manager. At 28, he became the youngest GM in the history of the Major Leagues.<br/>+<br/>+[[June 27]], [[2003]], the Red Sox established a new Major League Baseball record by scoring 10 runs against the [[Florida Marlins]] before the Marlins could get an out in the first inning. <br/>+<br/>+The [[2003]] postseason delivered another blow to Red Sox fans.  The Sox rallied from a 2-0 deficit against the [[Oakland Athletics]] to win the best-of-5  American League Division Series.  They then faced the Yankees in the [[2003 American League Championship Series]]. In the deciding Game 7, Boston had a 5-2 lead over the Yankees in the 8th inning, but Pedro Martínez allowed three runs to tie the game, and the Red Sox lost the game 6-5 in 11 innings, on a home run by Yankee [[third baseman]] [[Aaron Boone]]. Many Red Sox fans blamed the loss on their manager, [[Grady Little]], for not removing Martínez after seven strong innings, when he began to show signs of tiring.  Most Red Sox fans saw this as the culmination of two years of questionable decisionmaking by Little, and it was the "straw that broke the camel's back" which led to him not being brought back the following offseason. He was replaced by [[Terry Francona]], a man who finally brought Boston a championship for the first time in 86 years. It took them awhile.<br/>+<br/>+===2004: A New Era===<br/>+During the offseason, the Red Sox acquired another ace pitcher in [[Curt Schilling]] and almost landed [[shortstop]] [[Alex Rodriguez]], but the deal fell through, and Rodriguez went to the Yankees instead. Nevertheless, the Red Sox were picked by many to win the American League East in [[2004]]. In seven meetings with New York in April, the Sox lost just one, and opened up a 4-game lead early in the season. Through midseason, the team struggled mightily, and fell more than 10 games behind New York. Management shook up the team at the MLB trading deadline on July 31 by trading shortstop [[Nomar Garciaparra]] to the [[Chicago Cubs]] in exchange for [[Orlando Cabrera]] of the [[Montreal Expos]] and [[Doug Mientkiewicz]] of the [[Minnesota Twins]] in a four-team deal. Also acquired, though less publicized, was speedy outfielder [[Dave Roberts]] of the [[LA Dodgers]] for minor league prospects. After splitting six games with the Yankees in September, the Red Sox remained in contention, but finished three games back in the AL East, again qualifying as the AL Wild Card.<br/>+<br/>+The playoffs started with a bang as the Red Sox swept the AL West champion [[Anaheim Angels]], winning Game 3 by a score of 8-6 on [[David Ortiz]]'s 10th inning [[walk-off home run]] over the [[Green Monster]]. The Red Sox thus advanced to a rematch in the [[2004 American League Championship Series]] against their bitter rivals: the [[New York Yankees]].  <br/>+<br/>+In Game 1, the Red Sox didn't have a hit until the seventh, and lost 10-7. Worse, Schilling left early in the game due to an ankle injury suffered in the Anaheim series. Pedro started Game 2 and pitched effectively, but the team lost 3-1 because of an unexpected pitching gem by [[Jon Lieber]]. In Game 3, the Red Sox were demolished 19-8, a game which set the record for most runs scored by both teams in a League Championship Series, to fall behind 3-0 in the series. In Game 4 of the playoff, down 4-3 in the ninth with Yankees closer [[Mariano Rivera]] on the mound, the Sox rallied thanks to a stolen base by Roberts, an [[Run batted in|RBI]] single by [[Bill Mueller]] and Ortiz's 2-run [[walk-off home run]] in the 12th inning to win the game 6-4. Again trailing the next night, the Sox again rallied, and in the 14th inning, Ortiz's RBI single won the game 5-4. Game 5 set a record for longest postseason game in terms of time (5 hours and 49 minutes) and for longest ALCS game (14 innings).  The Red Sox rally continued through Game 6, in which Schilling returned to pitch seven innings on an ankle held that had three sutures wrapped in a bloody, literally red sock, and into Game 7, when [[Johnny Damon]] (who affectionately referred to the team as "The Idiots" to describe its eclectic roster) hit a [[grand slam]] in the second inning and added another home run later. The Sox rolled 10-3 to win the series 4-3. <br/>+<br/>+They became the first team in baseball history (and the third in North American professional sports history, after the 1942 [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] and the 1975 [[New York Islanders]] of the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]) to rally from a 3-0 deficit to win a best-of-7 series. Neither of those teams had trailed in game four of their series, and the nature of the game is very different. Team sports such as hockey and basketball can have the same lineup in every game, and turning around a 3-0 deficit does not seem quite so insurmountable, although it is obvioulsy rare. In baseball, the lineup is not only different every day due to the change of pitchers, but also the same batters have to adjust to a different pitcher. The old theory was that a comeback from 3-0 was virtually impossible, because one of the pitchers that beat them in the first 3 games would likely beat them again. The new theory is that the old theory was flawed, perhaps because it was based on the notion of a dominant starter. In the modern game, starters seldom pitch a full game, especially in the critical post-season.<br/>+<br/>+The Red Sox comeback against the Yankees is generally regarded as the greatest comeback in North American sports history.  Conversely, it is also viewed as one of the worst team breakdowns in sports history, not just due to the Yankees' 3-0 series lead, but also because the Yankees have long been the greatest and most feared franchise in the sport.  The Yankees fielded a very capable team in 2004, winning the AL East with the largest total payroll in baseball, and after the season, they were not perceived as a "Cinderella" team whose carriage finally turned into a pumpkin, but rather an overpaid, arrogant and aging group of athletes who suffered an ignominious collapse at the hands of a bitter rival.  One writer, following the ALCS, predicted that this collapse would hang over this franchise for a long time.  Whether that proves to be true, or whether this proves to be merely another event in the two teams' century-old rivalry, will depend on the outcome of the 2005 season and later seasons.<br/>+<br/>+David Ortiz was named MVP of the ALCS.  Unfortunately the end of Game 7 did not go without [[2004_American_League_Championship_Series#The_post_game_riots|rioting]] in the streets of Boston.  An investigation by the city of Boston later found the [[police]] were largely at fault for the incident due to their use of improper crowd control techniques.<br/>+<br/>+The Red Sox moved on to the [[2004 World Series]] against the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], a team that had posted the best record in the major leagues winning 105 games on the season -- and the team that had defeated the Red Sox in the 1946 and 1967 World Series. Game 1 set a new record for the highest scoring World Series opening game (breaking the previous record set in 1932). Toward the end of the game, [[Manny Ramirez]] committed two errors, allowing St. Louis to tie the game. However, he was saved by second baseman [[Mark Bellhorn]], who hit the eventual game-winning two-run homer. The Sox defeated the Cardinals twice in Boston and twice in St. Louis to sweep the World Series, making this their first Series win since 1918. The final out of the game was made on Cardinals shortstop [[Edgar Rentería]] at 11:40 pm, in the midst of a [[lunar eclipse]].  [[Joe Castiglione]], a longtime radio broadcaster for the Red Sox, narrated, "Foulke to the set, the 1-0 pitch, here it is, swing and a ground ball stabbed by Foulke, he has it, he underhands to first, and the Boston Red Sox are the World Champions!  For the first time in 86 years, the Red Sox have won baseball's World Championship!  Can you believe it?" <br/>+<br/>+The Red Sox held a parade &ndash; or as Boston mayor [[Thomas Menino]] put it, a "rolling rally" &ndash; on [[Saturday]], [[October 30]], [[2004]]. A crowd of more than 3 million members of "Red Sox Nation" filled the streets of Boston to cheer as the team rode [[DUKW|Duck Tours]].<br/>+<br/>+The Red Sox were chosen by ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' as that magazine's [[Sportsman of the Year|Sportsmen of the Year]].  They are the first professional sports team to be chosen, and the only other teams to be chosen were the 1999 U.S. Women's soccer team and the 1980 'Miracle on Ice' U.S. Olympic hockey team.<br/>+<br/>+===The 2005 Season===<br/>+<br/>+The '''2005 Boston Red Sox season''' comes on the heels of their 2004 World Series championship.  Not only did the Red Sox win the series after a decades-long drought by sweeping the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in four games, they beat the [[New York Yankees]] four games to three in the [[ALCS]] after losing the first three games.  No baseball team in history had ever pulled off such a comeback.  In preseason polls the Sox were picked first or second in the league, along with the Yankees.<br/>+<br/>+====2005 Schedule====<br/>+<br/>+[[Major League Baseball]] has weighted Boston's schedule slightly, in line with its post-season success in 2004.  The schedule is created with the assistance of detailed forecasts of each team's relative success in the 2005 season, which are partially independent of the results of the 2004 season.  The weighting in the Bosox' schedule can be seen in Major League ball's choice of Atlanta and St. Louis as interleague foes, and also perhaps in the numbers in the non-divisional list below.<br/>+<br/>+====Home Division====<br/>+<br/>+In their division, the [[AL East]], the Red Sox have the following games:<br/>+<br/>+* [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] -19-<br/>+* New York Yankees
