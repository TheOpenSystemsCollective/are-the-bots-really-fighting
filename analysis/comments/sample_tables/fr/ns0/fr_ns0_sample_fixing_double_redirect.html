For other uses, see [[Atlantis (disambiguation)]].''<br/>-<br/>-[[Image:Atlantis1.jpg|thumb|400px|right|An artistic rendition of an imaginary Atlantis, based on Plato's description.]]<br/>-'''Atlantis''' was a [[legend]]ary ancient island, whose existence and location have never been confirmed.  The first mentions we have are from the [[classical Greek]] philosopher [[Plato]], who said that it was destroyed by  possibly an [[earthquake]] or [[tsunami]] about 9,000 years before his own time. Plato did mention it was somewhere outside the [[Pillars of Hercules]] (i.e. the [[Straits of Gibraltar]]), though some think its location would have been more suitable in one of the cradles of civilization, the [[Mediterranean Sea]].<br/>-<br/>-==Atlantis Time Line==<br/>-<br/>-*560 BC:  according to Plato, a famous Greek statesman, Solon, visits Egypt and hears from the priests at Sais, then the capital of Egypt, the story of an ancient civilization that was destroyed 9000 years earlier.<br/>-*360 BC: Plato first writes Solon’s story and calls the civilization “Atlantis.”<br/>-*300 BC-100 AD: various classical Mediterranean authors such as Crantor, Strabo, Diodorus Siculus, Pliny the Elder and Plutarch mention Atlantis. Belief in the lost continent is divided.<br/>-*1513: Admiral Piri Ibn Haji Mehmed, a [[Turkish]] admiral, makes the world's oldest map of the Americas. It becomes known as the [[Piri Reis Map]] (''reis'' is Turkish for ''Admiral''.) In it he draws out the Americas, Greenland, and a southern landmass where we know [[Antarctica]] to be. Piri, who knew many foreign langauges, including [[Greek language|Greek]], credited much of the map to earlier sources. The Piri Reis Map has been the center of much nonsensical speculation as to the possibilities of Antarctica and the lost continent of Atlantis being one and the same. <br/>-*1553: A Spaniard, Francesco Lopez de Gomara, makes the suggestion that Atlantis was in America. However, in many ways America does not match the description given by Plato.<br/>-*1860: Abbe Brasseur de Bourbourg, a French scholar, travels through Middle America for many years. He feels that Mayan glyphs document the volcanic destruction of Atlantis. These Mayan glyphs do in fact document great destruction caused by volcanoes and earthquakes, but we cannot be sure that this represents the destruction of Atlantis.<br/>-*1879: A famous Mayan archeologist, Edward Herbert Thompson, defends the idea that the Maya were descendants of an Atlantean race. <br/>-*1880s-1890s: Augustus Le Plongeon publishes ''Sacred Mysteries Among the Mayans and Quiches'' (1886) and ''Queen Moo and the Egyptian Sphinx'' (1896) after ten years of study in the Yucatan with his wife. He claims that Egyptian civilization, as well as all other civilizations, came from the Mayan. He states that Queen Moo was originally from Atlantis (which Le Plongeon calls Mu and situates in the Atlantic Ocean), but when Queen Moo seeks refuge there, she finds it gone, and goes on to Egypt were she was known as Isis and founded the Egyptian civilization. Le Plongeon’s work is interesting, in that there are a great many similarities between the Maya and the Egyptians. <br/>-*1883: Ignatius Donnelly, a former member of the US Congress writes ''Atlantis: the Antediluvian World'', a popular book that went through fifty editions and is still in print after 100 years. He states that Atlantis was the source of all cultures of the world, an idea which could now be supported by modern research into the source language known as Proto-Indo-European.<br/>-*1880s: [[Madame Blavatsky]], sometimes called the Grandmother of the “New Age” movement, includes Atlantis in her occult and bizarre reconstruction of history. For example, because of humanity’s widespread preoccupation with dragons, she believes that humans existed at the time of the dinosaurs. <br/>-*1908: [[Rudolf Steiner]] writes his own version of Atlantis.<br/>-*1909: In an anonymous letter to the London Times, classical scholar K. T. Frost points out similarities between the Mediterranean culture of Crete (also known as Minoan after King Minos who lived on Crete) and Plato’s “Atlantis.” Although there are similarities, Plato’s description of Atlantis does not match well that of ancient Crete.<br/>-*1930s: [[Edgar Cayce]] becomes famous in the US for going into a trance and then prescribing remedies for ill people. During these trance states he sometimes describes patients' past lives in Atlantis. He predicts that records of Atlantis will someday be found, in several locations. He also predicts that portions of Atlantis will rise again from the ocean. <br/>-*1931: author James Churchward writes, ''The Lost Continent of Mu''. He claims to have seen sacred tablets in India, which describe the creation of the world and a lost continent, which he calls Mu. He places Mu in the Pacific. <br/>-*1939: A Greek archeologist, Spyridon Marinatos, suggests that the destruction of the island of Thera in 1500 BC, and the resulting tsunami, was what caused the collapse of the Minoan civilization. In 1950, he suggests the Atlantis myth derives from this event. His paper is not published in English until 1969. Many modern scientists accept Thera as a possible Atlantis; however, Plato’s description is not a good match with Thera.<br/>-*1954: L. Sprague de Camp first publishes ''Lost Continents'', a Dover classic. However, de Camp is probably better known for his science fiction writing about “Conan: the Barbarian.” De Camp is a firm skeptic when it comes to Atlantis. He flatly states that Plato made up the story. Interestingly, he also says that Wagner’s Continental Drift Theory is “very doubtful.” (A 1970 edition, however, corrected this statement.) <br/>-*1973: Geologist Dorothy Vitaliano writes ''Legends of the Earth'' and includes a chapter on Atlantis. She believes that there is nowhere in the Atlantic Ocean that Atlantis could have existed.<br/>-*1974: James Bramwell writes ''Lost Atlantis'', perhaps one of the most rational and balanced accounts of the controversy ever published. Though parts of it are dated, his book often amazes one with its insight and depth. <br/>-*1975: Indiana University hosts a panel discussion “Atlantis: Fact or Fiction,” including several notable scholars. While most of them dismiss the Atlantis story as pure fiction, John V. Luce (Associate Professor of Classics, Dublin University) presents the view that Plato’s Atlantis story is part fiction, part fact, and based on ancient legends.<br/>-*1960s-1970s: seismologist A. G. Galanopoulos, another Greek, also tries to link “Atlantis” to the volcano on the island of Thera. He claims that an error in translation of Plato’s text multiplied all numbers by 10, and that is why Thera is ten times smaller than Plato described. Scholars (Vitaliano, Luce) have very effectively refuted this “ten error.” Also, there are many other mismatches between Thera and Atlantis (see Vitaliano). <br/>-*1995: Bill Lauritzen states on a newsgroup his hypothesis that South East Asia was probably the location that generated the Atlantis story.<br/>-*1997: Bill Lauritzen travels to the Sunda Plain of South East Asia to investigate firsthand his theory.    <br/>-*1998: Independently of Lauritzen, Arysio Nunes dos Santos of Brazil, posts an article on his web site stating that the Sunda Plain was Atlantis.<br/>-*1998: Steven Oppenheimer finishes "Eden in the East", a massive work that presents evidence from oceanography, archeology, linguistics, genetics and folklore that civilization did not begin in the Fertile Crescent of the Middle East, but on the (now mostly sunken) Sunda Plain, which is sometimes called Sundaland.<br/>-*1999: Independently of Oppenheimer or dos Santos, Bill Lauritzen posts his article on Atlantis on wwww.earth360.com. He states that Atlantis may have been on the Sunda Plain, and that the story may have been inspired by the Austronesian expansion.<br/>-*2002: Shirley Andrews publishes "Atlantis: Insights From a Lost Civilization", a book that compiles  some theories and ideas known about Atlantis. She examines languages, blood types, and ruined architecture.  She points out that the Aztecs describe their original homeland of Atl as a great island that sank into the ocean. However, Central America does not match well with Plato's desciption. It has no coconuts, elephants, or canals, which are all mentioned in Plato's account.<br/>-*2005: Marc-André Gutscher, of the University of Western Brittany, notes that Spartel Island, a submerged island just west of the Straits of Gibralter, could be Atlantis (published in ''Geology'').  He notes that the island, now 60m underwater, had been above water a few thousand years ago.  He also notes that thick turbidite deposits indicate a tsunami had hit it around 12000 years ago.  The location (just west of the "Pillars of Hercules") and age of destruction are consistent with Plato's account, though no evidence was found of human habitation prior to submersion. Also, it was not the right size for Atlantis as described by Plato.<br/>-<br/>-==Accounts==<br/>-According to historical accounts, the story of Atlantis was about the conflict between the ancient [[Athenians]] and the Atlanteans around 9,000 years before [[Plato]]'s existence. <br/>-<br/>-The origins of the story of Atlantis date back to Egyptian priests who transfered it to [[Solon]]. Soon Solon passed the tale to [[Dropides]], who was the great-grandfather of [[Critias]]. And Critias learned of it from his grandfather also named Critias, son of Dropides.<br/>-<br/>-===Plato===<br/>-''Main article: [[Critias %28Plato%29]]''<br/>-<br/>-Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' (21e - 25d) and his ''[[Critias]]'' are the only written accounts of Atlantis; in these Plato gives some information on the size and location of the island of Atlantis. Atlantis might be a work of fiction, yet an extended [[parable]] intended to illustrate Plato's philosophy of the ideal government. Plato's account purports to be based on a visit to [[Egypt]] by the Athenian lawgiver [[Solon]], itself quite possibly a legendary event. [[Sonchis]], priest of [[Thebes (Egypt)|Thebes]], is purported to have translated it into [[Greek language|Greek]] for Solon.<br/>-<br/>-According to Plato's story, over nine thousand years ago a war between those outside the ''pillars of Heracles'' and all who dwelt within them took place . Those on the outside were supposed to inhabit an island greater in extent than [[Libya]] and the [[Ancient Near East|then known Asia]]. This supposedly was sunk by an earthquake. The land became an impassable barrier to voyagers sailing to any part of the ocean. There was a [[plain]] which is said to have been very fertile. Near the plain, and also in the centre of the island at a distance of about fifty [[Ancient_Greek_weights_and_measures|stadia]], there was a [[mountain]] not very high on any side. There at the inner hill the land was  enclosed all round by alternate zones of sea and land larger and smaller, encircling one another; there were two of land and three of water.  The whole island and the ocean were called "''Atlantic''". The island was facing the country called the region of [[Gades]] (Greek, [[Eumelus]]; Atlantean, [[Gadeirus]]).<br/>-<br/>-===Aristotle===<br/>-[[Aristotle]] wrote of a large island in the Atlantic Ocean that the [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] knew as [[Antilia]].  [[Proclus]], the commentator of "Timaeus" mentions that [[Marcellus]], relying on ancient historians, stated in his ''[[Aethiopiaka]]'' that in the Outer Ocean (which meant all oceans, not just the Atlantic) there were seven small islands dedicated to [[Persephone]], and three large ones; one of these, comprising 1,000 ''stadia'' in length, was dedicated to [[Poseidon]].  Proclus tells us that [[Crantor]] reported that he, too, had seen the columns on which the story of Atlantis was preserved as reported by Plato: the [[Sais, Egypt|Saite]] priest showed him its history in [[Egyptian hieroglyph|hieroglyphic]] characters.  Some other writers called it ''Poseidonis'' after Poseidon. [[Plutarch]] mentions ''Saturnia'' or ''Ogygia'' about five days' sail to the west of what is called nowadays [[Britain]]. He added that westwards from that island, there were the three islands of [[Cronus]], to where proud and warlike men used to come from the continent beyond the islands, in order to offer sacrifice to the gods of the ocean.<br/>-<br/>-===Other Greek accounts===<br/>-An important [[Greece|Greek]] festival of [[Pallas Athene]], the [[Panathenaea]] was dated from the days of king [[Theseus]].  It consisted of a solemn procession to the [[Acropolis]] in which a [[peplos]] was carried to the goddess, for she had once saved the city, gaining victory over the nation of Poseidon, that is, the Atlanteans.  As [[Lewis Spence]] comments, this cult was in existence already 125 years before Plato, which means that the story could not be invented by him. The historian [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] wrote that the [[intelligentsia]] of [[Alexandria]] considered the destruction of Atlantis a historical fact and described a class of [[earthquake]]s that suddenly, by a violent motion, opened up huge mouths and so swallowed up portions of the earth, as once in the Atlantic Ocean a large island was swallowed up. [[Diodorus Siculus]] recorded that the Atlanteans did not know the fruits of [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]]. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] called this island "Satyrides," referring to the Atlantes and those who profess to know the measurements of the earth.  He states that far west of the Ocean there lies a group of islands whose inhabitants are red-skinned and whose hair is like that of the horse. ([[Christopher Columbus]] described the Indians similarly.)<br/>-A fragmentary work of [[Theophrastus]] of [[Lesbos]] tells about the colonies of Atlantis in the sea. [[Hesiod]] wrote that the garden of the [[Hesperides]] was on an island in the sea where the [[sun]] sets. [[Pliny the Elder]] recorded that this land was 12,000 km<!-- Surely he didn't wrote kilometers --> distant from [[Cádiz]], and Uba, a [[Numidian]] talks of an enormous island outside the [[Pillars of Hercules]]. He describes it as having a climate that is very mild; fruits and vegetables grow ripe throughout the year. There are huge mountains covered with large forests, and wide, irrigable plains with navigable rivers. [[Scylax of Caryanda]] gives similar account.<br/>-<br/>-Marcellus claims that the survivors of the sinking Atlantis migrated to [[Western Europe]]. [[Timagenes]] tells almost the same, citing the [[Druids]] of [[Gaul]] as his sources. He tries to classify the [[Gallic]] tribes according to their origins and tells of one of these claiming that they were colonists who came there from a remote island. [[Theopompus]] of [[Chios]], a Greek [[historian]] called this land beyond the ocean as "Meropis".  The dialogue between King [[Midas]] and the wise Silenus mentions the Meropids, the first men with huge cities of gold and silver. Silenus knows that besides the well-known portions of the world there is another, unknown, of incredible immensity, where immeasurably vast blooming meadows and pastures feed herds of various, huge and mighty beasts. [[Claudius Aelianus]] cites [[Theopompus]], knowing of the existence of the huge island out in the Atlantic as a continuing tradition among the Phoenicians or Carthaginians of Cádiz. Perhaps the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] friar [[Cosmas Indicopleustes]] understood Plato better than the ancient and modern "Aristotelians", says Merezhkovsky. In his ''[[Topographia Christiana]]'' he included a chart of the (flat) world: it showed an inner continent, a compact mainland surrounded by sea, and this was surrounded by an outer ring-shaped continent, with the inscription, "The earth beyond the Ocean, where men lived before the [[Flood]]." The [[Garden of Eden]] is placed in the eastern end of this continent.<br/>-<br/>-===Byzantine accounts===<br/>-In the mid-6th century, the Byzantine writer [[Jordanes]], who was no navigator himself, simply repeated common [[folklore]] of the eastern end of the Mediterranean when he said<br/>-:''"This same Ocean has in its western region certain islands known to almost everyone by reason of the great number of those that journey to and from. And there are two not far from the neighborhood of the Strait of [[Gades]], one the [[Blest Islands|Blessed Isle]] and another called the [[Fortunate Islands|Fortunate]]. Although some reckon as islands of Ocean the twin promontories of Galicia<!-- Is this Gallaecia? --> and [[Lusitania]], where are still to be seen the Temple of Hercules on one and Scipio's Monument on the other, yet since they are joined to the extremity of the Galician country, they belong rather to the great land of Europe than to the islands of Ocean."''  &mdash;Jordanes, ''[[Getica]]'', chapter 1:4.<br/>-<br/>-==Modern interest==<br/>-With rare exceptions, such as [[Francis Bacon]]'s book ''[[The New Atlantis]]'', interest in Atlantis then languished, until, some 2,200 years after Plato, the [[1882]] publication of ''[[Atlantis: the Antediluvian World]]'' by [[Minnesota]] politician and sometime [[crank]]ish writer [[Ignatius Donnelly]]. Donnelly took Plato's account of Atlantis seriously and attempted to establish that all known ancient civilizations were descended from its high-[[neolithic]] culture.<br/>-<br/>-Since Donnelly's day, there have been dozens &mdash; perhaps hundreds &mdash; of locations proposed for Atlantis. Some are more-or-less serious attempts at legitimate scholarly or archaeological works; others have been made by [[psychic]] or other [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] means.<br/>-<br/>-In the [[19th century]], the Atlantis myth became conflated with [[Mu (lost continent)|Mu]] and [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]]. Occultist [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky|Helena Blavatsky]] (''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'', [[1888]]) introduced the idea of the Atlanteans as cultural heroes (an aspect that is absent in Plato, who describes them mainly as a military threat to the Greeks), and described its inhabitants as the fourth "[[Root Race]]", succeeded by the "[[Aryan race]]". <br/>-[[Rudolf Steiner]] based much of his writings on occult revelations of Mu or Atlantis. <br/>-[[Edgar Cayce]] likewise proposed that Atlantis was an ancient, now-submerged, highly-evolved civilization. The [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] significance being that it was a land from which many of us continue to [[reincarnation|reincarnate]], with Cayce adding that the Atlanteans also had ships and aircraft powered by a mysterious form of energy crystal. The work ''[[Toward the Light]]'' ([[1920]]) claims to describe Atlantis, including its exact geographical location.  Through [[Theosophy]] and [[Anthroposophy]], the concept of Atlantis also entered [[Nazi Mysticism]]. [[Heinrich Himmler]] was inspired by [[Ferdinand Ossendowski]] to the belief that a remnant of the white Atlanteans were to be found in [[Tibet]], the search for which was part of the mission of the [[Nazi]] expedition to Tibet in 1938/9 led by [[Ernst Schäfer]]. According to [[Julius Evola]] (''[[Revolt Against the Modern World]]'', [[1934]]), the Atlanteans were [[Hyperboreans]] were Nordic [[superman|supermen]] who originated on the [[North pole]]. Similarly, [[Alfred Rosenberg]] (''[[The Myth of the Twentieth Century]]'', [[1930]]) spoke of a "nordic-atlantean" or "aryan-nordic" [[master race]]. [[Aleister Crowley]] has also written an esoteric history of Atlantis, although this may be intended more as [[metaphor]] than as fact. <br/>-<br/>-In the mid-[[1940s]], [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] reshaped his [[legendarium]] to contain elements of an Atlantis myth (see [[Atalantë]]). ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' ([[1954]]/5) contains only obscure references to this, and the myth was published only posthumously, in the ''[[Silmarillion]]'' ([[1977]]). [[Jane Roberts]]' work also contains references to Atlantis. The 1990 [[anime]] series ''[[Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water]]'', which is very broadly based on ''[[20,000 Leagues Under The Sea]]'' by [[Jules Verne]], has elements of modern Atlantean myth woven in, with a particularly Caycean flavor. The series was produced by [[Gainax]], the studio famous for [[Neon Genesis Evangelion|Evangelion]]. [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Pictures]] also produced an animated feature [[film]] based on the Atlantis legend, ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'' (2001).<br/>-<br/>-==Location hypotheses==<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-===Eastern hemisphere===<br/>-<br/>-Some investigators believe that Atlantis is in the Eastern Hemisphere, which would have the location in [[Europe]], [[Asia]], [[Africa]] and [[Oceania]].<br/>-<br/>-====Mediterranean====<br/>-<br/>-Because some basic and nomadic civilizations began around the [[Mediterranean]] area and is part of the [[Cradle of Humanity]] (Between the rivers Euphrates and Tigris, modern day Iraq), some believe that Atlantis is located here. Some factors that weigh toward this location was the [[Minoan civilization]], which flourished on the island of [[Crete]], and the river valley civilizations which had large populations. <br/>-An other more recent thesis, that seems to be receiving credit from the offical scientific world, suggests that the lost island could be the island of Sardinia where the astonishing amount of traces left by the so called [[Nuraghe|Nuragic civilization]] has never been seriously investigated.<br/>-<br/>-=====Sardinia=====<br/>-In [[2002]] the Italian journalist Sergio Frau in his book ''Le colonne d'Ercole'' hypothesized that the [[Pillars of Hercules]] could be identified not with Gibraltar but with the [[Sicily Strait]] between Africa and [[Sicily]], so Atlantis was really [[Sardinia]]. A catastrophic event (with a big wave) eradicated from Sardinia the ancient and still enigmatic [[Nuraghe|Nuragic civilization]]. The few survivors migrated to the near Italian peninsula, founding the [[Etruscan civilization]], the base for the later [[Roman civilization]]. In April 2005 the theories of the Italian journalist were debated in high level conference organised by UNESCO in Paris. Together with the conference, also an exposition with the major findings of the theory (ATLANTIKA') and it's evidence was also exposed in the UNESCO building to confirm that the organization's experts are taking quite seriously the hypothesis, and that this seems not to be "just another atlantis theory".<br/>-<br/>-=====Crete and Santorini=====<br/>-<br/>-Among those who believe in an historical Atlantis, a common hypothesis holds that Plato's story of the destruction of Atlantis was inspired by massive volcanic eruptions on the Mediterranean island of [[Santorini]] during Minoan times. [[Scientific skepticism|Skeptic]]s of an Atlantic Ocean location usually promote this theory. Some consider this to be the likeliest hypothesis, though investigators (such as Frank Joseph) discount this theory as misleading. A main criticism of this hypothesis is that the ancient Greeks were well aware of volcanoes, and if there was a volcanic eruption, it would seem likely that it would be mentioned. Additionally, [[Amenhotep III|Pharaoh Amenhotep III]] commanded an emissary to visit the cities surrounding Crete and found the towns occupied shortly after the time Santorini was speculated to have completely destroyed the area.<br/>-<br/>-Part of this hypothesis proposes, because Solon received his information from Egypt, that we assume that the [[Ancient Egyptian]] symbol for "hundred" was mistakenly read as "thousand". If this was possible, the translation would reduce the age and size of Atlantis by a factor of ten. This alteration would make Atlantis fit Minoan Crete well in size and age. Though, a translation error is ''unlikely'' because there would be little confusion in the visual appearance of [[Egyptian hieroglyph|hieroglyphic]] symbols of [[Egyptian numerals|Egyptian numeric values]].<br/>-<br/>-=====Off the east coast of Cyprus=====<br/>-[[Robert Sarmast]], an American architect, claims to have definitely found the lost city of Atlantis on [[November 14]], [[2004]], saying that by using [[sonar]] scans he was able to find manmade walls that matched the description of the structures described by [[Plato]], [[CNN]] reports. The site lies 1,500m deep in the Mediterranean Sea between [[Cyprus]] and [[Syria]].<small><sub>[http://athens-olympics-2004.newkerala.com/?action=fullnews&id=42709]</sub></small> Several geologists were quick to dispute the claim, as the place was deep under water during the period in question.<br/>-<br/>-Recent research (4th of August 2005) has been done by [[Robert Sarmast]] in the Eastern Mediterranean sea between Cyprus and Syria. The sonar scans showed evidence of man-made structures one mile below sea level which is possibly a canal wall. It is a 3 km-long straight wall intersected at right angles by another wall.[[http://www.discoveryofatlantis.com]]<br/>-<br/>-===== Malta =====<br/>-Dr Anton Mifsud who, with co-authors Simon Mifsud, Chris Agius Sultana and Charles Savona Ventura, published Malta ''Echoes of Plato's Island'' also added another recent hypothesis.Their book is the product of thoughtful and profound research about the archeological sites and ancient remains related to Atlantis. Frances Galea in his book ''Malta Fdal Atlantis'' also wrote about the results of his lifelong research on several ancient studies and known hypotheses on Atlantis, particularly that of Giorgio [[Grongnet]], the renowned Maltese architect, who in 1854 claimed that the Maltese Islands are the remnants of Atlantis.<br/>-<br/>-=====Near Cape Spartel=====<br/>-Another recent hypothesis is based on a recreation of the geography of the Mediterranean at the time of Atlantis' supposed existence.  Plato states that Atlantis was located beyond the [[Pillars of Hercules]], the name given to the [[Straits of Gibraltar|Strait of Gibraltar]] linking the Mediterranean to the Atlantic Ocean.  11,000 years ago the sea level in the area was some 130 metres lower, exposing a number of islands in the strait.  One of these, [[Spartel]], could have been Atlantis, though there are a number of inconsistencies with Plato's account.<br/>-<br/>-=====Troy=====<br/>-The geoarchaeologist [[Eberhard Zangger]] has proposed the hypothesis that Atlantis was in fact the city state of [[Troy]]. He both agrees and disagrees with Rainer W. Kühne: He too believes that the Trojans-Atlanteans were the sea peoples, but only a minor part of them.  He proposes that all Greek speaking city states of the [[Aegean civilization]] or [[Mycenae]] constituted the sea peoples and that they destroyed each other's economies in a series of semi-fratricidal wars lasting several decades.<br/>-<br/>-=====Tantalis=====<br/>-British archaeologist [[Peter James]] took a clue from Plato's mention of king Tantalus, and investigated the city of Tantalis (also Tantalos) in the province of [[Manisa]], [[Turkey]]. In addition to having very similar sounding anagram names, numerous inscriptions and ancient writings from the region matched the Atlantis story. Tantalis, formerly a wealthy city state, was destroyed when a powerful earthquake struck and caused a lake to flood the city.<br/>-<br/>-=====Andalucia=====<br/>-An hypothesis by [[Juan Fernández Amador de los Ríos]] (1919), [[Jürgen Spanuth]] (1953), [[Georgeos Díaz-Montexano]] (2000) "''Atlantis Discovery''", [[Rainer W. Kühne]] (2003) suggests that the Atlanteans were the [[Sea Peoples]] who attacked the Eastern Mediterranean countries around 1200 BC. The city and state of Atlantis were located in [[Andalucia]], 50 kilometers southwest of [[Seville]]. [[Werner Wickboldt]] (2002) and [[Rainer W. Kühne]] (2003) claim that recent satellite photos show two rectangular structures, which they hypothesized to be the "temple of Poseidon" and "the temple of Cleito and Poseidon".<br/>-<br/>-=====Ponza=====<br/>-<br/>-[[Ponza]] has many similarities to the Atlantis legend. Legend say that Ponza was the lost island of [[Tyrhenia]] which was large and had a city at its edge. It was connected by land to the [[Italy|Italian]] mainland near [[Naples]] (Napoli). A volcano exploded and the island sunk leaving only the mountain top which is now called Ponza. Near Naples is [[Pozzuoli]] where [[Roman Temple]]s in the harbor rose above water in the late 1960's due to volcanic processes.<br/>-<br/>-====Black Sea====<br/>-German researchers Siegfried and Christian Schoppe locate Atlantis in the [[Black Sea]]: Before 5500 BC there was a great plain in the northwest at a former freshwater-lake. In 5510 BC, the barrier at today's [[Bosporus]] broke due to the rising sea level. The Pillars of Hercules are identical with the Strait of Bosporus. [[Oreichalcos]] means the [[obsidian]] stone that used to be a cash-equivalent at that time and was replaced by the [[spondylus]] shell around 5500 BC. The geocatastrophic event led to the [[neolithic diaspora]] in Europe, also beginning 5500 BC.<br/>-<br/>-In 2000 AD, the Guardian reported that Robert Ballard, in a small submarine, found remains of human habitation around 300 feet underwater in the Black Sea off the north coast of Turkey. The area flooded around 5000 BC. This flood may have inspired the [[Bible|Biblical]] story of [[Noah's Ark]]; but the area need not to be Atlantis.<br/>-<br/>-Another candidate bordering the Black Sea, suggested by [[Hasan Umur]] in the [[1940s]], would be [[Ancomah]] , a legendary place near [[Trabzon]].<br/>-<br/>-==== Antarctica ====<br/>-Rand & Rose Flem-Ath propose in their book, "When the Sky Fell" that Antarctica was Atlantis.  A geological theory known as earth crust displacement and one of the few serious examinations of the size of Plato's lost continent form the basis of their work. The Flem-Aths' detailed study of fascinating world myths opens up the possibility that ancient peoples left their own record of the catastrophe.<br/>-<br/>-====Finland====<br/>-Finnish pseudohistorian [[Ior Bock]] locates Atlantis to the southern part of [[Finland]] where he claims a small community of people lived during the [[Ice Age]]. This is a small part of a large [[saga]] that he claims to have been told in his family through the ages, dating back to the development of language itself. Ior also believes that he is a descendant of an ancient Finnish god [[Lemminkäinen]].<br/>-<br/>-====Ireland====<br/>-In 2004, this theory was presented and tested scientifically in the book ''[[Atlantis from a Geographer's Perspective: Mapping the Fairy Land]]'' by [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[geography|geographer]] Dr. Ulf Erlingsson from University of [[Uppsala]]. It hypothesizes that the empire Atlantis refers to the [[Neolithic]] [[Megalithic tomb]] culture, based on their similar geographic extent. The island Atlantis is deduced to be [[Ireland]]. The similarities of both size and landscape are found to be statistically significant to the 2% level, while the null hypothesis (that Plato invented Atlantis as fiction) is rejected. <br/>-<br/>-The capital Atlantis is tentatively connected with [[Newgrange]], [[Knowth]], and [[Tara, Ireland]]. Ireland has not sunk beneath the sea, but the [[Dogger Bank]] shoal was an island that sank in the [[North Sea]] about 6100 B.C. While the world sea level rose gradually as the [[Ice Age]] ice sheets melted, there was a sudden rise at this time due to the final drainage of [[Lake Agassiz]]. At about the same time a [[tsunami]] from the [[Storegga Slide]] is believed to have devastated the island in the manner described by Plato. <br/>-<br/>-Some related hypotheses place the location of Atlantis between Britain and France on the [[Celtic Shelf]]. <small><sub>[http://www.grahamhancock.com/underworld/CrispDanAtlantis.php?p=3]</sub></small> This hypothesis was first developed seriously by [[Lewis Spence]] and has been recently revived by some oceanographers.<br/>-<br/>-====[[Indonesia]]/[[Sundaland]]====<br/>-Prof. Arysio Nunes dos Santos, Ph. D. in Nuclear Physics; Free-Docent, and Professor of Nuclear Physics at the Federal University of Minas Gerais, [[Brazil]], has been researching on Atlantis for almost 30 years now, pointing out that "Atlantis was never found because we have all been looking in the wrong places". The reason for this, according to Prof. Santos, is that when Plato spoke of the ''Ocean of Atlantis'', he was not speaking of the ocean that we ''today'' call ''Atlantic Ocean'', but of the whole ocean that encircles Eurasia and Africa, formerly known as the atlantic ocean.<br/>-<br/>-In the U.S., researcher Bill Lauritzen independently came to the same conclusion regarding the Atlantic Ocean. He traveled to the Sunda Plain in 1997 to further investigate and many photos of this area are in his book, "The Atom and the Soul." Lauritzen points out that the "Destruction of Mankind" story of the Pyramid Texts of Egypt is very similar to the Atlantis story and may have been the basis for it. He also mentions that most of the other locations suggested for Atlantis had no elephants, while Atlantis and Indonesia did have elephants.<br/>-<br/>-Says Lauritzen in "The Atom and the Soul":<br/>-<br/>-"These are several possible conclusions we might draw:<br/>-* 9000 BC: Ancient humans, driven from Sundaland by rising ocean waters or volcanic explosions, came into Mediterranean and fought with ancient Egyptians. (Plato’s story is completely correct.)  <br/>-*1200 BC: Ancient humans, from China-Taiwan, traveled to Indonesia, perhaps established a settlement near Krakatau, then went on to Africa (Madagascar), and then around Africa to the Mediterranean (Egypt). They fought with the Egyptians. This became documented on Nile river monuments where the Austronesians are dubbed the “Sea People.” (Plato wrongly ascribed an ancient date of 9000 BC, rather than circa 1200 BC.)<br/>-* 1200 BC: The Sea People came from inside the Mediterranean (perhaps Crete?). Plato ascribed a wrong date to the event (9000 BC) and a wrong geographical source (outside the Mediterranean) to the people. Plato confuses or blends together various stories of destruction (Thera, Krakatau), various civilizations, various times and creates a fascinating tale of an ideal society that gets destroyed.    <br/>-Of course various combinations of these three could be correct."    <br/>-<br/>-Prof. Santos also concludes that Atlantis is  really located in the Indo-Pacific Ocean, which was considered to be the eastward extension of the modern Atlantic Ocean, even though it is unlikely that knowledge of such a place could reach a place as far away as Egypt. The modern Atlantic Ocean was once deemed to extend all the way to the East Indies, a conception which lasted down to the times of Christopher Columbus and other Renaissance explorers and geographers. Despite the prevalent opinion of experts of all sorts that "continents cannot possibly sink" (see [[Isostasy]] theory), Prof. Santos managed to discover a whole sunken continent in the region of Indonesia, which he identifies with the Lost Continent of Atlantis, as can be seen in the detailed map published in Santos' Atlantis site. <br/>-<br/>-Prof. Santos identifies his Atlantis to Eden, the Judeo-Christian Paradise sunken in the Universal Flood. This event he dates at 11,600 BP [Before Present], the exact date of the catastrophic end of the last Pleistocene Ice Age, which also corresponds exactly to the date of Atlantis' demise as given by Plato and to the final sinking of Kumari Kandam, the sunken homeland of the Hindu Dravidas. Prof. Santos is presently planning an oceanographic expedition to the site in order to investigate several curious artefactual features he has already identified in the region he identifies with Atlantis-Eden.<br/>-<br/>-In February 2005, Canberra-based independent researcher Raimy Che-Ross, announced to the world that he had found a lost city in the unsunken Malaysian portion of the lost continent. A well funded expedition is now underway involving a large ground team of experts and [[Malaysia]] Centre For Remote Sensing (Macres) satellites. The Malaysian Department of Museums and Antiquities has been instructed to report their findings by August 2005. <small><sub>[http://202.186.86.35/special/lostcity/]</sub></small><br/>-<br/>-==== India and Sri Lanka ====<br/>-In [[South India]] and [[Sri Lanka]] there is a reputed "[[Kumari Kandam]]" (''kandam'' means  "continent" in [[Tamil language|Tamil]]), believed to be submerged under the sea. This continent is surrounded by legendary stories similar to those of  Atlantis. It has been called the "cradle of [[Dravidian]]s". Also, there have been some people linking the  "Kumari continent" to [[Lemuria]].<br/>-<br/>-In the [[Gulf of Cambay]], there is an archaeological submarine site of a former island named [[Dwaraka]], which is mainly associated with locations in Indian mythology (especially in the [[Mahabharata]]), which has also appeared in discussions about Atlantis. But its date (about 1,500 BC) is too recent to correspond to the real site of Atlantis, according to Plato's date of  9,600 BC.<br/>-<br/>-===Western hemisphere===<br/>-<br/>-Some investigators believe that Atlantis is in the Western hemisphere, which would have the location in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], near [[The Americas]], or at some of the surrounding islands. <br/>-<br/>-====Mid-Atlantic====<br/>-<br/>-When Plato spoke of the ''Ocean of Atlantis'', he may have been speaking of the ocean that we call ''Atlantic Ocean''. The [[ocean]]'s name, derived from [[Greek mythology]], means the "[[Sea]] of [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]]". Plato remarked that, in describing the origins of Atlantis, this area was allotted to Poseidon. Poseidon's first-born son was Atlas, who inheritted the kingdom, and passed it onto his firstborn for many generations.<br/>-<br/>-There is a prevalent opinion in scientific circles that "continents cannot possibly sink", delineated by the [[Isostasy]] theory. Geological studies of the mid-Atlantic fail to demonstrate that a large continent of Atlantis existed there. However, Atlantic Ocean [[geology]] does not exclude the possibility of a sunken [[island]]. If an island existed, it would have been much smaller than the island continent of [[Australia]]. [[Plato]] never claimed that a whole continent disappeared. He referenced a sunken island in front of another continent.<br/>-<br/>-====Azores Islands====<br/>-<br/>-One of the suggested places is that Atlantis is around the [[Azores Islands]] which are a group of islands belonging to Portugal located about 900 miles (1500 km) west of the Portuguese coast. Some people believe the islands could be the mountain tops of Atlantis.<br/>-<br/>-====Bahama Bank and Caribbean====<br/>-<br/>-Not all geologists deny the possibility of a sunken island in [[Central America]]. After the [[Charles Berlitz]] book ''[[The Mystery of Atlantis]]'', a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Hungary|Hungarian]] geologist-[[topography|topographer's]] book was published, entitled ''[[Atlantis: The Seven Seals]]''. The author, Z.A. Simon, called the attention to these controversies. He included some supporting conclusions of Dr. [[J. Manson Valentine]], [[M. Dmitri Ribikoff]], [[E. Umland]] and [[C. Umland]], [[Robert B. Stacy-Judd]], Dr. [[David Zink]], [[John P. Cohane]], [[Peter Tompkins]], [[Pino Turolla]], Captain Alexander, [[Francis Hitching]], [[James Bailey]], Dr. [[C.J. Cazeau]], Dr. [[S.D. Scott]], [[Brad Steiger]] and [[William R. Fix]].<br/>-<br/>-The June [[1981]] edition of ''Marine Geology'' shows some [[radiocarbon]] dates on [[mangrove]] [[peat]], based on the estimate of Broecker and Kulp, listing dates between [[5590 BC|5590]] and [[3680 BC]], with connection of the gradual sinking of the [[Florida]]&ndash;[[Bimini]] region. Most recently the rate of the [[sea level]]'s rise has slowed to 4.5 in (114 mm) per century. Prior to that time it was one foot per century. Near [[Andros Island]], underwater explorer [[Jacques-Yves Cousteau]] found a huge submerged cave 165 ft (50 m) beneath the surface. There are [[stalactites]] and [[stalagmites]] in it, that can be formed in the open air only. Marine sediments on the walls of the grotto enabled scientists to estimate its submersion around or after [[10,000 BC]]. The submarine topography of the [[Bahamas|Bahamian]] region shown in the huge [[Russia]]n ''Atlas Mira'' by detailed [[isobath]]s, catches the attention of a topographer. The sea floor on the northern side of [[Cuba]], [[Haiti]] and [[Puerto Rico]] indicates a definite system of submerged valleys of ancient rivers, combined with sunken mountain ranges. The "Tongue of the Ocean" at Andros Island is undoubtedly an underwater ravine caused by terrible tectonic forces, surrounded by almost vertical walls, as a "memento" of the catastrophe.  The main problem with this theory is that Atlantis was supposed to have submerged rapidly, following an earthquake.<br/>-<br/>-Z.A. Simon offers an "accurate" map of Plato's rectangular island with its given dimensions as 2,000 by 3,000 ''stadia'', overlaying its outline on the suspected ancient irregular shoreline of that traditional island in the Bahamas region. (An Attic stadium corresponds to 177.6 m)<br/>-<br/>-====Isla de la Juventud near Cuba====<br/>-<br/>-Recent underwater discoveries off the west coast of Cuba have led some to speculate on an Atlantean connection. However, even before these discoveries were announced, author Andrew Collins had explored the Cuba connection in a book titled "Gateway to Atlantis." Collins supports his hypothesis with a great deal of indirect but compelling historical and geographical evidence.

Under the command of Doctor Elizabeth Weir, an expedition team set out to find and explore this city and to find if there are any Ancients still living there. They discover the city on the sea floor of a largely oceanic planet, abandoned for ten thousand years. They later discover that the Ancients were defeated in a war with another race known as the Wraith, eventually retreating to Atlantis, hiding the city beneath the sea and, finally, returning to Earth through the city's Stargate. The Ancients who returned to Earth eventually mingled and interbred with the human population of the planet, giving rise to the legends of the city which sank beneath the sea.<br/>-* In the fourth season of ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'', the legend of Atlantis plays a major part in the plot. Granted, the version used isn't very accurate when compared to the real legend, but Atlantis is still used. In this season, called "The Doma Saga" by fans, an evil organization led by the previous King of Atlantis surfaces and tries to wipe out life on earth in order to create a new race of humans less evil and corrupt than the humans of today.<br/>-* Atlanteans are one threat that Aegis must deal with in the RPG [[Conspiracy X]].<br/>-* The setting of [[The Vision of Escaflowne]] was created by the Atlanteans.<br/>-* In [[Tolkien]]'s [[Akallabeth]], the island of [[Númenor]] is sunk because of the evil deeds of their inhabitants.

This eccentric character tells him that the Greek Gods of myth are real – and imprisoned on Atlantis – and only Dan can free them. Grief stricken and believing he has little else to live for – he decides to follow the self proclaimed deity's instructions and seeks out an archaeologist who is in search of the lost continent. What follows is an adventurous journey to Greece, Egypt, Spain and eventually – Atlantis itself. Along the way Dan battles with his own sanity, his relationship with God, an attraction to a young companion, sharks, pirates, murderers, an evil billionaire bent on finding Atlantis first, zombies, confusing clues, and the never-ending sarcasm of Hermes. All this – and they haven’t even gotten to the island nation yet – where awaiting them is something much, much worse.

They consist mostly of [[rookie]]s who were cut in training camps and borderline NFL-caliber players. Both rookies and young veterans are eligible for the practice squad. However, a player cannot participate on the practice squad for more than two seasons.  Practice squad players practice alongside regular roster players during the week; however they are not allowed to play in actual games. They are paid considerably less that active squad players ($4000 per week or $64,000 per season, in comparison to the NFL minimum rookie salary of $225,000). They are also ineligible for many fringe benefits such as service time, [[pensions]], and the like. They hope to be promoted to the active roster either by their current team, or by another team who is scouting them. They retain [[free agent]] status and may sign with any team they wish without compensation to the original team. Many are former college players living in the surrounding city area, and the vast majority of them are forced to take other jobs to help support themselves during the season and off-season. <br/> <br/>-[[Ali al-Dandachi]] served on the [[World Scout Committee]] of the World Organization of the Scout Movement from 1951 until 1957.

The diff is [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Manifold&diff=14073889&oldid=13927023 here].<br/>+<br/>+Let me summarize how the article changed (but I would request you read the diffs for yourselves). <br/>+<br/>+* Less emphasis is given on plain words and more on terminology: witness "near" vs "locally", "space" vs. "[[Euclidean space]] '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>". <br/>+**This is about the intro. I also added the intuitive view about gluing. "A general manifold can be obtained by gluing together open balls." --[[User:MarSch|MarSch]] 12:32, 25 May 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::: What you added is mathematically correct. However, a nonmathematician will think upon reading this that a manifold looks like a stack of oranges in a grocery store. But that was a good attempt, and I think I know how to improve on it. [[User:Oleg Alexandrov|Oleg Alexandrov]] 00:01, 26 May 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+* More emphasis is given, right from the introduction on applications of manifolds to  [[classical mechanics]], mentioned are in the second pararaph [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]s, and how they work  to model [[spacetime]] in [[general relativity]].<br/>+**this stuff I moved to the intro, because I think it is important to explain why manifolds are interesting.<br/>+<br/>+::: I did not say what you did was wrong. I just summarized your edits. Now, to mention just several issues, more immediate ones like [[relativity]] was enough. No need for two sentences about configuration spaces and other things. [[User:Oleg Alexandrov|Oleg Alexandrov]] 00:01, 26 May 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+* The intuitive discussion about "Intrinsic versus extrinsic" has been shortened. <br/>+** Yes, I removed some lines which I deemed vague and also didn't make this a subheading of history since it isn't.--[[User:MarSch|MarSch]] 12:32, 25 May 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::: The notions of "intrinsic" and "extrinsic" are very important and very hard to explain nonmathematically. That paragraph did a very good job with that. I am very sad you did not appreciate that and decided to cut it down. [[User:Oleg Alexandrov|Oleg Alexandrov]] 00:01, 26 May 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+* [[Chart]]s and [[transition map]]s have been given more prominence, as well as the symbol C<sup>k</sup>. <br/>+**Instead of spelling out the definition of chart a couple of times I thought it better to define it once. This allowed me to clean up the definition of topological manifold considerably. I have used Ck where appropriate in formal definitions. --[[User:MarSch|MarSch]] 12:32, 25 May 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::: When I write a math paper, I do exactly that. However, by making things more formal and putting the heavy definitons upfront, you made the whole thing much harder to understand. To be concise and rigurous is good in a math paper or book, not when you write an essay. [[User:Oleg Alexandrov|Oleg Alexandrov]] 00:01, 26 May 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+* The fact that a manifold is Hausdorff has been emphasised.<br/>+**This is simply not true. I have used Hausdorffness in the definition just as the older version did. Actually I moved the discussion about Hausdorffness to a separate heading, maybe that is what you mean.--[[User:MarSch|MarSch]] 12:32, 25 May 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:: That's what I mean. You replaced two sentences in two places with an entire section. Now, I am aware that the Hausdofness assumption is very important, and most differential geometry will not hold without it. But again, to put more value on this technicality than on the intuitive explanation of intrinsic and extrinsic is not good in an article aimed at the level of say college students. [[User:Oleg Alexandrov|Oleg Alexandrov]] 00:01, 26 May 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+* I am not sure I understand the sentence:<br/>+::A '''topological ''n''-manifold''' is a [[Hausdorff space]] in which every point ''p'' is in the interior or in the boundary.<br/>+**"At each point in the interior there is an Rn-chart and at each point in the boundary there is an R0+×Rn-1-chart." Explains what they are. I agree that the formulation can be improved here.--[[User:MarSch|MarSch]] 12:32, 25 May 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::: What you wrote before was plainly incorrect. The expanded explanation is correct. But I would not insist so early on manifolds with boundary. The previous version of the article wisely talked about it later. [[User:Oleg Alexandrov|Oleg Alexandrov]] 00:01, 26 May 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:::: Again this is simply not the case. The old article started with a '''topological manifold with boundary''' and I have simply preserved it. I agree that it might be a good idea to change this. I wish you would take a better look at what was _really_ in the old version and not simply assume that I changed things for the worse. --[[User:MarSch|MarSch]] 10:18, 26 May 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::::: Well, not quite. In the article, there was first the section "Technical definition" which had a lot of wording without mentioning boundary. After that, you are right, the topological manifold did talk about boundary. But then, later, in the section ==differential manifold== one again does not deal with the boundary. And that is a very long and well written section. When you rewrote the article however, you merged together a lot of the things in ==topologica manifold== and in ==differential manifold== and now the boundary was present everywhere. [[User:Oleg Alexandrov|Oleg Alexandrov]] 15:15, 26 May 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+Can I say the new version is certainly bad? Probably no. Is it more rigurous and stresses more on heavy use of manifolds in math and physics? Yes. Is it more understandable for non-specialists? No. Is this article still a fine encyclopedic essay? Maybe, but worse than before. I would like to discuss if we maybe could move to the older version.<br/>+<br/>+And I couple of words about MarSch. MarSch is a very smart guy, knowing lots of differential geometry, and probably many other things. MarSch is a very bold guy, having rewritten such a prominent article as [[mathematics]] (I did not see how it went), and MarSch desired to edit the main Wikipedia page, but lacked administrative powers to do that. MarSch has very good technical skills, and likes the technical parts to be more prominent in articles (there was a discussion right here about [[Laplace operator]). My own view is that MarSch needs to still absorb a bit more the existing culture on Wikipedia before making drastic changes. [[User:Oleg Alexandrov|Oleg Alexandrov]] 19:16, 22 May 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:Sigh. Agree with Oleg. Maybe '''be not so terribly bold''' would be a better byword. I guess WP has no formal process for "Vote For Reversion"? [[User:Linas|linas]] 03:36, 23 May 2005 (UTC)<br/>+:: That would be going to the talk page and bringing it up there ;) [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 10:26, 23 May 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:I am surprised, again, that someone dislikes my edits so much that they want to revert them completely. I have tried to improve the logic and structure of the article, thereby hoping to make it more accessible to all and I like to think I succeeded. I have responded to the few objections Oleg mentioned above, but please take a look at the changes for yourself. --[[User:MarSch|MarSch]] 12:32, 25 May 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:: MarSch, I will try my best not to be confrontational. But you see, in a sence you are not giving me a choice. You did a thorugh rewriting of a very prominent math article, much rewritten and much discussed before. And you did so without any consultation on the article's talk page. <br/>+<br/>+:: I did not say your contributions are overall bad. I just don't know how to harmonize what you wrote with what was before. I will not do it now, but I plan to revert to the old version of [[manifold]], then we can work together to improve on it with the changes being done gradually and discussed in advance on the talk page. [[User:Oleg Alexandrov|Oleg Alexandrov]] 00:01, 26 May 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::: I think the biggest problem though is the way you and me view things. You seem to be writing for the fellow mathematician who knows at least as much as you about the given subject. I try to write for the general public, for the level of college students. I have six years of teaching experience as teaching assistant and lecturer, and I think I can safely say that no college student will understand much of [[manifold]] the way it is now written. [[User:Oleg Alexandrov|Oleg Alexandrov]] 00:06, 26 May 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::::I think this discussion should really continue on [[Talk:Manifold]]. If the biggest problem is the discussion of 'atlases' - my guess - then we can apply the usual idea of having a less formal discussion on the Manifold page, and full technical details on [[atlas (topology)]], with a ''See main article ...'' link to it. [[User:Charles Matthews|Charles Matthews]] 15:28, 26 May 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+moved my comment down --[[User:MarSch|MarSch]] 17:14, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+== Recent changes ==<br/>+<br/>+Lost in the debate was my primary objections to MarSch's edits. First was cutting the "intrinsic vs extrinsic part"; that still to be discussed. The second was the "cleanup" taken by MarSch as result of which charts were defined first and the treatment of topological manifolds and differential manifolds were rather combined. Now I reverted that to the way it was before. More work is needed, but this is a better starting point. [[User:Oleg Alexandrov|Oleg Alexandrov]] 21:27, 26 May 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:I stared at the article a bit more and I do like the old version better. It flows. Whereas, in MarSch's edits the stuff about charts seemd suoperfluous (its already wikilinked to the right article), and the topology discussion got interrupted by statements about differentiability before moving back to topology.  However, the article does have problems, I'll list below.   (Sorry to take so long to respond. I've gotten hopelessly tangled in stupid VfD issues, see [[Harmonics theory]]. I normally run away from controversy. Sigh.) [[User:Linas|linas]] 05:10, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+==Charts== <br/>+I would like to see [[Atlas (topology)]] expanded; the layman's intro is good, but a good mathematical definition would be a lot better.  e.g. a discussion of the transition functions, and a discussion of the [[Jacobi identity]]-like thing  (the Bianchi identity-like thing?) or whatever its called where you have three open sets intersecting, and the charts have to be three-way consistent.  Maybe MarSch could apply himself there?  [[User:Linas|linas]] 05:35, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:I concur.  The detailed material on atlases is better placed in the separate [[Atlas (topology)|atlas]] article where they can be given a thorough treatment without interrupting the flow of this article.  I suggest perhaps using the section called "Additional structures and generalizations" to (briefly!) give a description of differentiable manifolds, and then a link to a separate article: [[differentiable manifolds]].  My view is that we should relegate all additional structures not present in the basic definition of topological manifolds to separate articles. - [[User:Gauge|Gauge]] 04:11, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:: I propose to wait moving everything to a separate article until the sections here get "too big", and not because of lack of headings. Since we need to summarize these articles here anyway I see little point in splitting of things which are too small to summarize. --[[User:MarSch|MarSch]] 11:49, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+== The empty manifold ==<br/>+<br/>+Should we allow (topological) manifolds to be empty? The current definition does allow this, but is contradicted by the following paragraph. The classification of 1-manifolds further down the page assumes they are nonempty, and there are other articles that also assume manifolds are nonempty. The only statement I have seen that relies on empty manifolds is the one about the boundary of an n-manifold being an an (n-1)-manifold. --[[User:Zundark|Zundark]] 16:25, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:Not sure, but I think we should allow it. Don't know what it's dimension would be, though. --[[User:MarSch|MarSch]] 11:55, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::It's a manifold of every dimension, since every point has an open neighbourhood homeomorphic to '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> for every non-negative integer ''n''. But its [[covering dimension]] is -1. I think we should disallow it. --[[User:Zundark|Zundark]], 5 Jun 2005<br/>+<br/>+:::Okay, maybe we should disallow it. Unfortunately this means that a manifold without boundary is not a special case of a manifold with boundary. --[[User:MarSch|MarSch]] 16:50, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::::No, a manifold without boundary would still be a manifold with boundary, since we would disallow the empty manifold in both cases. Perhaps what you meant to say is that the boundary of a manifold may not be a manifold (because it may be empty) - this is what I was referring to above in my 1 June comment. --[[User:Zundark|Zundark]] 08:09, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:::::You are entirely correct. --[[User:MarSch|MarSch]] 09:39, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+==Misc article problems==<br/>+Article states: ''(Readers should see the topology glossary for definitions of topological terms used in this article.)''  Can we cut this sentence out? [[User:Linas|linas]] 05:23, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:This was added before we had articles on the individual terms. It's no longer needed, so I've removed it. --[[User:Zundark|Zundark]] 09:39, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+==Hausdorff==<br/>+Article states: ''...it is tempting to think that being locally homeomorphic to a Euclidean space implies being a Hausdorff space. A counterexample is created by deleting zero from the real line and replacing it with two points, an open neighborhood of either of which includes all nonzero numbers in some open interval centered at zero. This construction, called the real line with two origins is not Hausdorff, because the two origins cannot be separated.''<br/>+<br/>+These sentences seem to imply that the "real line with two origins" is homeomorphic to the real line.  It is not clear that it is, or that it isn't. Wording should be fixed. [[User:Linas|linas]] 05:23, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+==[[Volume form]]==<br/>+Just an idea, but maybe the article should provide a few sentances on [[differential geometry]] and [[calculus on manifolds]], maybe mentioning that a manifold has concepts of [[volume form|area and volume]]? [[User:Linas|linas]] 06:06, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:Well, it doesn't really. [[User:Charles Matthews|Charles Matthews]] 10:07, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+:To be pedantic, what a smooth manifold has is a class of ''Lebesgue measures'', such that every diffeomorphism leaves the ''class'' invariant. So volume forms are defined up to smooth invertible functions. But that's not the same as having a preferred volume form. [[User:Charles Matthews|Charles Matthews]] 12:49, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::Didn't mean to suggest there is a natural volume form; what I'm trying to suggest is that half the stuff in the section on ''differentiable manifolds'' should be moved to the article on charts, and that instead a paragraph or two should be added on calculus on manifolds.  Surely a mention of calculus on manifolds is more important and interesting that ''algebra of scalars'' which is neat and all that but of somewhat lower priority.  Since we appear not have a [[calculus on manifolds]] article, I figured that at a bare minimum, the article on [[volume form]] is at least not embarassingly thin and thus linkable. Also, adding your pedantic defn. above to the article seems maybe worthwhile. I dunno. [[User:Linas|linas]] 06:25, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:I think you mean to mention things like [[Differential form]]s and [[tensor field]]s and I agree. --[[User:MarSch|MarSch]] 12:01, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+==Algebra of scalars==<br/>+Wording needs to be fixed and clarified. ''For a Ck manifold M, you can form the Ck functions to the real or complex numbers.'' What does "..to the.." mean?  Which Ck functions are these? Are these the charts? Are these some other functions defned on the manifold? Its known that the set of scalar-valued functions on a manifold form an algebra, is that what this paragraph is talking about? [[User:Linas|linas]] 06:06, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:The functions with ''k'' derivatives, basically: see [[smooth function]]. The ''k''th derivative is assumed continuous. [[User:Charles Matthews|Charles Matthews]] 10:06, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:: The sentence above is indeed mathematically correct, but I would say not well worded. It is not whether "you can form" the functions; they exist whether you want it or not. And indeed, saying "to the reals" sounds clumsy, better say "real-valued". I modified this in the article, wonder how it looks now. [[User:Oleg Alexandrov|Oleg Alexandrov]] 14:55, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::: Thanks Oleg. Charles, due to the recent edit controversy, I just thought I'd jot down a list of to-do cleanup items for this article; the questions were rhetorical. [[User:Linas|linas]] 06:17, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+==[[Algebraic variety]]==<br/>+Should this article mention (probably in the "see also" section) [[algebraic variety]] ?  Or at least [[algebraic geometry]]? [[User:Linas|linas]] 06:06, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+:At least in the see also section algebraic variety. Don't know about alg. geom. --[[User:MarSch|MarSch]] 11:51, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+==Algebra of scalars==<br/>+<br/>+I find this section in the article not very helpful. I mean, all the other sections talk about really important concepts about manifolds (tangent space, classification); this one I think is a minor thing, and I belive we could be better off without it. Comments? [[User:Oleg Alexandrov|Oleg Alexandrov]] 16:52, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:Agreed.  It seems out of place here as a separate section. - [[User:Gauge|Gauge]] 04:16, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+I put this in here, because of the possibility to recover from the algebra of scalars the manifold itself. Unfortunately I don't know very much about this yet, specifically under what conditions this is possible. Also another def of the tangent bundle is as derivations on the algebra of scalars. In that way it is more basic than the tangent bundle, so I think that this is also "really important".<br/>+<br/>+As an aside: It is the Wikipedia way to try to preserve all information. Even if you think something of minor importance, you should try to preserve it. Please try to be a bit more carefull in your suggestions about "things we can do without". --[[User:MarSch|MarSch]] 11:36, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+: You can preserve that information, but in a different place. As you said, you don't know how to expand that section, or how to explain its significance. So for now, we are better off without it. [[User:Oleg Alexandrov|Oleg Alexandrov]] 15:17, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::I _have_ just explained its significance. You can stick a sect-stub on it if you want. --[[User:MarSch|MarSch]] 16:47, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::Actually this section is also a prerequisite for the exterior calculus that linas wants to add, since these are the 0-forms. --[[User:MarSch|MarSch]] 16:54, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+==solving things==<br/>+I would like to alert some editors to this template, which expresses the beliefs of a lot of wikipediansa about technical details:<br/>+{{technical}}<br/>+That said, I would like to start trying to sort out our differences. Therefore I will start simple. <br/>+<br/>+===Charts===<br/>+*I think that a good article on manifolds should not ignore charts.[[User:MarSch|MarSch]]<br/>+: I thought the section ==Differentiable manifolds== mentions charts in the right place. Where else would you want them? [[User:Oleg Alexandrov|Oleg Alexandrov]] 16:47, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+::topological manifolds also have charts. Transition maps are automatically homeomorphism. There is stuff we can say about charts and we should make a section for that. When it grows too large we can split off some to the article about charts, but we are not there yet. Charts are also "really important". --[[User:MarSch|MarSch]] 11:40, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+===More headings===<br/>+*For ease of future editing and also searching, I like to use headings for important subsubjects. This helps give an article structure. Please comment on this. --[[User:MarSch|MarSch]] 12:01, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+: Perfectly agree. So far, this article uses 11 headings. Would you be specific where more heading would be needed, and how they should be called? I can see that the section ==Differentiable manifolds== is kind of long; but not very long, one screen and a bit on my computer, and things there flow nicely without headings. So, just please be more specific. [[User:Oleg Alexandrov|Oleg Alexandrov]] 16:52, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:: I dislike all the loose facts about manifolds which are thrown haphazardly either into the topological or the differentiable heading. I would like those to be collected under new headings and keep the def in its own heading. Also the bit of explanation about Hausdorffness needs to be isolated so that it can be improved. It is so much easier to edit small sections than large ones, since you have less to worry about. If we want to link to chart and atlas as subarticles, I think we should also give each of those a heading. If they deserve an article than they definately deserve a heading... --[[User:MarSch|MarSch]] 17:34, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::: OK, let us figure this out piece by piece. <br/>+<br/>+::: I wonder, which loose facts you mean. So far, this article has two important sections, the section about topological manifolds, and then the section on differential manifolds, which are like topological manifolds, and in addition have smooth charts and transition maps. This structure makes perfect sence to me. <br/>+<br/>+::::You can see what I want by looking at the article before you did a partial revert[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Manifold&oldid=14282278#Why_require_Hausdorffness]. The loose facts are under "Homogenous, second-countable and paracompact". A lot of the section "diff manif" is about charts. Actually it is more than half of it. --[[User:MarSch|MarSch]] 12:17, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::: I don't see what to improve about the Hausdorfness. It has its own paragraph, and is rather well explained. Are you implying you need a heading called ==Hausdorfness== only for one paragraph? I think that would make things too fragmented. And that paragraph is in proper place, where the topological issues are discussed, before moving on to the differential structure. <br/>+:::: Yes, I am implying that we need ====Hausdoffness==== or some such. We can say a whole lot more about it. Also linas doesn't think the example is so clearly explained. I don't see how it fragments things. This could grow into a new article on non-Hausdorff manifolds.--[[User:MarSch|MarSch]] 12:17, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::: Again, at least to me, the two sections "Topological manifolds" and "Differential manifolds"  make perfect sence, as the latter builds on the former. Could you be more specific what exactly you don't like about the current arrangement? [[User:Oleg Alexandrov|Oleg Alexandrov]] 23:39, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:::: PS If I did not address some other concerns you mentioned, I will. Let us take things piece by piece. [[User:Oleg Alexandrov|Oleg Alexandrov]] 23:39, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+===proposed combined and further expanded new definition===<br/>+I have tried to integrate the chart-def with the homeomorphic neighborhood-def and also tried to explain the defs more. See below:<br/>+<br/>+'''Topological manifold without boundary'''<br/>+<br/>+The prototypical example of a topological manifold without boundary is Euclidean space. A general manifold without boundary looks locally, as a topological space, like Euclidean space. This is formalized by requiring that a manifold without boundary is a topological space in which every point has an open neighbourhood homeomorphic to (an open subset of) Rn. Another way of saying this, using charts, is that a manifold without boundary is a topological space in which at every point there is an Rn-chart.<br/>+<br/>+'''Topological manifold with boundary'''<br/>+<br/>+More generally it is possible to allow a topological manifold to have a boundary. The prototypical example of a topological manifold with boundary is Euclidean half-space. Most points in Euclidean half-space, those not on the boundary, have a neighbourhood homeomorphic to Euclidean space in addition to having a neighbourhood homeomorphic to Euclidean half-space, but the points on the boundary only have neighbourhoods homeomorphic to Euclidean half-space and not to Euclidean space. Thus we need to allow for two kinds of points in our topological manifold with boundary: points in the interior and points in the boundary. Points in the interior will, as before, have neighbourhoods homeomorphic to Euclidean space, but may also have neighbourhoods homeomorphic to Euclidean half-space. Points in the boundary will have neighbourhoods homeomorphic to Euclidean half-space. Thus a topological manifold with is a topological space in which at each point there is an Rn-chart or an R0+×Rn-1-chart. The set of points at which there are only R0+×Rn-1-charts is called the boundary and its complement is called the interior.<br/>+<br/>+*What do you think of this? --[[User:MarSch|MarSch]] 17:13, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+: Basically, this extends the section "Topological manifolds". Overall does not look too bad. But let us clarify first the overall article structure. I still think the split into "Topological manifolds" and "differential manifolds" is the right one. After we discuss that (see above) we can come to this. <br/>+<br/>+:By the way, the section about "topological manifold with boundary" is rather long. In my view, we better have the section about "topological manifolds" without mentioning boundary at all, then the section "differential manifolds" again without mentioning the boundary, and only later a new heading in which the boundary is discussed. [[User:Oleg Alexandrov|Oleg Alexandrov]] 23:46, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::If we were to go with my suggestion of splitting off nearly all of the content on differentiable manifolds to a separate article, these additions would be a great way to elaborate upon the definition of topological manifolds.  I think that the distinction between manifolds with/without boundary is very important, and as such they should be treated separately without favoring one over the other.  In particular, this means that I prefer the headings "Topological manifolds without boundary" and "Topological manifolds with boundary" instead of the former being the "default" definition.  - [[User:Gauge|Gauge]] 04:25, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+== new recent changes ==<br/>+<br/>+I think the thing Oleg and linas didn't like about my previous changes was that I removed the section titled '''technical description'''. I've removed the sentence about what follows below, because that is not usefull at all. I think this section is very bad. It is not technical which it claims. It includes some history and some other random facts. Can we relocate all info and then delete this then empty section?<br/>+<br/>+I've found two subsections which Oleg deleted by doing his partial revert. I've put them back. This does not mean that I want these as they are now, but we shouldn't be throwing the info out.  The first is the section on Hausdorffness. Since Hausdorffness is no longer in the core def we might want to mention that most mathematicians do include Hausdorffness in the def. And second-countability also maybe? Not sure. The other section is random facts on (diff.) manifolds, ah I see there something about 2nd countability.<br/>+<br/>+I've put in the expanded def. on topological manifolds. We should probably have something similar for diff. manifolds. Both a def with substitutions of subdefs and a short def. We should collect all random facts into either the section about topo or about diff manifolds. It will probably turn out that diff manifold could be split off. Maybe we should also split topo manifold off. We could then expand on some more general manifolds like the Banach and Frechet manifolds. Maybe a section for Lie groups. And of course a section about complex manifolds. Also needed is the canonical picture for clarifying what a transition map is. Tell me what you think --[[User:MarSch|MarSch]] 14:45, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:The common assumptions between the various possible definitions are as follows:  we always require a manifold to be a kind of topological space with second-countability, but not always Hausdorff (although I'd never heard of a non-Hausdorff manifold before seeing the foliation example).  All of the definitions also require that a manifold is locally (complex or real Euclidean, or Banach space, Hilbert space, etc), and we also require the notion of transition maps.  It seems to me that a very general definition could use bundle-theoretic methods.  In particular, perhaps the fibres could be viewed as torsors for the various linear groups?  This, however, would be quite abstract to newcomers.  Perhaps we should direct newcomers to pages treating more specific types of manifolds before trying to understand this (necessarily very abstract and general) page?  Or perhaps make a separate page giving the more general definition, whatever it may be?  - [[User:Gauge|Gauge]] 21:56, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:: The concept of manifold is indeed a complex one. And recently I started understanding the motivation behind MarSch's changes. There is a tradeoff between keeping an article acessible, and making it more concise/general/rigurous/complete. MarSch seems to be leaning against the latter, and above, Gauge seems to be leaning in the same direction. <br/>+<br/>+:: However, since this is an encyclopedia, I think one should lean towards acessibility at the expence of the other things. There are lots of good books in differential geometry out there, but there are not many accessible essays not directed towards the fellow mathematician who knows at least as much as the author abut a given subject. <br/>+<br/>+:: And by the way, since people in general have diverse opinions about how a given article should look like, I suggest that any big changes to a math article be discussed in advance on the talk page. In this way we will avoid the recent debacle with this article. I acknowlege that some of it was also due to my impatience, but a preliminary discussion would have saved lots of energy spent arguing. [[User:Oleg Alexandrov|Oleg Alexandrov]]<br/>+<br/>+:I am in favor of making this page the "more accessible" one.  It seems to me that a casual user would just want to know about the most commonly-used definition, namely real or complex finite-dimensional manifolds that have the nice topological properties such as the Hausdorff property.  However, I also think that we should have another article (or articles) treating more general cases and giving more technical details.  This scaling-up of technical difficulty is necessary due to the widely-varying backgrounds of our audience.  We should be able to come up with something that will make everyone (newcomers and experts alike) happy. -  [[User:Gauge|Gauge]] 04:16, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:: I would not mind having another more technical article in addition to [[manifold]]. I think  Charles suggested above that some of the more technical issues could be discussed at [[atlas (topology)]]. Or somewhere else. Any suggestions? [[User:Oleg Alexandrov|Oleg Alexandrov]] 04:57, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::: I would like this article to be technically complete and also start with a description (which should read like a popular science book) for non-mathematicians This would also be highly interesting to mathematicians and physicists. It should explain how to visualize manifolds, as in the bit about exterior and interior viewpoints, elaborate on the gluing which is mentioned in the intro and generally use our geometrical intuition to clarify the why of manifolds. But the absence of that is no reason to start culling the rigorous mathematics. For the more mathematically knowledgeable the rigorous definition should be explained as clearly as possible and as simply as possible, but without excluding things merely because they are too technical that are very relevant to this article. I see these two things as complementary and mutually reinforcing. I hope we can work to improve both, but I find "hiding things away" in separate articles a simplistic "solution". --[[User:MarSch|MarSch]] 12:35, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:::: I disagree with making this article more technically complete. [[User:Oleg Alexandrov|Oleg Alexandrov]] 15:32, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:::: I completely agree with Oleg. Manifold is a basic article which will be read by a lot of people with different backgrounds. It should be as accessible as possible. By making the article technically more complete we make it less accessible. "Hiding" technical details and complex issues in different articles is exactly the right way (in my opinion) to improve the article.  [[User:MathMartin|MathMartin]] 16:10, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::::: So what you're saying is that if you add a technical paragraph at the end of an article, without changing anything else, you have just made the article less accessible? You can't be serious, these things are independent/orthogonal. --[[User:MarSch|MarSch]] 13:44, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:::: I was away during the recent flurry of edits, so I don't know all the background. My opinion is as folows: I'd like this article to talk about nice manifolds, and include some examples and pictures. I think that that will make the article long enough. At the end, we can include a section on generalizations: relaxing conditions like Hausdorff and second countable, infinite dimensions, complex manifolds, etc. If possible, we can also include a definition there which covers all generalizations, but the section on generalizations should not be more than say one screenful. Splitting the article in [[topological manifold]], [[differential manifold]], etc. and "hiding" things away seems a good approach here. -- [[User:Jitse Niesen|Jitse Niesen]] 16:35, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::I agree with Oleg, MathMartin, and Jitse. In particular I like the idea of separate articles for "topological manifold" and "differentiable manifold" that include all of the more technical details.  I suggest "Abstract manifold" as an article name for the most general definitions.  What are manifolds called when they have atlases of Banach spaces?  - [[User:Gauge|Gauge]] 19:08, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:::Yes I also agree with putting the technical details in such separate articles, but what about the technical non-details? --[[User:MarSch|MarSch]] 13:48, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::::It is okay to mention technical non-details, so long as they are ''not'' elaborated upon in this article.

We need to be more specific. Here is a proposal of how I'd like to see the page:<br/>+* '''Lead section''', '''History''', '''Intrinsic and extrinsic view'''. Essentially as it is now.<br/>+* '''Examples''': New section, mentioning circle, sphere and perhaps torus, possibly with application (manifolds as configuration space or phase space).<br/>+* '''Technical description'''. Essentially as it is now.<br/>+* '''Charts'''. Delete as a separate section from this article.<br/>+* '''Topological manifolds''', '''Differentiable manifolds'''. Summarize to say two paragraphs each, devolving the rest to separate articles. Perhaps add a section on ''Riemannian manifolds''.<br/>+* '''Tangent space''', '''Algebra of scalars''', '''Classification of manifolds'''. Move to new article on ''differentiable manifolds''.<br/>+* '''Additional structures and generalizations'''. Essentially as it is now.<br/>+Comments? -- [[User:Jitse Niesen|Jitse Niesen]] 21:07, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+I like very much wat Jitse suggests. Pictures needed! I can make pictures like the one in [[level set method]], but I don't know if that's the best style. Anyway, what kind of pictures to put? [[User:Oleg Alexandrov|Oleg Alexandrov]] 02:51, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:What exactly do you mean by this point "* '''Topological manifolds''', '''Differentiable manifolds'''. Summarize to say two paragraphs each."? What ''kind'' of info do you want to keep? <br/>+:Since every article on a specific kind of manifold needs to talk about charts and transition maps I see no possibility to remove this section. This is not a technical detail, but an essential part of manifold theory. For a topological manifold you don't need to make any restrictions on the transition maps, so could theoretically ignore them, but I think it is worth mentioning that they are automatically homeomorphisms, even though this is trivial, For a differentiable manifold you cannot ignore them, so I wonder what you want to keep in that section. Not the definition apparently. I think the examples section is a great idea and I think level set-like picture would be nice.  --[[User:MarSch|MarSch]] 11:15, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+Charts are introduced in ''Technical description'', and we can discuss them more fully in [[chart (topology)]] or perhaps [[topological manifold]]. I agree that charts are essential in manifold theory, but I do not want much manifold ''theory'' in the article. I am undecided as of yet whether we want any definitions of topological and differentiable manifolds in the article, or whether this would complicate things too much. I will hopefully find time to flesh it out a bit more later, but for the first paragraph of differentiable manifolds, I am thinking along the lines of the current first paragraph, which goes "It is easy to define the notion of a topological manifold, but it is very hard to work with this object. The smooth manifold defined below works better for most applications, in particular it makes possible to apply "calculus" on the manifold." -- [[User:Jitse Niesen|Jitse Niesen]] 12:26, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+: I agree with Jitse that there is no point in discussing much the heavy machinery. We don't want an article which only differential geometers will understand. Nice pictures and intuitive explanations will drive the point home much better than all those charts, Housdorff issues and algebras of scalars combined. [[User:Oleg Alexandrov|Oleg Alexandrov]] 16:01, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::I like this plan also.  As for charts, I think we should just mention that they are needed to give rigorous definitions for specific types of manifolds, and defer the actual definition to another article.  -[[User:Gauge|Gauge]] 01:51, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:Charts are _mentioned_ in the technical description. They are not introduced nor even decsribed. The word is used, but nothing more. <br/>+:I think I could agree with the proposal to split. I propose to split off everything on differentiable manifolds. Please leave the section on charts and transition maps for now, so as not to break the def of topological manifolds. We can discuss what to do with that later. --[[User:MarSch|MarSch]] 12:47, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+I had a wee go at it last night, but it is not easy. You can see my efforts in [[User:Jitse Niesen/sandbox]]. It's very much work in progress, but you're free to edit. Actually, I now think that charts and transition maps should be described, as they are not difficult concepts. We might be able to steal some pictures from the Japanese article at [[ja:&#22810;&#27096;&#20307;]]. -- [[User:Jitse Niesen|Jitse Niesen]] ([[User talk:Jitse Niesen|talk]]) 13:00, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+I just want to warn you not to hold your breath.

Let us keep some appearances here; the article page should look like a polished page and not some scratch pad. I put the alert box on this talk page.

However, I am very doubtful you will get any new feedback that way. You should go after the people who already have this page on their watchlist, and who commented above. Besides, if a visitor runs into [[manifold]], and does not bother to take a look at its talk page, it is unlikely that person will be very helpful with rewriting the article.<br/>+<br/>+:: I am removing the notice again, being on the talk page is enough.

My "Rescuers Down Under" and "Fantasia" videos from 1991 have the red FBI logos.<br/>-<br/>-** I dunno what that was about, maybe it was an expriment, my Robin Hood print has the red FBI logos.<br/>-<br/>-1998-2000- Similar to the 1998 warning, but the font is a bit different.<br/>-<br/>-2001- Blue, seen on all WDHE releases of today.<br/>-<br/>-*The early home video (1980-83) warnings had a blue background with a yellow arial font (used with the original videotape releases with the general covers)- I finally saw it- it looks very vintage- after the animated logo, the MPAA rating displays in blue and white before the film. The first warning is "FOR SALE ONLY NOT INTENDED FOR RENTAL.<br/>-<br/>-List your favorite animated logos and your least favorite logos-<br/>-<br/>-I used to hate the 1987 home video logo. (I dunno why, it was scary)<br/>-<br/>-== Other Facts ==<br/>-<br/>-I have an early print of The Three Caballeros, but I don't know when it came out, it plays the 1987 Home video logo, although a website known as magicalears.com said it was 1982, and the stock number is 091, a low one (for instance, Dumbo, 024). Another thing is that after that 87 logo came out, videos were packed in carboard boxes, do you know when this came out? I am assuming 1988. This also occurs on the Mary Poppins video (which I've seen in images), was this basically an experiment?-<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-I Finally figured out that the 82 video release was a general release, my print is probably 1987 or 1988.<br/>-<br/>-* Disney videos always had low stock numbers in the 80s. I am sure the "Three Caballeros" video came out in 1987 or 1988. <br/>-<br/>-I became a WDHV nut in 2002, because I looked at the video covers and the previews and the animated logos, so I did some research watching each tape. I had a few Classics releases in my library, most of which where the Masterpiece releases. A relative lend me his videos, and I watched the "Classics" editions of Cinderella and Bambi, and had previews for Oliver and Mermaid. I said to myself,"These came out in the late 1980s." I thought the division started in 1987 or 1988. Then I saw the 1986 Alice print, and saw the cheesy logo, and I said,"This must be old." I kinda dropped this info and recouped it in 2005, then I became a huge nut and I'm now collecting, how long have you been a fan of Walt Disney Videos?<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-Out of all of Disney's features released on video from 1980 to 1983, why wasn't Snow White first and not Dumbo?<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-If I am not mistaking, Pinocchio (1984) is the first video to have coming attractions for The Black Cauldron, am I false.<br/>-<br/>--I read this on a thread of messages on The Big Cartoon Database.<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-A strange occurence happens when I watch (and used to) the 101 Dalmatians 1992 cassette, at the very end, there are previews for 2 Disney videos, has this happened to you? Same thing with Great Mouse Detective and Beauty and the Beast. Although a page on this site says that these end previews occured on the 80s tapes.<br/>-<br/>-* I once rented the 1992 101 Dalmatians video, and it had previews for "The Great Mouse Detective" and "Beauty and the Beast" at the end. the "Beauty" video has a preview for the "101 Dalmatians" video after the film.<br/>-<br/>-Disney stopped releasing Beta releases in 1992, am I right? because I saw The Rescuers in Beta format.<br/>-<br/>-The Classics print logo on the article page questions me, what cover did you scan it from? At first I thought it was Pinocchio, but I got the release, and the red line at the top isn't up there, what release was it?<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-- I couldn't be any of them, I have all of the 7 old editions and they don't have it, it was probably a promotional card inside a catalogue. <br/>-<br/>--- Yes, I scanned it off a WDHV brochure from 1989 that came in my Bambi videocassette off of eBay.<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-BTW, you can also tell a Disney video apart by its label. 80s Disney videotapes were easy to distinguish because the VHS videocassettes had large white labels, which were "all-purpose" so they could be used on Beta tapes, too. The 1980-1986 labels for the regular WDHV series (the ones that had "Neon Mickey") had two designs: One had a picture of Sorcerer Mickey standing next to "Walt Disney Home Video" logo between blue lines, and another had Mickey and a oddly-arranged version of the WDHV text between orange and yellow lines. In 1987, it was switched to simple a picture of Sorcerer Mickey and the WDHV logo. No borders or anything. Videos in the Mini-Classics series had a tiny M-C print logo above the title, with the Mickey/WDHV text in the center.<br/>-The Walt Disney Classics videos of 1984 to 1989 also had large labels, except they were more simple, and besides the FBI info and the movie title, it had the Black Diamond "THE CLASSICS Walt Disney Home Video" print logo on it, too. This can be found on all Disney Classic tapes with the Cheesy Black Diamond logo, but it is also seen on "Cinderella" and "Bambi," which use the 1988 Classics logo!<br/>-The Cartoon Classics series had its custom print logo in the center of the label.<br/>-<br/>-* Yes I know that, some videotapes in 1991 had labels like the Mini-Classics. I am also well aware of the labels in the regular WDHV. <br/>-<br/>-How big will this page be in the future?<br/>-<br/>-== Making this page big- ==<br/>-<br/>-For some odd reason, the page was being cleaned several times-<br/>-<br/>-We shall all work together to make this page huge.<br/>-<br/>-...and someone (maybe me, maybe someone else) will clean it out.

I would, however, add some caveats:  obviously doing this in the user: space has in the past proven somewhat controversial (though selective linkifying is a 'lighter touch' approach than some have used in the past (such as mass blanking)).  Also, there may be some "legit" instances of fair use images in the template namespace, though these should be the rare exception to the general rule:  ideally there'd be a 'whitelist' maintained somewhere.  Other namespaces I see no reason not to go ahead with immediately.  It appears the majority of these are actually occur on article talk pages, for some unknown reason;  I'll have to double-check that for false positives arising from whackiness in the categorisation of images, of which I have little doubt there will be large amounts.  (Probably images in both the "free" and "fair use" categories, which probably need some sort of separate treatment by way of a "please clarify the status of this image" tag.)  [[User:Alai|Alai]] 19:18, 23 February 2007 (UTC)<br/>+:For false positives I'm checking to make sure a known fair use template in on the page first just like with the OrphanedFairUse bot. A whitelist is a good idea and I was already thinking of putting one in but I think it should be private SoSomebodyWhoKnowsWhatThey'reDoing TM must add the page to the list. [[User:Bjweeks|BJ]]<small><sup>[[User talk:Bjweeks|Talk]]</sup></small> 17:40, 27 February 2007 (UTC)<br/>+::Is there a distinction between "known fair use template", and anything that categorises images in the "fair use images" category?  Is there such a thing as "known 'free image' tags", and likewise, does that differ from the "free images" category?  The overlap between the latter pair seems quite large, but possibly my criteria are blunter than the bot's (though we can take the detail of that off-page).  I'd prefer if the whitelist were ''not'' private as such, on the basis of transparency being the surest and speediest way to fix problems, but I could see a case for protecting it if there's thought to be potential for abuse.  [[User:Alai|Alai]] 05:05, 14 March 2007 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+Depending on how you plan to handle image inclusion that occurs via template expansion, you might want to give some thought into how your bot will interact with [[:Template:Gallery]].  I've seen it in use on many user pages, usually to display thumbs of images that the user has uploaded or that they particularly admire. [[:Template:Gallery]] also occasionally appears elsewhere outside mainspace.  I don't think the bot could safely convert these images into links.   How do you plan on handling these galleries? Do you intend to remove fair use images from galleries, perhaps by commenting them out in the template parameter?  If so, perhaps a note should be added to the corresponding talk page?  —[[User:RP88|RP88]] 14:59, 28 February 2007 (UTC)<br/>+:Mmm those can be dealt with vie a regex replace function as far as I understand. Instead of Find '\[\[(?<image>Image:Blah)\]\]' Replace <nowiki><!-- ${image} --></nowiki>. You should be able to modify that to \[?\[?\s*(?<image>Image:Blah)\]?\]?' Replace <nowiki><!-- ${image} --></nowiki> With some success. I've not looked into this further to see what to do in cases of say... image captions, but that should be a rather trivial modification of the above regex.

The fact that (excepting Main page related things, vandalism, and BJAODN) I've only seen one fair use image placed outside of the user (talk) and article (talk) spaces suggests that there will really hardly be any instances of this.

But for the sake of clarity, for the possible benefit of anyone else proposing to tackle a similar task:  have we determined whether, and in what circumstances, image transclusions should removed without a trace, vs. commented out, vs. linkified?  [[User:Alai|Alai]] 16:31, 18 April 2007 (UTC)<br/>+*I don't think the images should be commented out. I think they should just be removed. The model I imagine is removing the image, leave a message on the talk page of the person in who's userspace the page exists (if it is in userspace). In all cases, leave detailed edit summaries like I do [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Infobox_HRM_Planning_Area&diff=prev&oldid=123920437]. --[[User:Durin|Durin]] 21:50, 18 April 2007 (UTC)<br/>+*:I agree, Generally fair-use images are removed, and commenting them out makes it easier for an unsuspecting editor to put them back in, and it also has to be clear that it isn't vandalism - if possible, though it's probably hard, the person who added it should receive an advisory. [[User:ST47|ST47]]<small>[[User talk:ST47|Talk]]</small> 23:12, 18 April 2007 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+Here's another point for possible posterity:  do we have a clear understanding as to what to do on a per-namespace basis?  From the above, it appears that they should be removed immediately from the user: and user_talk: spaces, and "listified" from the template namespace.  But what about other talk, category, and wikiproject pages?  It'd be very odd if any of those were being transcluded into a FUE page, and really ought to be fixed if they are.  Can those be blanket-removed?  (I'm not sure either way about portalspace.)  Incidentally, the listification could be done without a bot, it's just a matter of synching up with a db dump to ensure it's fairly recent and accurate, so if there's individuals or a cleanup project wanting to work on these...  [[User:Alai|Alai]] 00:24, 19 April 2007 (UTC)<br/>+*I'm not sure that we can make a determination variance per namespace. The display of fair use images is not allowed outside of mainspace and that policy makes no distinction whether it be user, portal, or projectspace. <br/>+*I've done a few thousand of these removals. The vast, vast majority (probably more than 99.7-8% of them never required me to turn them into links. Occasionally, it does happen. Witness [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AApple_Inc.&diff=123809467&oldid=123741129 this diff]. So, can a bot do this work since it requires a Mk 1 Human Eyeball to figure out when to remove and when to link? Yes, a bot can. My reason is this; even if the bot is ''wrong'', and should have linked instead of removed, in the rare instances when this would happen other contributors can come along and fix it without there being much disruption to Wikipedia, the project, which is the encyclopedia...not these other namespaces. --[[User:Durin|Durin]] 12:58, 19 April 2007 (UTC)</td>

Yes, Tabari is one of the most respected of early Islamic historian but when reporting reports, some scholars report everything that is heard even though that particular report might be weak -- now this is assuming Tabari even reported this. This doesn't mean the entire book is weak but just merely a few reports in his history collection that is weak due due to it being falling short of the historic analaysis that it goes through. The science is known as "Jarh wa Tadeel" in arabic   to muslims scientists/scholars. <br/>-<br/>-And finally, due to the fact that it is a weak, if not fabricated report, it makes it contraversial and shouldn't be inserted in an "encyclopedia" due to the fact it doesn't serve any benefit and the information could be wrong. An encyclopedia's job is to give un-biased '''factual''' confirmed knowledge. Not some random sayings. You goto message boards for that. Not to an encyclopedia because that ruins it's reputation. So I request the blabber about Muslims not wanting to see persians become muslim should be removed.<br/>-<br/>-As for the other user claiming racism on part of Arabs under the headline "Reluctance to let dhimmis convert" and saying "as if there is no doubts of such reports" at all and just slamming the sciences of historic analysis all together. My question is, if I make something up right now about the history of french people, how would you know it's authentic. The user does exactly the same about Arabs as if "there is no doubt" and never quotes anything but simply gives obsecure and strange incidents. I ask him to back up his claims with sufficient evidence and not to spread falsehood on this website. Keep it professional please. This is not a message board.<br/>---- Khawaja--<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-I didn't say the book doesn't exist.

That is a pretty big accusation. You are accusing a former Aga Khan Harvard Chair of lying. That's something you better have some damn good support for, other than your personal hunch. I repeat, the actual sentence is in the book, and Frye provides References to it. Furthermore, what you call "weak" (i.e. Frye's reporting) has been described as "the definitive history of Persia" by professional reviewers.<br/>-<br/>-In fact, I would call this "Jarh wa Tahmeel". --[[User:Zereshk|Zereshk]] 1 July 2005 21:54 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-==Desire==<br/>-<br/>-You're really going to have to explain how you know the "desires" of men from 1.300 years ago.

The Frye book is an older source, and perhaps not the best, but there is ample evidence from later scholars, like Crone, Berkey, and Hawting, supporting the contention. The Arabs were settled in garrison towns, like Basra and Kufa, to keep them from contact with the newly conquered peoples. Any dhimmi who wished to convert was required to find an Arab patron, who would adopt him into his tribe as a client. This erased any former standing the client had, and made him into a extremely junior participant in the tribe's hierarchy. It was easier for slaves and wives/concubines to convert, but they were already in a position of subjection. <br/>-<br/>-Why? There is a fair bit of evidence that many of the early Muslims believed that Muhammad was the messenger to the ''Arabs'', who were the best of men. The older faiths were sufficient for salvation, and appropriate for those lesser beings, the dhimmis. The jizya tax paid by dhimmis was one of the main resources of the government, and was threatened by conversions. There are records of whole communities wanting to convert, and being refused. <br/>-<br/>-Zereshk is perhaps wrong in thinking that this was directed against Persians. It was a general policy in every territory outside Arabia. [[User:Zora|Zora]] 30 June 2005 20:42 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-----<br/>-<br/>-#The page is about what was directed against Persians, not anybody else. The page is about The Conquest of Iran, not The Conquest of Africa or Byzantium.<br/>-#Unfortunately Zora seems to think that any old source is automatically up for dismissal. With that type of thinking, we should throw away Einstein's Relativity, Newtonian Physics, etc since they are quite old. This has been a great handicap for Zora in undertsanding Iran and Islam, since most sources used (e.g. The Nahj ul-Balagheh) were written centuries ago. A new study isn't necessarily correct just because it is new.<br/>-#That there was heavy reluctance by the Arabs to accept Persians as equals in their ranks (both religiously and socially) is indisputable fact. There is no contention to that.--[[User:Zereshk|Zereshk]] 1 July 2005 00:29 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-----<br/>-<br/>-Sigh. Zereshk, I agreed with you, in the main, and differed only a point of emphasis. You think that this policy was directed at ''Persians''; I point out that it was directed against non-Arabs. Persians are non-Arabs, so they qualified for oppression. However -- it was not an ''anti-Persian'' policy. To see it as such is to read current antagonisms into the past. It's as if you were to say that the British colonials had special contempt for Persians, when in fact the racists among them would say "It's all wogs past Calais," or just claim that "white" men were better than "brown/red/yellow/black" men. [[User:Zora|Zora]] 1 July 2005 01:28 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-:Yes, I know it was directed at non-Persians. But '''this''' page is not about Non-Perisans.

You are invited to include opposing references in the article if you have additional information. Thanks. [[User:SouthernComfort|SouthernComfort]] 1 July 2005 22:53 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-----<br/>-<br/>-How am I suppose to give opposing references to false reports and reference them? For example, If I make up a random report that someone got killed in my city by the name of John. Can you find a opposing report or article that in Toronto, John DIDN'T get killed. No, because articles aren't written on what DIDN'T happen. Similarly, how am I suppose to source and reference on a report that is weak (if not false). Just doesn't make sense. May be I should fabricate that man went to Mars yesterday and you are obliged to give me a referenced report that man didn't. After establishing the report in Tabari is weak (if not false), we shouldn't include it since it paints an inaccurate if not false account of history. Only authentic evidence should be used to explain history. Especially in a encyclopedia for God's sake! - Khawaja<br/>-<br/>-: Hullo, Khawaja, you can sign your messages by putting four tildes after them (a tilde is a ~). <br/>-<br/>-: The article as it stands is biased towards Iranians rather than Arabs, who are depicted as racists and oppressors (though I must admit that in the early years of the caliphate, there's a good case for this). A number of the Iranian contributors here seem to me to be cherishing hatreds stoked during the Iran-Iraq war. The article needs to be NPOVd. <br/>-<br/>-: It's also true that Zereshk and Southern Comfort don't have the historian's view of sources, as both necessary and to be regarded with suspicion. I have clashed with them repeatedly in other articles over their use of sources and their methods of historical argument.<br/>-<br/>-: Perhaps then it will make a stronger impression if I say that every academic source I've read makes the point that dhimmis were not encouraged to convert during the first few centuries of Islamic rule.  <br/>-<br/>-:: The non-Arabs were rarely asked or forced to convert; on the whole they were dissuaded. They simply had to pay for the upkeep of those who had defeated them, preferably in a manner which emphasized their twin humiliation of non-Arab ethnicity and unbelief.  -- Crone, ''Slaves on Horses'', 1980, p. 54.<br/>-<br/>-:: By the end of the period, in spite of the initial attempt by the Arabs to keep themselves apart religiously and socially from their subjects, and in spite of the refusal of caliphs and governors to allow the non-Arabs to enjoy the advantages of acceptance of Islam, large numbers of the subject peoples had come to identify themselves as Muslims. -- Hawting, ''The First Dynasty of Islam'', 2000, p. 8.<br/>-<br/>-:: As is well-known, the Arabs made no attempt to impose their faith on their new subjects, and at first in fact discouraged conversions on the part of non-Arabs. -- Berkey, ''The Formation of Islam'', 2003, p. 74. <br/>-<br/>-These are all respected academics, and books published by university presses. All the authors are speaking on the basis of wide reading in Arab chroniclers, not just Tabari. This is probably not part of the history that is taught or emphasized in many Muslim-majority countries, but it seems well-attested to me. [[User:Zora|Zora]] 3 July 2005 00:17 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-::Zora, I suggest that you stop making personal attacks and accusations of bias. [[User:SouthernComfort|SouthernComfort]] 3 July 2005 02:35 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-Ok look, all these things you are quoting to show Arabs are racist are written by people in our times and they don't have any evidence for the "history". How can they know if those things happened or Arabs acted that way back then? Are they 1400 years old to witness this? The only way to know the reality or to know history is by learning it from historians back then who were recording history. This is how history works. In 3000 years from now, no one can make up the history of Japan out of nowhere. They need evidence from people now who are writing it now and perserving it. Obviously, this article is biased, racist, and is purely Iranian propaganda. You can tell by the way Zora talks and see he is just taking things off his chest and has no historic evidence. I ask for those illict comments to be removed to keep this article neutral. --[[User:Khawaja|Khawaja]] 2005-07-03 02:23:51 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-:: For one thing, Zora is a she. <br/>-<br/>-:: Khawaja, you can't just refuse to believe something because it's unpleasant and shocking. I can't give you the cites from Arabic sources because I can't read Arabic -- but all those scholars CAN. They are making those assertions based on extensive reading in sources in many languages -- not just secondary sources in English, French, German, etc., but also primary sources in Arabic. I just counted -- in the 16 page bibliography at the end of Crone's book, there are 58 different Arab authors cited. This is not just relying on Tabari. [[User:Zora|Zora]] 3 July 2005 07:34 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-:Khawaja, again, the information in this article is sourced. If you have a problem with that, please provide references from opposing scholars.

Just like that, blam, because you can. The template is just a sign that there is no consensus, and it is supposed to stay up until the editors reach one. You are making no effort at consensus. Obviously, I don't agree completely with Khawaja, but I do agree with her that the article is biased. Please, let's work towards developing an article that will be less controversial. [[User:Zora|Zora]] 3 July 2005 07:38 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-::Zora, an NPOV tag is only warranted if the information in the article is based on opinion or is too speculative. In this case, the information in this article is fully sourced. You know this, and Khawaja refuses to accept the sources. If Khawaja has a problem with the sources, let the editor provide opposing references as I have suggested. Then we can discuss NPOV. What do you say? [[User:SouthernComfort|SouthernComfort]] 3 July 2005 09:58 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-::: SC, you seem to see only factoids, and be blind to the overall impression made by the choice of words, the choice of facts to present, the flow of the argument, etc. The overall impression is anger at Arabs. That can be fixed. It's not just a question of sources, though I hope that Khawaja will look at some of the sources cited. She doesn't have to come up with any "facts" or "sources" to prove that the article is POV ... an article can be POV just from the words used. [[User:Zora|Zora]] 3 July 2005 10:23 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-As we have seen, this discussion and racism is based against Arabs upon Zora’s passions only. Accusing me of not believing simply because it’s shocking??? Where as I am not believing because of the single weak report in Tabari and that that makes it unsuitable to be in an unbiased encyclopedia. Go put it in your Iranian encyclopedia. You claim that the issue is so widely known out of nowhere and how there is 16 pages worth of evidence from Arabic historic text? Can you please quote something from the scholars instead of lying upon them? Show me the 16 pages! If such an issue DOES exist, then I don't mind whatsoever for anything to be written about it. Let’s write an entire section on this if it is accurate history. But unfortunately no, the report is just one in Tabari and weak. Fyre only quotes Tabari and that one report. If there were more, he would've quoted more since that’s what he is trying to criticize the Arabs for. Don't put words in people’s mouth and fabricate things. And grow up and don’t remove my tags! --[[User:Khawaja|Khawaja]] 2005-07-03 07:54:00 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-: Khawaja, you're not reading carefully. I said it was a 16 page bibliography. In tiny print. And many languages. I'm not going to type it up and post it for you. The books that I cited should be in your university library, where you can consult them. <br/>-<br/>-: I should add another book -- one that I just dug out of the pile -- ''Arabs and Others in Early Islam'', by Suliman Bashear, Darwin Press, 1997. It is very dense and hard reading, because it is almost exclusively quotes from early Arab sources (the author was a Palestinian and had clearly had an extensive Islamic education). You might also like it because the author is saying that from the very beginning of Islam there were two strains of thought re Islam and non-Arabs, one accepting and one rejecting non-Arabs. Bashear gives cites for both. Plus many cites re Arabs and Persians. [[User:Zora|Zora]] 3 July 2005 08:25 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-::The U of T has one of the most extensive libraries in N.

Khawaja should have no problem verifying this data if s/he has any doubts as to the veracity of this article.

I wouldnt keep all of it though, since its tone sounds a bit inflammatory in intention. For example, Umar also burned the Alexandria library, saying the same thing: "if it is with the Quran, we dont need it; if it is against the Quran, we must destroy it"). It wasnt just Persian libraries. Persia was overrun and massacred by Umar's armies (meaning that those events would probably not have happened, were it somebody else instead of Umar). But Surena's additions puts the blame on ''all'' "Arabs". Ali was in fact sympathetic to the Persians, and was not happy with the state of affairs of the conquest.

So the wealth of a place was definitly not the reason behind the conquest. Therefore, this claim is false.<br/>-<br/>-::In fact it was. Frye discusses this in detail (that the conquest was mainly driven by the desire to collect booty). Omar in fact prohibited the conversion of Persians to Islam in the first years of conquest. But after the fall of Madain' and the collected spoils, things changed. (See? Why do I have to keep going thru repeated discussions again and again? That's why we provide references. When the references are taken out, the same stupid questions are asked all over again.). Think about it, if that was NOT the case, then why conquer Persia when you dont want Persians becoming muslims anyway? The Persians were never welcomed as equals even when they converted.

'''Had it been Ali's decision, none of the events of the conquest would have happened the way they did.

There would be no "second class citizens", no "racism against Persians", no "mawali" and no consequent "shu'ubiyah", if it were under Ali.

Because Persia has done similar things in its history too. When [[Nadir Shah]] invaded India, it was only done to amass and plunder wealth. A very despicable act.<br/>-#My personal position aside, I must admit that there is a lot of bias and hatred against Arabs, ethnically, nowadays. And that is a result of the Jahiliyah tactics initiated by Umar. No surprise. However, the hatred is also both ways. Iranians still remember how many Arabs supported Saddam in the Iran-Iraq war. Iranians remember that 600 Hajj pilghrims were massacred by Saudi Arabian Police in 87, just for shouting slogans against America. And once you see how Iranians are treated and humiliated by Arabs in airports in Saudi Arabia, you get [http://www.iranian.com/Kasraie/2005/February/Islam/index.html the idea]. Trust me, when youre a minority in a given population (a non-Arab among Arab muslims), it is very easy to see [http://www.muslimwakeup.com/main/archives/2005/02/i_am_a_nigger_a.php certain things].<br/>-<br/>-So I am therefore against anyone who says there is bias here against Arabs.

I restored the earlier text, and tried to rewrite your text to NPOV it. I agree that your POV should be presented, but it should not be presented as the one-and-only truth. <br/>-<br/>-Reference to purdah rather than chador restored. Perhaps this needs to be discussed further -- I haven't checked the purdah article. However, I believe that it's commonly accepted that the upper-class Persian, pre-Islamic institution of the anderun, the women's quarters, was taken into an Arabic culture that hadn't previously kept women indoors (as would indeed have been impossible for nomads). I'm not at all sure that the chador was Persian in origin -- however, this would take some investigation. I'm not sure that anyone has written a HISTORY of hijab, which would be an interesting topic. [[User:Zora|Zora]] 22:22, 26 November 2005 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-----<br/>-<br/>-Zora, due to your insufficient knowledge and '''bias''', you have, again,  deliberately deleted most of what i took from academic works from Iran by Iranian academics whom have quoted and acknowledged Frye and other well known Islamic historians. Also you selectively deleted historic narrations from Al Tabari and Ibn Khuldun in order to write some form of improvised (and yet lame) "Anti-Islamist-from-Iran-residing-in-US" POV. Works like that of Reza Aslan and other western writers writing about  Islamic history are not to be taken for granted and have, in many cases, lied about Islam and its history, both intentionally or unknowingly and are not going to make pigs fly. Ive reverted the initial article since there is nothing wrong with it. It was NPOV'd and looks just fine. And no, we dont need any "Investigation" dear, its widely known the Chador is Iranian, it means Tent and that is was adapted by the rest of the Islamic world from Iran.--[[User:Paradoxic|Paradoxic]] 14:47, 27 November 2005 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-:: Paradoxic, you took a small section and turned it into a bloated anti-Arab rant. Wikipedia is not the place to refight the Iran-Iraq war, or to indulge anti-Arab passions. You can't just declare that your version is NPOV and argue that anyone who protests is just "biased".  <br/>-<br/>-:: As for veiling and seclusion -- I'm not sure that you can just declare that "everyone knows" they're Persian in origin and leave it at that. The incident in Medina when Muhammad's wives were put behind the veil certainly occurred before the Islamic conquest of Persia. There's evidence that this originally applied ONLY to Muhammad's wives, and that it gradually diffused outward as a custom. But was it only Persians who practiced that custom, at the time? I'm not sure that it was so. I seem to recall, vaguely, some references to it being practiced throughout the Middle East, not just in the Persian domains. It also misrepresents the phenomenon to just describe it as veiling, when the rules for the use of the veil assume a division of the world into "women's quarters", anderun, where the veil was not required, and the public sphere, where women were to be veiled. (BTW, this phenomenon has occurred in other parts of the world -- the upper-class women of Heian Japan were secluded -- but not by veils, but by reed blinds. When they had to leave their quarters, they travelled in closed litters.) [[User:Zora|Zora]] 19:55, 27 November 2005 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-----<br/>-<br/>-Paradoxic, I made an attempt to include your POV in my version; you have restored your anti-Arab rant. I suspect that you were raised and taught in such a wartime, nationalist atmosphere that you cannot see just how offensive your edits would be to an Arab reader. I'm not an Arab and I'm certainly not an Arab nationalist, but I do care about being fair. <br/>-<br/>-If you don't like my version of your position, then rewrite it IN CONCISE FORM. Wikipedia is not a forum for long, meandering personal essays. People come to articles for information, not opinions. All sides of a dispute should get roughly equal space in an article. You don't give one position a short para and another a long essay. <br/>-<br/>-Would you be OK with simply deleting the section? Perhaps it's a mistake to have it there. [[User:Zora|Zora]] 21:13, 27 November 2005 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-::: No, i am not Anti arab at all, quite on the contrary ..nor did i write anything anti arabic on my article, you seem to mistake me for yourself. The initial article stated "The Persians strongly resisted cultural and linguistic Arabization." This by itself is an indirect long lasting anti-arab myth. You defended this very initial article. Another example of your bias-anti Arab position can be found in another piece of text you've included,  ''Nationalist narratives also tend to stress the initial poverty of Arab culture and the great role of Persians in creating what Arabs now cherish as their intellectual heritage. Arabs are cast as uncultured barbarians, appropriating the achievements of more advanced races.''.   I dont see where you get these "Rabbit out of the Hat" magical quotations, wich are mostly Cliche's found in comicbooks, but they are absolute garbage nor deserve not to be mentioned on an encyclopedia. It has nothing to do with POV or NPOV, its complete ignorance. As far as the Chador thing goes, as im aware of, Chador was worn before and after the Islamic conquest in Iran and because it complied with Modest Islamic dresscode principles it was accepted and people continued to wear it, this is not exclusive to Iran. Also you seem to not be able to realize that there are many types of Veils and the Chador being one of them. I dont see where you go around speaking about the Prophet Mohammad (s) and claiming its exclusively a "Cultural" thing and that only his wives had to wear it, no, this is jibberish and not supported by any islamic school of thought, be it Sunnite or Shia. The hejab is ''fard'' for obvious reasons, we dont need to go back into history to rehash its relevance.  Refrain from omitting my quoted texts wich are all from academic works, if you wish to have refrence to them ill be glad to find them for you but do not engage in terrorizing this article with your biased ignorance. The article as stands is neither Anti arab nor anti Persian as it initially '''was'''. It's NPOV and Looks just fine unless other contributors argue the same. I am however, not at all willing to omit these obvious factual occurances based on your mere dislike of what i have quoted.--[[User:Paradoxic|Paradoxic]] 21:24, 27 November 2005 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-::actually, scholars who have studied the issue of ''hijāb'' (and you can read about this in any of the literature about women in islam -- see books by leila ahmed, amina wadud, ziba mir-hosseini, even karen armstrong, ''etc''. -- and even the new book by ''iranian'' scholar Nimat Hafez Barazangi) believe that initially the concept of ''hijāb'' was restricted only to the prophet's wives (this is supported by ''hadīth'' studies of ''asbāb an-nazūl'' / circumstances of revelation, for it was revealled after his marriage to a wife and many men stayed late in his house). in fact, the arabic word hijab means curtain or separation -- the meaning of 'veil' developed later. scholars believed that muslims adopted the cultural practice common in the sāsānian empire (as well as byzantium) whereby upper-class women covered themselves. but even this adoption was gradual and depended on cultural circumstances. in fact, if you look at muslim women around the world, you will notice varying practices and observances that demonstrate it's a matter of local culture. that doesnt mean that it isnt justified by the verse about hijab, but what it does mean is that veiling is ''not'' something called for in the qur'ān or by muhammad, but a later innovation. cheers, dgl<br/>-<br/>-== "Obvious fact" ==<br/>-<br/>-Paradoxic, you HAVE to allow other points of view (POVs) to be expressed. You can't just declare that your POV is the truth and that no others will be allowed. We clearly have two POVs here. One is mine, which I think is a kinda bland academic view, and one is yours, which I think must express the sentiments of many Iranians who came of age in the fervidly nationalist atmosphere of the Revolution and the Iran-Iraq war. What all your teachers told you is FACT is not considered FACT outside Iran. The nationalism that seems to so right to you, and the interpretation of all of history as just a prelude to the glorious Iran of today, just seems jingoist and bathetic to someone who doesn't share those sentiments. The bedrock of Wikipedia is the NPOV policy and that means that you must allow other viewpoints to be expressed. Furthermore, they have to be expressed in terms that the holders of those views would agree are accurate. You can't just give YOUR version of the POV and say, "There, you're represented."

Not at all, it's your view against my reciting of academic works. Your POV (Wether you regard it scholarly or not, lol) is meaningless in regard to the high caliber historians and scholars who wrote extensive material about this subject and are widely accepted. I merely cited these. I was not raised as a nationalist; If trying to get personal is your way of trying to say your right, then i am sorry, but these are not my views, i cited them from academic works stemming from Iran and the middle east, by Iranians and Arabs about the Influences of Iranians towards Arab culture and vice versa in a friendly and non insultive objective manner. I have included viewpoints that were of relevance and truth and did '''not''' delete everything as you claim, however as much of what you, or someone else wrote previously was mainly based on myth and not fact, i cant let that pass. Im sorry, It was garbage. Again, I will repeat this for the last time, since you seem to have a comprehension issue; Specific works by widely accepted scholars and historians have been written about this topic, and it is very relevant that it be mentioned. You are vandalizing this page by deleting such works that are essential to the Islamic conquest of Iran. I realize you are a hindu so you might have a dislike or even a strong hatred for Islam, Arabs and Persians, but you should rather try [[Yoga]], [[Tae_Bo|Tae Bo]], or something else thats way more progressive than to ignorantly insult people with uttering nonsense and deceit. I know this is hard to believe, but smell the cofee; you are not above anyone here, nor do you have the authority to decide what permenently goes on the page, the poorly researched material you are desperately clinging on to is meaningless to the mainstream widely accepted scholars ive cited and contrary to what you have cited previously.--[[User:Paradoxic|Paradoxic]] 23:51, 10 December 2005 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-:: You are not being civil, Paradoxic.

You telling people they engage in "Chest beating behaviour" can hardly be someone to take seriously. The topics mentioned such as the Chador, the usage of Persian words into the Arabic Language (wich can be elaborated on), Persian carpets being widely used have both a pre-islamic root as well as the aftermath. Besides if the aftermath is irrelevant then i dont see why the "Parsees" are mentioned going to India either. The big picture must be shown, i have quoted both Arab and Iranian scholars without adding my own oppinion, as ive told you. You '''''cannot''''' delete such academic works crucial to the page.

Everything AFTER the last three points is debateable -- and has been debated. The whole issue of Arabicization is a hot one in Islamic studies. <br/>-<br/>-: Phrasing like "higher cultural background" is needlessly inflammatory, ethnocentric, and just plain boasting. I understand what is being said -- there is a difference between an empire with a written literature and a long history, and a recent tribal coalition with an oral literature -- but there are ways to say it that aren't as judgmental. <br/>-<br/>-: Moreover, we don't need to go back to the Umayyads to account for current anti-Arab prejudice. The long history of warfare between the Ottomans and the Safavids certainly has something to do with it (massacres of Shi'a in Ottoman territories), as well as the vexed history of Khuzestan, the problem of ethnic minorities in Iran, and the wounds of the Iran-Iraq war. <br/>-<br/>-::And vice versa, about Arab massacres and racism elsewhere.

Saddam used it as a symbol of Arab superiority to Persians. Are some of you reacting to that? We could add a section that discusses Persian (as opposed to Iranian) attitudes towards the conquest, over history. If it gets long, it could become a breakout article (as I suggested to dgl for the battle). Start with Firdausi and work up to contemporary attitudes? It's a matter of stepping back from the material and instead of saying, "This is the truth", saying "This is what many Persians believe, or believed". It's the claims to truth that are problematic.

The transmission is a "manumatic", meaning it offers the driver a choice of driving the car as either an automatic or a clutchless manual.<br/>+<br/>+The B5 A4 is arguably a watershed model for Audi. Previously regarded as somewhat of a bit-player in the luxury car segment, the massive improvement in quality and engineering with the B5 A4 made buyers realise that there was now a marque other than BMW and Mercedes. Combined with the radical TT concept (later a production car), Audi emerged as a leader in the luxury car market.<br/>+<br/>+=== B5 facelift (1998-2001) ===<br/>+Audi refreshed the model in the 1997 [[Frankfurt Motor Show]], with sales beginning in Europe in early 1998. Besides the introduction of a 2.4&nbsp;L 30-valve V6 (replacing the outdated 2.6 V6), the most important additions to the range were the 2.5&nbsp;L V6 TDI engine with 150&nbsp;PS (110&nbsp;kW) and standard quattro and a 6-speed gearbox, as well the new high-performance [[Audi S4|S4]], now part of the A4 lineup (the previous S4 had been a [[Audi 100]]). New taillights, [[headlights]], door handles, and other minor exterior/interior changes rounded out the cosmetic updates.<br/>+<br/>+In mid 1998, the 1.8T engine available outside Europe had its power output raised to 170&nbsp;PS (125&nbsp;kW), while the 12-valve V6 was replaced by the 30 valve unit that had been available in Europe for two years.<br/>+<br/>+In 1999, Audi debuted an even higher performance model, the [[Audi RS4|RS4]], like its predecessor [[Audi RS2|RS2]] available only in the Avant body.<br/>+<br/>+==B6 (2000-2005)==<br/>+An all-new A4 debuted in late 2000, now riding on the [[Volkswagen B platform#B6|B6]] platform. The 1.6&nbsp;L base model remained unchanged, but most other gasoline engines received either displacement increases or power upgrades. The 1.8&nbsp; 20 valve Turbo was now available in two additional versions, with 150 or 180&nbsp;PS (110 or 132&nbsp;kW), this one with a standard six-speed gearbox, while the naturally aspirated 1.8&nbsp;L straight-4 and 2.8&nbsp;L V6 were replaced by 2.0&nbsp;L and 3.0&nbsp;L units, still with five valves per cylinder, the most powerful of which was capable of 220&nbsp;PS (162&nbsp;kW) and 300&nbsp;Nm (221&nbsp;ft.lbf) of torque. The 1.9 TDI engine was upgraded to 130&nbsp;PS and was now available with quattro, while the 2.5 V6 TDI high-end model was introduced with 180&nbsp;PS (132&nbsp;kW) and standard quattro. The Avant arrived in mid 2001.<br/>+<br/>+For 2002, Audi upgraded power in the 1.8 Turbo engines to 163 and 190&nbsp;PS (120 and 140&nbsp;kW respectively), and in the 2.5 TDI intermediate version to 163&nbsp;PS. A year later, Audi reintroduced the S4, now powered by a 344&nbsp;PS (253&nbsp;kW) 4.2&nbsp;L V8, as well as an A4 Cabrio convertible variant, finally replacing the 80-based Audi Cabriolet that had been discontinued in 1998.<br/>+<br/>+Audi also introduced a [[continuously variable transmission]] developed by [[LuK]], named [[Multitronic]], which replaced the Tiptronic on front wheel drive models. The transmission won considerable praise from the automotive press and is generally regarded as being the best of its type in the world, due to its light weight and promptness in response, but its use was limited to models with a maximum of 310&nbsp;Nm (229&nbsp;ft.lbf).<br/>+<br/>+Borrowing from the [[Audi A6]], the boot was redesigned to remove the extension of the top edge with a smoother fold line, and the taillight assembly now forms part of the top line.<br/>+<br/>+A new cabriolet version of the A4 was introduced in 2002 to replace the ageing Audi 80-based model. It incorporated some minor styling changes which eventually found their way to the sedan version (such as body-colored lower bumper and sill panels).<br/>+<br/>+==B7 (2004-present)==<br/>+Audi introduced a redesigned A4 in late 2004, now riding on the B7 platform, which is completely unique to Audi and not shared with Volkswagen. Nonetheless, the B7 is really a revision of the outgoing B6, and not a ground-up redesign. This is confirmed by Audi's internal platform nomenclature, which uses PL46 (longitudinal passenger car platform, size 4, generation 6) for both B6 and B7 chassis.<br/>+<br/>+The engine lineup received many additions, the most notable of which was the introduction of [[Fuel Stratified Injection]] on the new 2.0 TFSI and 3.2 V6 FSI, respectively capable of 200 and 255&nbsp;PS (147 and 188&nbsp;kW), although these engines dropped the five-valve design in favor of the more widely known four valves per cylinder configuration, as the design was incompatible with the direct injection system. The new 2.0 TDI engine now combined Pumpe Düse (PD) technology with 16 valves for the first time, while the larger 2.5 TDI was increased to 3.0&nbsp;L, with 204&nbsp;PS (150&nbsp;kW). quattro was available either as an option or standard on most mid- to high-end models, with multitronic and Tiptronic automatic gearboxes available throughout the entire lineup. As per the B6, multitronic is available only on front-wheel drive models and Tiptronic only available on quattro models.<br/>+<br/>+In addition to the carry-over S4, which remained unchanged on the technical side, Audi has reintroduced the RS4 to the lineup, for the first time on the [[sedan (car)|sedan]] body and with a normally aspirated 4.2 V8 FSI engine. Another notable inclusion is the 3rd-generation quattro system which uses 40:60 front-rear power distribution. A limited edition variant first introduced in late 2005, named "[[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters|DTM Edition]]", was reintroduced in 2006 as a regular option, the 2.0T FSI engine now engineered to 220&nbsp;PS (162&nbsp;kW) with standard quattro. The front grill assembly has changed to be full height in the same manner as the [[Audi A6]].<br/>+<br/>+The B7 Cabriolet model arrived later than the other two body variants, with sales beginning in February 2006. Brand new on the Cabriolet was an entry-level 2.0 TDI version with standard quattro. In April, the B7 received the 170&nbsp;PS (125&nbsp;kW) 2.0 TDI engine that premiered in the VW Golf GTD and Audi A3.<br/>+<br/>+=== Current lineup ===<br/>+{| <br/>+|-<br/>+! A4<br/>+! Power<br/>+!

Early reports suggested that the B8 A4 would adopt rear-wheel drive to help Audi compete against the BMW 3-series and its rear-wheel drive platform; it is said that Volkswagen Group chairman Bernd Pischestreider vetoed this move, fearing it would alienate Audi's existing customer base.<br/>+<br/>+It is believed that Audi plans to make the B8 platform common to both the new A4 and the future A6. Various media reports suggest that the B8 A4 will incorporate the following features -<br/>+<br/>+- 3rd-generation quattro system, providing 40:60 front:rear torque split<br/>+- improved weight distribution thanks to moving the engine and gearbox rearward<br/>+- a slight reduction in overall length, possibly due to shorter front and rear overhangs<br/>+<br/>+The B8 A4 is expected to be available in late 2007 or early 2008.<br/>+<br/>+Rumors of an A4-based coupe have been backed up with various spy shots and computer-generated images, many of which were digital composites of the cabriolet and sedan models.

With an area of approximately 25,000 km<sup>2</sup> (2.5 million hectares or 6,191,000 acres), it is the largest [[national park]] in [[South-East Asia]]. In [[1999]] Lorentz was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]].<br/>+'''Albia''' is a city in [[Monroe County, Iowa|Monroe County]], [[Iowa]], [[United States]]. The population was 3,706 at the 2000 census. It is the [[county seat]] of [[Monroe County, Iowa|Monroe County]]{{GR|6}}.<br/> <br/>-An outstanding example of the [[biodiversity]] of [[New Guinea]], Lorentz is one of the most ecologically diverse national parks in the world. It is the only nature reserve in the Asia-Pacific region to contain a full altitudial array of [[ecosystem]]s spanning from [[marine]] areas, [[mangrove]], [[tidal forest|tidal]] and [[freshwater swamp]] forest, [[rainforest|lowland]] and [[rainforest|montane]] rainforest, [[alpine ecosystem|alpine]] areas, and equatorial [[glaciers]]. At 4884 meters, [[Mount Jaya]] (formerly Mt. [[Carstenz]]) is the tallest mountain between the Himalayas and the Andes.<br/>+==Geography==<br/>+[[Image:IAMap-doton-Albia.PNG|right|Location of Albia, Iowa]]<br/>+Albia is located at {{coor dms|41|1|36|N|92|48|19|W|city}} (41.026600, -92.805262){{GR|1}}.<br/> <br/>-Birdlife International has called Lorentz Park “probably the single most important reserve in New Guinea” [http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/ebas/index.html?action=EbaHTMDetails.asp&sid=188&m=0 (Birdlife International, 1999)]. <br/>+According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 8.1 [[km²]] (3.1 [[square mile|mi²]]), all land.<br/> <br/>-Lorentz Park contains many unmapped and unexplored areas, and is certain to contain many species of plants and animals as yet unknown to Western science. Local communities' [[ethnobotany|ethnobotanical]] and [[ethnozoology|ethnozoological]] knowledge of the Lorentz biota is also very poorly documented.<br/>+==Demographics==<br/>+As of the [[census]]{{GR|2}} of 2000, there were 3,706 people, 1,531 households, and 943 families residing in the city. The [[population density]] was 457.2/km² (1,184.8/mi²). There were 1,708 housing units at an average density of 210.7/km² (546.0/mi²). The racial makeup of the city was 97.92% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 0.32% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.32% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 0.62% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.24% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 0.57% from two or more races. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 0.84% of the population.<br/> <br/>-==Cultural Aspects==<br/>+There were 1,531 households out of which 29.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 46.8% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 11.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 38.4% were non-families. 33.9% of all households were made up of individuals and 19.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.31 and the average family size was 2.97.<br/> <br/>-The forests of Lorentz encompass the traditional lands of several ethnic groups, including the [[Asmat people|Asmat]], [[Amungme]], [[Dani people|Dani]], [[Sempan]], and [[Nduga]]. It is widely acknowledged that conservation management strategies for the park will have to incorporate the needs and aspirations of these peoples if the park is to succeed in protecting [[biodiversity]].  Moreover, cultural diversity is another important measure of success for the park as well.<br/>+In the city the population was spread out with 25.1% under the age of 18, 7.9% from 18 to 24, 24.2% from 25 to 44, 19.8% from 45 to 64, and 22.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 39 years. For every 100 females there were 85.5 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 80.5 males.<br/> <br/>-==Threats==<br/>-<br/>-The main threats to the biodiversity of Lorentz are from commercial [[logging]], forest conversion for plantation [[agriculture]], smallholder agricultural conversion, [[mining]]/[[oil]]/[[gas]] development, and the [[poaching|illegal species trade]]. [[Climate change]] also poses a substantial threat. <br/>-<br/>-As of 2005, there was no reported commercial logging or other large-scale threats present inside the park. There are no currently active forest conversion projects, and agricultural conversion is minimal. The illegal species trade is known to be a serious problem. A large gold/copper mining operation has been active for decades to the west and north of the park but is not active inside the park boundaries. Oil exploration inside and to the northeast of the park is ongoing.  <br/>-<br/>-The overall health of the biodiversity of Lorentz Park is currently excellent. While logging and other threats have yet to materialize, it is likely that this will become a threat in the future. Climate change poses a very real threat, but its specific implications for Lorentz are uncertain.<br/>-<br/>-==Conservation Status==<br/>-<br/>-As of 2005, there were no park staff or guards assigned to Lorentz. However, the park's success largely depends on local communities' understanding of and support for conservation, rather than external enforcement alone. Several conservation organizations are working in the Lorentz area. <br/>-<br/>-==References==<br/>-<br/>-*[http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/ebas/index.html?action=EbaHTMDetails.asp&sid=188&m=0 Birdlife EBA Factsheet: South Papuan Lowlands]<br/>-*Petocz, Ronald G.

James''' (born [[May 20]], [[1969]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]], best known for his appearances with the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) as '''"The Road Dogg" Jesse James'''; a former member of [[D-Generation X]], and the [[tag team]] partner of [[Monty Sopp|Billy Gunn]], with whom he comprised the [[New Age Outlaws]] and [[New Age Outlaws|The James Gang]] (now known as the Voodoo Kin Mafia). He is currently working for [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA).<br/>+His church services and evangelistic sermons are broadcast on ''The Potter's Touch'', which airs on the [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]].  He also airs on [[The Word Network]]. Other aspects of Jakes' ministry include an annual [[revivalism|revival]] called "MegaFest" (which draws more than 100,000 people during that period of time), an annual women's conference called "Woman Thou Art Loosed", and [[gospel music]] recordings.<br/> <br/>-== Career ==<br/>-Brian Gerard James is the youngest son of wrestling patriarch [[Bob Armstrong]] and has three elder brothers ([[Brad Armstrong|Brad]], [[Scott Armstrong|Scott]] and [[Steve Armstrong|Steve]]) who are also wrestlers. James served in the [[United States Marine Corps]] from 1987 to 1993 and fought in [[Desert Storm|Operation Desert Storm]] in 1991 where he was a [[platoon]] [[sergeant]] in command of 33 Marines. During his [[recruit training]] at [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island]] in [[Parris Island, South Carolina]], James was named Honor Man. Six months after receiving his discharge in 1993, James began wrestling. <br/>+Bishop T. D. Jakes has become one of America's best-known [[pentecostal]] ministers. He has met many famous evangelicals, and many of them look to Bishop Jakes as a sort of [[Billy Graham]]. <br/>+He founded The Potter's House in [[1996]], with about 50 families that had relocated with him from his former congregation, Greater Emmanuel Temple of Faith in [[Cross Lanes, West Virginia]].  By [[December 2002]], it had 28,000 members. <!-- This has been said by some to be one of the fastest growing megachurches in America. (commented out: by whom? on what evidence?) --> Both Jakes and his Potter's House church are unrelated to the [[Potter's House Christian Fellowship]], a Pentecostal denomination founded in Arizona in [[1970]].<br/> <br/>-=== World Wrestling Federation ===<br/>-After wrestling for a whole year in [[Smoky Mountain Wrestling]] and making occasional appearance for [[World Championship Wrestling]] as '''Brian Armstrong''', James began his career with the then [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] towards the end of 1994. He was billed as '''The [[Road crew|Roadie]]''', an assistant to "Double J" [[Jeff Jarrett]], a would-be country singer. He wrestled on several [[pay-per-view|PPVs]] and television shows but most of his first WWF tenure was spent accompanying Jarrett and interfering in his matches. In early 1995, Jeff Jarrett would release the song "With My Baby Tonight" that Jarrett claimed he had sung himself. The planned angle was that it would be revealed that it was the Roadie, not Jarrett, who had really performed the vocals on this song sparking a feud between the two wrestlers. However, before this revelation could take place, Jarrett and James suddenly left the WWF following the second [[In Your House]] pay-per-view on [[July 23]], [[1995]]. James then joined the [[United States Wrestling Association]] as '''Jesse James Armstrong''', winning the heavyweight and tag titles before being forced to leave as a result of a defeat at the hands of Jeff Jarrett.<br/>+The movie ''[[Woman Thou Art Loosed]]'' is based on Jakes' novel of the same name.<br/> <br/>-James returned to the WWF in 1996 as '''Jesse James''', "The Real Double J", and revealed himself, somewhat belatedly, to be the true singer of "With My Baby Tonight". He languished as a midcard singles wrestler until he formed a [[tag team]] with [[Monty Sopp|Billy Gunn]]. A [[World Wrestling Entertainment#WWF Attitude|change in creative direction]] in the WWF in late 1997 led Billy Gunn who had formerly been stuck in the unpopular gimmick of "Rockabilly," to bleach his hair blonde and assume the name "Badd Ass" Billy Gunn (also known as Mr. Ass), while James became '''"The Road Dogg" Jesse James'''. The appearance and mannerisms of the team became more and more controversial and anti-social. The team, known as the New Age Outlaws, feuded with the [[Road Warriors]] and the short-lived tag team of [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]] and [[Terry Funk|Chainsaw Charlie]] before joining [[D-Generation X]] the night after ''[[WrestleMania XIV]]''.<br/>+For the 2006 [[PBS]] program ''[[African American Lives]]'', Jakes had his [[DNA]] analyzed; his [[Y chromosome]] showed that he is descended from the [[Igbo people]] of what is now [[Nigeria]]. According to family tradition, he is also descended from the [[Igbo people]] through his paternal grandmother.<br/> <br/>-James's career peaked in late 1998 and 1999 with the [[New Age Outlaws]] as D-Generation X became more and more popular. The team split briefly in mid-1999 but soon reconciled. The Outlaws amassed five [[WWE World Tag-Team Championship|Tag Title]] titles before Gunn was (legitimately) injured in early 2000 and unceremoniously thrown out of D-Generation X to explain his absence.  James then teamed with fellow D-Generation X member [[Sean Waltman|X-Pac]] throughout the summer of 2000 but failed to regain his former popularity or title success. The team eventually split and D-Generation X fell apart.  James then formed a tag team with newcomer [[Ron Killings|K-Kwik]] but was released from the WWF soon after. It was rumored that his release was due to arriving at an arena under the influence of drugs. In November 2000, James forgot the name of the town he was visiting and showed up at a [[Cleveland]] wrestling taping proclaiming '[[Detroit]] rock city.....' , which got him booed so much it had to be edited out of the broadcast.<br/>+He lives in a $1.7 million mansion in one of the most exclusive parts of the [[Dallas]]/Fort Worth area with his wife Serita and their five children. <br/> <br/>-Over the next two years, James's career lost momentum.  His most prominent appearance was with the short lived [[World Wrestling All-Stars]] (WWA) promotion.<br/> <br/>-===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling===<br/>-Brian James debuted for the upstart Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) promotion on [[September 18]], [[2002]] wrestling as '''B.G. James''' (the popular Road Dogg [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] being owned by the WWE). He was initially a [[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] and one of the founding members of [[Vince Russo|Vince Russo's]] Sports Entertainment Xtreme faction.<br/> <br/>-In July 2003, James formed the popular group known as the [[3Live Kru]] with [[Hispanic]] wrestler [[Konnan]] and the [[African-American]] wrestler K-Kwik, by then wrestling under his real name, [[Ron Killings]].  James was presented as a [[white trash]] [[redneck]].  The [[stable (professional wrestling)|group]] was popular from the outset and were notable for the fact that they sang their own entrance music as they approached the ring. The 3Live Kru turned out to be a successful gimmick as Killings held the NWA World Heavyweight Title for a second time and all three members enjoyed Tag Title reigns.<br/>+==Trivia==<br/>+Jakes is a first cousin twice removed of actor [[James Wheaton]] on his paternal side. He is also a distant cousin of commentator [[Tavis Smiley]] on his paternal side.<br/> <br/>-[[Image:4livekru.jpg|left|175px|thumb|3LK accepts [[Monty Sopp|Kip James]] into the group.]]<br/>-Tension arose when James' former partner Billy Gunn joined TNA as "The New Age Outlaw" (later shortened to "The Outlaw") in February 2005. The Outlaw repeatedly courted James, seeking to split the Kru and recreate the New Age Outlaws.  When The Outlaw began feuding with the Kru, James repeatedly found his loyalties divided, unwilling to fight either his former or current tag team partners. For a time, James stopped appearing with the Kru but did not align himself with The Outlaw who had by then changed his name to "Kip James" as a "tribute" to James' father. At ''[[TNA Sacrifice]]'' however, he reasserted his allegiance with 3LK as special guest referee in another match between the other members and the team of Kip James and Monty Brown.<br/>+Jakes is the subject of a new book by sociologist Shayne Lee entitled, T.D. Jakes: America's New Preacher, published by NYU Press.  The book presents Jakes' popularity as a metaphor of profound cultural and social changes in contemporary American Religion.<br/> <br/>-Kip James tried to warm up to 3LK again in the lead-up to [[TNA Bound For Glory|''Bound For Glory'']] by saving B.G. several times from [[Team Canada (professional wrestling)|Team Canada]]. At BFG, he offered his protective services to them against Team Canada (to neutralize [[Scott D'Amore]], as he said). They lost and Kip James came down, appearing ready to hit Konnan with a steel chair since he vetoed Kip's offer. Kip instead saved Konnan from Team Canada proving his original intentions.<br/>+t.d jakes is inbred and has seven toes<br/> <br/>-On the [[November 26]] episode of ''iMPACT!'', B.G. brought Kip and the 3LK to the ring and asked the Truth and Konnan to give Kip James a yes/no vote to be accepted into the group. After B.G. got heated with Konnan, both gave Kip yes votes and the "4Live Kru" was born.<br/>+he is smells<br/> <br/>-The 4Live Kru would be short lived as Konnan, still apparently upset at Kip James's induction into the Kru, bashed both B.G. and Kip over the head with a steel chair at [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling|TNA]]'s pay-per-view ''[[TNA Turning Point|Turning Point]]''. Konnan, still wanting Ron Killings to be his "family" tried talking with The Truth. Killings told Konnan that he was done with the Kru and wanted to leave it all behind him.<br/> <br/>-After the incident, B.G. and Kip regrouped, reforming their old tag team as '''The James Gang''' and feuding with Konnan's new stable, [[The Latin American Exchange]] which he formed with [[Nelson Erazo|Homicide]] and [[Germán Figueroa|Apolo]]. Apolo was sent home from the ''[[TNA Against All Odds|Against All Odds]]'' PPV after complaining about being used as a [[jobber]] and was quickly replaced by a relative unknown named [[Ricky Vega|Machete]]. LAX's membership has been in flux ever since.<br/>+justin is the best<br/> <br/>-On a recent edition of Impact, B.G.'s real life father [[Bob Armstrong|Bullet Bob Armstrong]] informed the James Gang that he was sick of the shenanigans of LAX and how they always used strength in numbers to their advantage. He informed them that he was going to see [[Larry Zbyszko]] to have himself added to the ''[[TNA Destination X|Destination X]]'' match as their partner, effectively making it a three-man tag. A despondent B.G. turned to Kip James and comically uttered "Mom is gonna KILL me!" He was in fact added and they won the match at Destination X.<br/>+==Books by T.D.

Bob Armstrong prevailed with the victory, so the LAX got whipped several times upon scramming out of the cage for survival.<br/>-<br/>-Following the LAX rivalry, B.G and Kip went after Team 3D, aka the [[Dudley Boyz]]. The two teams cut promos arguing over their long term histories with past promotions such as [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]] and [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|ECW]]. The rivalry came to a head at ''[[TNA Sacrifice#2006|TNA Sacrifice 2006]]'' when the James Gang beat Team 3D using a lead pipe. The James Gang and Team 3D would then feud throughout the summer. They were scheduled for a #1 contendership match at Hard Justice but due to a fire the match was canceled. The match was  redone on Impact but the Gang would not win.<br/>-<br/>-Over the past couple of weeks, B.G. has vocally disagreed with Kip over what kind of a man [[Jeff Jarrett]] is, stating on the Impact aired on [[October 19]], [[2006]] that Jarrett disregarded his stupidity over six early months of his career and took him in (obviously alluding to when he was The Roadie back in WWF). He claimed that Jarrett may be stand-offish as a wrestler, but he is "a damn good man".<br/>-<br/>-On the [[November 2]], 2006 edition of ''[[TNA iMPACT!]]'', Kip and B.G. James said they were going to quit. Kip James grabbed the mic and tried to say something to the TNA administration and Spike TV but each time his mic was cut off. Kip then tried to use the announcer's headset, but it was cut off as well. Frustrated, he started yelling loudly to the crowd but he was cut off as the show went to a commercial break. When the show returned, the announcers speculated that they may have been frustrated due to the influx of new talent entering TNA. It was reported recently that the segment was a [[shoot (professional wrestling)|worked shoot]] that [[Vince Russo]] had written in order to renew interest upon their eventual return. <ref>{{cite web | url = <br/>-http://rajah.com/base/node/6675 | title = TNA Interested In Trish Stratus; TNA Site Hacked, James Gang | accessdate = November 5 | accessyear = 2006 | author = Daniel Pena | date = 2006-11-04 }}</ref><br/>-<br/>-On the [[November 16]] airing of ''TNA iMPACT!'', The James Gang made an appearance with the new name of the Voodoo Kin Mafia or VKM. They spent their airtime bashing both members of D-Generation X, using their real names of Paul Levesque and Michael Hickenbottom, as well as Vince McMahon. After several demeaning statements about the two were made (including calling Triple H "Triple Hollywood" and Shawn Michaels "Shawn Kiss-My-Bottom"), VKM made claims of declaring war on both DX as well as Vincent Kennedy McMahon (VKM).  On the [[November 23]] airing of "iMPACT!" they went searching around for their target, but they ended up arriving at a [[Target]] store.  At the end of the episode it showed the Voo-Doo Kin Mafia arguing and Kip pointed in front of them where the WWE World Headquarters is.  B.G. then said, "We're back!". As acknoledged by TNA's Website, '''VKM''' has accepted [[The Hardy Boyz|The Hardys]] open challenge to a match at [[ECW]] [[December To Dismember]], however, the WWE have neither acknoledged or accepted their challenge. Over the last few weeks, VKM have aired several video's bashing DX and Vince Mcmahon.<br/>-<br/>-==Wrestling facts==<br/>-*'''Finishing and signature moves'''<br/>-:*'''[[Professional wrestling throws#Pumphandle drop|Pumphandle Drop]]<br/>-:*''Shake, Rattle and Roll'' ([[Jab|Combination jabs]])<br/>-:*''Shaky Knee Drop'' ([[Professional wrestling attacks#Knee drop|Dancing knee drop]])<br/>-:*[[Professional wrestling throws#Texas piledriver|Piledriver]]<br/>-<br/>-*'''Managers'''<br/>-:*Brandon Baxter<br/>-:*[[Konnan]]<br/>-:*[[Terri Poch|Tori]]<br/>-:* [[Bullet Bob Armstrong]]<br/>-<br/>-*'''Nicknames'''<br/>-:*B-Jizzle<br/>-:*The Real Double J<br/>-:*The Trailer Park Gangsta<br/>-<br/>-*'''Quotes'''<br/>-:*"Detroit Rock City!"<br/>-<br/>-==Championships and accomplishments==<br/>-*'''Atlantic Coast Championship Wrestling'''<br/>-:*ACCW Heavyweight Championship (1 time)<br/>-<br/>-*'''Continental Wrestling Federation'''<br/>-:*Continental Heavyweight Championship (1 time)<br/>-<br/>-*'''[[National Wrestling Alliance|NWA]] Wrestle Birmingham'''<br/>-:*[[NWA Alabama Heavyweight Championship]] (1 time)<br/>-<br/>-*'''[[Pro Wrestling Illustrated]]'''<br/>-:*PWI ranked him # '''183''' of the 500 best singles wrestlers of the [[PWI Years]] (2003)<br/>-:*PWI ranked him # '''43''' of the best tag teams of the PWI Years, with [[Monty Sopp|Billy Gunn]]<br/>-:*[[PWI Tag Team of the Year]], with Billy Gunn (1998)<br/>-<br/>-*'''[[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]]'''<br/>-:*[[NWA World Tag Team Championship]] ([[List of NWA World Tag Team Champions|2 times]]) &mdash; with [[Konnan]] (1) , and [[Ron Killings]] (1)<br/>-<br/>-*'''[[United States Wrestling Association]]'''<br/>-:*[[AWA Southern Heavyweight Championship|USWA Southern Heavyweight Championship]] (1 time)<br/>-:*[[USWA Television Championship]] (2 times)<br/>-:*[[USWA Tag Team Championship]] (2 times, with [[Tracy Smothers]])<br/>-<br/>-*'''[[World Wrestling All-Stars]]'''<br/>-:*[[WWA World Heavyweight Championship]] (1 time)<br/>-<br/>-*'''[[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]]'''<br/>-:*[[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Championship]] ([[List of WWE Intercontinental Champions|1 time]])<br/>-:*[[WWE Hardcore Championship|WWF Hardcore Championship]] ([[List of WWE Hardcore Champions|1 time]])<br/>-:*[[World Tag Team Championship|WWF World Tag Team Championship]] ([[List of World Tag Team Champions|5 times]], with [[Monty Sopp|Billy Gunn]])<br/>-<br/>-==Personal life==   <br/>-James has been married since 1997, and has three children: two biological daughters, and an adopted son. <br/>+I love to eat choclate every day and jacob cobseff goes to c.c.s ha ha ha now hes going to die<br/> <br/> ==References==<br/>-{{wikiquote}}<br/>-<references /><br/>-* [http://www.accelerator3359.com/Wrestling/bios/roaddogg.html B.G.

For other meanings, see [[Transformers]]''<br/>-<br/>-[[Image:PoleMountTransformer02.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Three-phase pole-mounted step-down transformer]]<br/>-A '''transformer''' is an [[electricity|electrical]] device that transfers energy from one circuit to another purely by [[magnetic]] [[Inductive coupling|coupling]]. Relative motion of the parts of the transformer is not required for transfer of energy.  Transformers are often used to convert between high and low [[voltage]]s, to change [[impedance]], and to provide electrical isolation between circuits. <br/>-<br/>-== Introduction ==<br/>-The transformer is one of the simplest of electrical devices. Its basic design, materials, and principles have changed little over the last one hundred years, yet transformer designs and materials continue to be improved. Transformers are essential in high voltage [[power transmission]] providing an economical means of transmitting power over large distances. The simplicity, reliability, and economy of conversion of voltages by transformers was the principal factor in the selection of [[alternating current]] power transmission in the "[[War of Currents]]" in the late 1880's.  In electronic circuitry, new methods of circuit design have replaced some of the applications of transformers, but electronic technology has also developed new transformer designs and applications.<br/>-<br/>-Transformers come in a range of sizes from a thumbnail-sized coupling transformer hidden inside a stage [[microphone]] to gigawatt units used to interconnect large portions of national power grids, all operating with the same basic principles and with many similarities in their parts.<br/>-<br/>-Transformers alone cannot do the following:<br/>-*Convert [[Direct current|DC]] to [[Alternating current|AC]] or vice versa <br/>-*Change the voltage or current of DC <br/>-*Change the AC supply [[frequency]]. <br/>-However, transformers are components of the systems that perform all these functions.<br/>-<br/>-==Basic principles==<br/>-<br/>-===An analogy ===<br/>-The transformer may be considered as  a simple two wheel 'gearbox' for electrical voltage and current. The primary winding is analogous to the input shaft and the secondary winding to the output shaft. In this comparison, voltage is equivalent to shaft speed, current to shaft torque. In a gearbox, mechanical power (speed multiplied by torque) is constant (neglecting losses) and is equivalent to electrical power (voltage multiplied by current) which is also constant. The gear ratio is equivalent to the transformer step up or down ratio.<br/>-<br/>-=== Flux coupling laws===<br/>-[[Image:Transformer3d.svg|right|thumb|400px|An idealised single-phase step-down transformer showing resultant flux in the core]]<br/>-A simple [[Single-phase electric power|single phase]] transformer consists of two electrical [[Electrical conduction|conductor]]s called the '''primary winding''' and the '''secondary winding'''. <br/>-If a time-varying voltage <math>{v_P}\, </math> is applied to the primary winding of <math>N_P\, </math> turns, a current will flow in it producing a [[magnetomotive force]] (MMF). Just as an [[electromotive force]] (EMF) tries to drive current around an electric circuit, so MMF tries to drive magnetic flux through a magnetic circuit. The primary MMF produces a varying [[magnetic flux]] <math>\Phi_P\, </math> in the core (shaded grey), and induces a back [[electromotive force]] (EMF) in opposition to <math>{v_P}\, </math>. In accordance with [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's Law]], the the rate of change of flux is proportional to the voltage across the primary winding :<br/>-<br/>-:::<math>{v_P} = {N_P} \frac {d \Phi_P}{dt}</math><br/>-<br/>-Similarly, the voltage induced across the secondary winding is:<br/>-<br/>-:::<math>{v_S} = {N_S} \frac {d \Phi_S}{dt}</math><br/>-<br/>-With perfect flux coupling, the flux in the secondary winding will be equal to that in the primary winding, and so we can equate <math>\Phi_P\, </math> and <math>\Phi_S\, </math>. It thus follows that:<br/>-<br/>-:::'''<math>\frac{v_P}{v_S}=\frac{N_P}{N_S}.</math>'''<br/>-<br/>-Hence in an ideal transformer, the [[ratio]] of the primary and secondary voltages is equal to the ratio of the [[coil|number of turns]] in their windings, or alternatively, the voltage per turn is the same for both windings. This leads to the most common use of the transformer: to convert electrical energy at one voltage to energy at a different voltage by means of windings with different numbers of turns.<br/>-<br/>-The EMF in the secondary winding, if connected to an electrical circuit, will cause current to flow in the secondary circuit. The  MMF produced by current in the secondary opposes the MMF of the primary and so tends to cancel the flux in the core. Since the reduced flux reduces the EMF induced in the primary winding, increased current flows in the primary circuit. The resulting increase in MMF due to the primary current offsets the effect of the opposing  secondary MMF.  In this way, the [[Electric power|electrical energy]] fed into the primary winding is delivered to the secondary winding. <br/>-<br/>-Neglecting losses, for a given level of power transferred through a transformer, current in the secondary circuit is inversely proportional to the ratio of secondary voltage to primary voltage. For example, suppose a power of 50 watts is supplied to a resistive load from a transformer with a turns ratio of 25:2.<br/>-*P = E&middot;I (power = electromotive force &middot; current)<br/>-50 W = 2 V &middot; 25 A in the primary circuit<br/>-* Now with transformer change:<br/>-50 W = 25 V &middot; 2 A in the secondary circuit.<br/>-<br/>-In a practical transformer, the higher-voltage winding will have more turns,of smaller conductor cross-section, than the lower-voltage windings. <br/>-<br/>-Since a DC voltage source would not give a time-varying flux in the core, no back EMF would be generated and so current flow into the transformer would be unlimited. In practice, the series resistance of the winding limits the amount of current that can flow, until the transformer either reaches thermal equilibrium or is destroyed. <br/>-<br/>-==== The Universal EMF equation ====<br/>-If the flux in the core is [[sinusoidal]], the relationship for either winding between its number of turns, voltage, [[magnetic flux density]] and core cross-sectional area is given by the universal emf equation:<br/>-<br/>-:::'''<math> E=4.44 \cdot f \cdot N \cdot a \cdot B</math>'''<br/>-<br/>-Where '''<math>E\, </math>''' is the sinusoidal [[root mean square]] voltage of the winding, '''<math>f\, </math>''' is the [[frequency]] in [[hertz]], '''<math>N\, </math>''' is the number of turns of wire,  '''<math>a\, </math>''' is the coss-sectional area of the core and '''<math>B\, </math>''' is the peak magnetic flux density in [[Tesla (unit)|tesla]]. The value 4.44 collects a number of constants required by the system of units.<br/>-<br/>-==Invention==<br/>-<br/>-Those credited with the invention of the transformer include:<br/>-<br/>-* [[Michael Faraday]], who invented an 'induction ring' on August 29, [[1831]].  This was the first transformer, although Faraday used it only to demonstrate the principle of [[electromagnetic induction]] and did not foresee the use to which it would eventually be put.<br/>-* [[Lucien Gaulard]] and [[John Dixon Gibbs]], who first exhibited a device called a 'secondary generator' in London in 1881 and then sold the idea to American company [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse]].  This may have been the first practical power transformer, but was not the first transformer of any kind.  They also exhibited the invention in [[Turin]] in 1884, where it was adopted for an electric lighting system.  Their early devices used a linear iron core, which was later abandoned in favour of a more efficient circular core.<br/>-* [[William Stanley (physicist)|William Stanley]], an engineer for Westinghouse, who built the first practical device in 1885 after George Westinghouse bought Gaulard and Gibbs' patents.  The core was made from interlocking E-shaped iron plates.  This design was first used commercially in 1886.<br/>-* [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[engineer]]s [[Ottó Bláthy]], [[Miksa Déri]] and [[Károly Zipernowsky]] at the [[Ganz company]] in [[Budapest]] in [[1885]], who created the efficient "ZBD" model based on the design by Gaulard and Gibbs.<br/>-* [[Nikola Tesla]] in [[1891]] invented the [[Tesla coil]], which is a high-voltage, air-core, dual-tuned resonant transformer for generating very high voltages at high frequency.<br/>-<br/>-==Practical considerations==<br/>-<br/>-===Classifications===<br/>-[[Image:Polemount-singlephase-closeup.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Single phase pole-mounted step-down transformer]]<br/>-<br/>-Transformers are adapted to numerous engineering applications and may be classified in many ways: <br/>-* By power level (from fraction of a watt to many megawatts),<br/>-* By application (power supply, impedance matching, circuit isolation),<br/>-* By frequency range (power, audio, RF)<br/>-* By voltage class (a few volts to about 750 kilovolts)<br/>-* By cooling type (air cooled, oil filled, fan cooled, water cooled, etc.)<br/>-* By purpose (rectifier, arc furnace, amplifier output, etc.).<br/>-* By ratio of the number of turns in the coils<br/>-:*'''Step-up'''<br/>-:: The secondary has more turns than the primary.<br/>-:*'''Step-down'''<br/>-:: The secondary has fewer turns than the primary.<br/>-:*'''Isolating'''<br/>-:: Intended to transform from one voltage to the same voltage. The two coils have approximately equal numbers of turns, although often there is a slight difference in the number of turns, in order to compensate for losses (otherwise the output voltage would be a little less than, rather than the same as, the input voltage).  <br/>-:*'''Variable'''<br/>-:: The primary and secondary have an adjustable number of turns which can be selected without reconnecting the transformer.<br/>-<br/>-[[Image:Transformer_01.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Three phase dry-type transformer with cover removed; rated about 200 KVA, 480 V]]<br/>-<br/>-===Losses===<br/>-<br/>-An ideal transformer would have no losses, and would therefore be 100% efficient. In practice energy is dissipated due both to the [[electrical resistance|resistance]] of the windings (known as ''copper loss''), and to magnetic effects primarily attributable to the core (known as ''iron loss''). Transformers are in general highly efficient, and large power transformers (around 100 MVA and larger) may attain an efficiency as high as 99.75%. Small transformers such as a plug-in "power brick" used to power small consumer electronics may be less than 85% efficient.<br/>-<br/>-The losses arise from:<br/>-<br/>-:* '''Winding resistance'''<br/>-:: Current flowing through the windings causes resistive heating of the conductors. <br/>-:* '''Eddy currents'''<br/>-:: Induced currents circulate in the core and cause its resistive heating.<br/>-:* '''Stray losses'''<br/>-:: Not all the magnetic field produced by the primary is intercepted by the secondary. A portion of the [[leakage flux]] may induce eddy currents within nearby conductive objects such as the transformer's support structure, and be converted to heat.  The familiar hum or buzzing noise heard near transformers is a result of stray fields causing components of the tank to vibrate, and is also from magnetostriction vibration of the core.<br/>-:*'''Hysteresis losses'''<br/>-:: Each time the magnetic field is reversed, a small amount of energy is lost to [[hysteresis]] in the magnetic core. The level of hysteresis is affected by the core material.<br/>-:* '''Mechanical losses'''<br/>-:: The alternating magnetic field causes fluctuating electromagnetic forces between the coils of wire, the core and any nearby metalwork, causing vibrations and noise which consume power.<br/>-:* '''Magnetostriction'''<br/>-:: The flux in the core causes it to physically expand and contract slightly with the alternating magnetic field, an effect known as [[magnetostriction]]. This in turn causes losses due to frictional heating in susceptible [[ferromagnetic]] cores. <br/>-:* '''Cooling system'''<br/>-:: Large power transformers may be equipped with cooling fans, oil pumps or water-cooled heat exchangers designed to remove the heat caused by copper and iron losses. The power used to operate the cooling system is typically considered part of the losses of the transformer.<br/>-<br/>-===High frequency operation===<br/>-The universal transformer emf equation indicates that at higher frequency, the core flux density will be lower for a given voltage. This implies that a core can have a smaller cross-sectional area and thus be physically more compact without reaching [[Saturation (magnetic)|saturation]]. It is for this reason that the aircraft manufacturers and the military use 400 hertz supplies. They are less concerned with efficiency, which is lower at higher frequencies (mostly due to increased hysteresis losses), but are more concerned with saving weight. Similarly, [[flyback transformer]]s which supply high voltage to [[cathode ray tube]]s operate at the frequency of the horizontal oscillator, many times higher than 50 or 60 hertz, which allows for a more compact component.<br/>-<br/>-== Construction ==<br/>-<br/>-===Cores===<br/>-==== Steel cores ====<br/>-[[Image:Transformer.filament.agr.jpg|thumb|300px|Laminated core transformer showing edge of lamination at top of unit.]]<br/>-Transformers for use at power or audio frequencies have cores made of many thin laminations of [[silicon steel]]. By concentrating the magnetic flux, more of it is usefully linked by both primary and secondary windings.  Since the steel core is conductive, it, too, has currents induced in it by the changing magnetic flux. Each layer is insulated from the adjacent layer to reduce the energy lost to [[eddy current]] heating of the core.  A typical laminated core is made from E-shaped and I-shaped pieces, leading to the name "EI transformer".  <br/>-<br/>-Certain types of transformer may have gaps inserted in the magnetic path to prevent [[Saturation (magnetic)|magnetic saturation]]. These gaps may be used to limit the current on a short-circuit, such as for [[neon sign]] transformers. <br/>-<br/>-A steel core's [[magnetic hysteresis]] means that it retains a static magnetic field when power is removed.  When power is then reapplied, the residual field will cause a high [[inrush current]] until the effect of the remanent magnetism is reduced, usually after a few cycles of the applied alternating current.  Overcurrent protection devices such as [[fuse (electrical)|fuses]] must be selected to allow this harmless inrush to pass. On transformers connected to long  overhead power transmission lines, induced currents due to geomagnetic disturbances during solar storms can cause saturation of the core, and false operation of transformer [[relay|protection devices]]. <br/>-<br/>-Distribution transformers can achieve low off-load losses by using cores made with amorphous (non-crystalline) steel, so-called "[[Amorphous#Metallic_glass|metal glasses]]" - the high cost of the core material is offset by the lower losses incurred at light load, over the life of the transformer.<br/>-<br/>-==== Solid cores ====<br/>-In circuits that operate above mains frequencies, up to a few tens of kilohertz, such as switch-mode power supplies, powdered iron cores are used. These materials combine a high magnetic [[permeability]] with a high bulk material resistivity. At even higher frequencies, typically radio frequencies, other types of core made of non-conductive magnetic materials, such as various [[ceramic]] materials called ''[[ferrite (magnet)|ferrites]]'', are common. Some transformers in [[radio]]-frequency circuits have adjustable cores which allow tuning of the coupling circuit.<br/>-<br/>-==== Air cores ====<br/>-High-frequency transformers may also use air cores. These eliminate the loss due to [[hysteresis]] in the core material. Such transformers maintain high coupling efficiency (low stray field loss) by overlapping the primary and secondary windings.<br/>-<br/>-==== Toroidal cores ====<br/>-Toroidal transformers are built around a ring-shaped core, which is made from a long strip of silicon [[steel]] or [[permalloy]] wound into a coil, or from [[ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]], depending on frequency. This construction ensures that all the [[grain boundary|grain boundaries]] are pointing in the optimum direction, making the transformer more efficient by reducing the core's [[reluctance]], and eliminates the air gaps inherent in the construction of an EI core.  The cross-section of the ring is usually square or rectangular, but more expensive cores with circular cross-sections are also available.  The primary and secondary coils are wound concentrically to cover the entire surface of the core.  This minimises the length of wire needed, and also provides screening to prevent the core's magnetic field from generating [[electromagnetic interference]]. <br/>-<br/>-Toroidal cores for use at frequencies up to a few tens of kilohertz may also be made of ferrite material to reduce losses.  Such transformers are used in switch-mode power supplies.<br/>-<br/>-Toroidal transformers are more efficient (around 95%) than the cheaper laminated EI types.  Other advantages, compared to EI types,  include smaller size (about half), lower weight (about half), less mechanical hum (making them superior in audio amplifiers), lower exterior magnetic field (about one tenth), low off-load losses (making them more efficient in standby circuits), single-bolt mounting, and more choice of shapes.  This last point means that, for a given power output, either a wide, flat [[toroid]] or a tall, narrow one with the same electrical properties can be chosen, depending on the space available.  The main disadvantage is higher cost.  <br/>-<br/>-A drawbacks of toroidal transformer construction is the higher cost of windings.  As a consequence, toroidal transformers are uncommon above ratings of a few kVA. Small distribution transformers may achieve some of the benefits of a torodial core by splitting it and forcing it open, then inserting a bobbin containg primary and secondary windings. <br/>-<br/>-When fitting a toroidal transformer, it is important to avoid making an unintentional [[short-circuit]] through the core (e.g. by carelessly fitting a steel mounting bolt through the middle and fastening it to metalwork at both ends).  <br/>-<br/>-=== Windings ===<br/>-In most practical transformers, the primary and secondary conductors are coils of conducting [[wire]] because each turn of the coil contributes to the [[magnetic field]], creating a higher [[magnetic flux density]] than would a single conductor.<br/>-<br/>-The winding material depends on the application.  Small power and signal transformers are wound with insulated solid copper wire, often [[Enameled wire|enameled]]. Larger power transformers may be wound with wire, copper or aluminum rectangular conductors, or strip conductors for very heavy currents. High frequency transformers operating in the tens to hundreds of kilohertz will have windings made of [[Skin effect#Mitigation|Litz wire]], to minimize the skin effect losses in the conductors. Large power transformers use multiply-stranded conductors as well, since even at low power frequencies non-uniform distribution of current would otherwise exist in large windings.  Each strand is insulated from the others, and the strands are arranged so that either at certain points in the winding or throughout the winding, each portion occupies different relative positions in the complete conductor. This "transposition" equalises the current flowing in each strand of the conductor, and reduces [[eddy current]] losses in the winding itself. The stranded conductor is also more flexible than a solid conductor of similar size. ( see reference (1) below)<br/>-<br/>-Windings on both primary and secondary of a power transformer may have taps to allow adjustment of the voltage ratio; taps may be connected to automatic on-load [[tap changer]] [[switchgear]] for [[Voltage regulator|voltage regulation]] of [[Power distribution|distribution]] circuits.  Audio-frequency transformers used for distribution of audio to public address loudspeakers have taps to allow adjustment of power supplied to each speaker. A center-tapped transformer is often used in the output stage of an audio power [[amplifier]] in a [[push-pull]] circuit.  Tapped transformers are also used as components of amplifiers, oscillators, and for [[feedback]] linearization of amplifier circuits.<br/>-<br/>-=== Insulation ===<br/>-The conductor material must have insulation to ensure the current travels around the core, and not through a turn-to-turn short-circuit.<br/>-<br/>-In power transformers, the voltage difference between parts of the primary and secondary windings can be quite large. Insulation is  inserted between layers of windings to prevent arcing, and the transformer may also be immersed in [[transformer oil]] that provides further insulation and acts as a cooling medium.<br/>-<br/>-=== Shielding ===<br/>-Although an ideal transformer is purely magnetic in operation, the proximity of the primary and secondary windings can create a mutual capacitance between the windings. Where transformers are intended for high electrical isolation between primary and secondary circuits, an electrostatic shield can be placed between windings to minimize this effect.<br/>-<br/>-Transformers may also be enclosed by magnetic shields, electrostatic shields, or both to prevent outside interference from affecting the operation of the transformer, or to prevent the transformer from affecting the operation of other devices (such as [[Cathode ray tube|CRTs]] in proximity to the transformer). <br/>-<br/>-=== Coolant ===<br/>-All transformers must have some circulation of [[coolant]] to remove the waste heat produced by losses. Small transformers up to a few kilowatts in size usually are adequately cooled by air circulation. Larger "dry" type transformers may have cooling fans. Some dry transformers are enclosed in pressurized tanks and are cooled by [[nitrogen]] or [[sulfur hexafluoride]] gas. <br/>-<br/>-The windings of high-power or high-voltage transformers are immersed in [[transformer oil]] - a highly-refined [[mineral oil]] that is stable at high temperatures. Large transformers to be used indoors must use a non-flammable liquid. Formerly, [[polychlorinated biphenyl]] (PCB) was used as it was not a fire hazard in indoor power transformers and it is highly stable. Due to the stability of PCB and its environmental accumulation, it is no longer permitted in new equipment.  Today, nontoxic, stable [[silicone]]-based oils or [[fluorocarbon|fluorinated hydrocarbon]]s may be used, where the expense of a fire-resistant liquid offsets additional building cost for a transformer vault. Other less-flammable fluids such as [[canola oil]] may be used but all fire resistant fluids have some drawbacks in performance, cost, or toxicity compared with mineral oil.<br/>-<br/>-The oil cools the transformer, and provides part of the electrical insulation between internal live parts. It has to be stable at high temperatures so that a small short or arc will not cause a breakdown or fire. The oil-filled tank may have radiators through which the oil circulates by natural convection. Very large or high-power transformers (with capacities of millions of [[watt]]s) may have cooling fans, oil pumps and even oil to water [[heat exchangers]]. Oil-filled transformers undergo prolonged drying processes, using vapor-phase heat transfer, electrical self-heating, the application of a [[vacuum]], or combinations of these,  to ensure that the transformer is completely free of [[water vapor]] before the cooling oil is introduced. This helps prevent electrical breakdown under load.<br/>-<br/>-Oil-filled power transformers may be equipped with [[Buchholz relay]]s - safety devices sensing gas buildup inside the transformer (a side effect of an [[electric arc]] inside the windings) and switching off the transformer.<br/>-<br/>-Experimental power transformers in the 2 MVA range have been built with [[superconductivity|superconducting]] windings which eliminates the copper losses, but not the core steel loss. These are cooled by liquid [[nitrogen]] or [[helium]].<br/>-<br/>-===Terminals===<br/>-Very small transformers will have wire leads connected directly to the ends of the coils, and brought out to the base of the unit for circuit connections. Larger transformers may have heavy bolted terminals, bus bars or high-voltage insulated [[Bushing (electrical)|bushings]] made of polymers or porcelain.  A large bushing can be a complex structure since it must both provide electrical insulation, and contain oil within the transformer tank.<br/>-<br/>-===Enclosure===<br/>-Small transformers often have no enclosure. Transformers may have a shield enclosure, as described above. Larger units  may be enclosed to prevent contact with live parts, and to contain the cooling medium (oil or pressurized gas). <br/>-<br/>-== Transformer designs ==<br/>-<br/>-=== Autotransformers ===<br/>-{{main|Autotransformer}}<br/>-An [[autotransformer]] has only a single winding, which is tapped at some point along the winding. AC or pulsed voltage is applied across a portion of the winding, and a higher (or lower) voltage is produced across another portion of the same winding. For voltage ratios not exceeding about 3:1, an autotransformer is less costly, lighter, smaller and more efficient than a two-winding transformer of a similar rating.<br/>-<br/>-By exposing part of the winding coils and making the secondary connection through a sliding [[brush (electric) | brush]], an autotransformer with a near-continuously variable turns ratio can be obtained, allowing for very small increments of voltage.<br/>-<br/>-=== Polyphase transformers ===<br/>-[[Image:Wye_Delta_01.png|300px|thumb|right|Wye and delta winding connections]]<br/>-For [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase power]], three separate single-phase transformers can be used, or all three phases can be connected to a single polyphase transformer. The three primary windings are connected together and the three secondary windings are connected together. The most common connections are Y-Δ, Δ-Y, Δ-Δ and Y-Y. A [[vector group]] indicates the configuration of the windings and the [[phase angle]] difference between them. If a winding is connected to earth (grounded), the earth connection point is usually the center point of a Y winding. There are many possible configurations that may involve more or fewer than six windings and various tap connections.<br/>-<br/>-=== Resonant transformers ===<br/>-A [[resonance|resonant]] transformer is one that operates at the [[resonant frequency]] of one or more of its coils.  The resonant coil, usually the secondary, acts as an [[inductor]], and is connected in series with a [[capacitor]].  If the primary coil is driven by a periodic source of [[alternating current]], such as a square or sawtooth wave, each pulse of current helps to build up an oscillation in the secondary coil.  Due to resonance, a very high voltage can develop across the secondary, until it is limited by some process such as [[electrical breakdown]].  These devices are therefore used to generate high alternating voltages.  The current available from this type of coil can be much larger than that from electrostatic machines such as the [[Van de Graaff generator]] and [[Wimshurst machine]]. They also run at a higher operating temperature than standard units.<br/>-<br/>-Examples:-<br/>-*[[Tesla coil]]<br/>-*[[Oudin coil]] (or Oudin resonator; named after its inventor [[Paul Oudin]])<br/>-*[[Jacques Arsene d'Arsonval|D'Arsonval]] apparatus<br/>-*[[ignition coil]] or [[induction coil]] used in the [[ignition system]] of a [[petrol engine]]<br/>-*[[Flyback transformer]] of a [[CRT]] [[television]] set or video monitor.<br/>-<br/>-Other applications of resonant transformers are as coupling between stages of a [[superheterodyne receiver]], where the selectivity of the receiver is provided by the tuned transformers of the intermediate-frequency amplifiers.<br/>-<br/>-A voltage regulating transformer uses a resonant winding and allows part of the core to go into saturation on each cycle of the alternating current. This effect stabilizes the output of the regulating transformer, which can be used for equipment that is sensitive to variations of the supply voltage. Saturating transformers provide a simple rugged method to stabilize an ac power supply. However, due to the hysteresis losses accompanying this type of operation, efficiency is low.<br/>-<br/>-===Instrument transformers===<br/>-====Current transformers====<br/>-[[Image:CurrentTransformers.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Current transformers used as part of [[electricity meter|metering equipment]] for [[three-phase]] 400 ampere electricity supply]]A '''current transformer''' is designed to provide a current in its secondary which is accurately  proportional to the current flowing in its primary.<br/>-<br/>-Current transformers are commonly used in [[electricity meter]]s to facilitate the measurement of large currents which would be difficult to measure more directly.<br/>-<br/>-Care must be taken that the secondary of a current transformer is not disconnected from its load while current is flowing in the primary as in this circumstance a very high voltage would be produced across the secondary.<br/>-<br/>-Current transformers are often constructed with a single primary turn either as an insulated cable passing through a toroidal core, or else as a bar to which circuit conductors are connected.<br/>-<br/>-====Voltage transformers====<br/>-Voltage transformers (also known as potential transformers) are used in the electricity supply industry to measure accurately the voltage being supplied. They are designed to present negligible load to the voltage being measured.<br/>-<br/>-=== Pulse transformers ===<br/>-A '''pulse transformer''' is a transformer that is optimised for transmitting rectangular electrical pulses (that is, pulses with fast rise and fall times and a constant [[amplitude]]).  Small versions called ''signal'' types are used in [[digital logic]] and [[telecommunications]] circuits, often for matching logic drivers to [[transmission line]]s.  Medium-sized ''power'' versions are used in power-control circuits such as [[camera flash]] controllers.  Larger ''power'' versions are used in the [[electrical power distribution]] industry to interface low-voltage control circuitry to the high-voltage gates of [[Power semiconductor device|power semiconductor]]s such as [[TRIAC]]s, [[IGBT]]s, [[thyristor]]s and [[MOSFET]]s. Special [[high voltage]] pulse transformers are also used to generate high power pulses for [[radar]], [[particle accelerators]], or other [[pulsed power]] applications.<br/>-<br/>-To minimise distortion of the pulse shape, a pulse transformer needs to have low values of leakage inductance and distributed capacitance, and a high open-circuit inductance.  In power-type pulse transformers, a low coupling capacitance (between the primary and secondary) is important to protect the circuitry on the primary side from high-powered transients created by the load.  For the same reason, high insulation resistance and high breakdown voltage are required.  A good transient response is necessary to maintain the rectangular pulse shape at the secondary, because a pulse with slow edges would create switching losses in the power semiconductors.<br/>-<br/>-The product of the peak pulse voltage and the duration of the pulse (or more accurately, the voltage-time integral) is often used to characterise pulse transformers.  Generally speaking, the larger this product, the larger and more expensive the transformer.<br/>-<br/>-===RF transformers ===<br/>-For [[radio frequency]] use, transformers are sometimes made from configurations of transmission line, sometimes [[bifilar]] or [[coaxial]] cable, wound around [[ferrite]] cores. This style of transformer gives an extremely wide [[bandwidth]], however only a limited number of ratios (such as 1:9, 1:4 or 1:2) can be achieved with this technique. The ferrite increases the inductance dramatically while also lowering its [[Q factor]]. The cores of such transformers help performance at the lower frequency end of the band. This style of transformer is frequently used as an [[impedance matching]] [[balun]] to convert from 300 ohm balanced to 75 ohm unbalanced in FM receivers.<br/>-<br/>-== Uses of transformers ==<br/>-* [[Electric power transmission]] over long distances. <br/>-* High-voltage direct-current [[HVDC]] power transmission systems<br/>-* Large, specially constructed power transformers are used for [[electric arc furnace]]s used in [[steelmaking]].<br/>-* Rotating transformers are designed so that one winding turns while the other remains stationary. A common use was the video head system as used in VHS and Beta video tape players. These can pass power or radio signals from a stationary mounting to a rotating mechanism, or [[radar]] [[antenna (electronics)|antenna]].<br/>-* Sliding transformers can pass power or signals from a stationary mounting to a moving part such as a machine tool head. See [[linear variable differential transformer]], <br/>-* Some rotary transformers are precisely constructed in order to measure distances or angles. Usually they have a single primary and two or more secondaries, and electronic circuits measure the different amplitudes of the currents in the secondaries. See [[synchro]] and [[Resolver (electrical)|resolver]].<br/>-* Small transformers are often used to isolate and link different parts of  [[radio receiver]]s and [[audio amplifier]]s, converting high current low voltage circuits to low current high voltage, or vice versa. See [[electronics]] and [[impedance matching]]. See also [[isolation transformer]] and [[repeating coil]].<br/>-* Balanced-to-unbalanced conversion.  A special type of transformer called a [[balun]] is used in radio and audio circuits to convert between balanced circuits and unbalanced [[transmission line]]s such as antenna downleads.

In the years that followed, he oversaw the transformation of Cuba into the first [[Communist state]] in the [[Western Hemisphere]].<br/>+<br/>+Castro first attracted attention in Cuban political life through his student [[activism]]. His outspoken [[nationalism]] and his radical critique of Batista and [[United States|US]] corporate and political influence in Cuba had a mixed reception. He gained a following, but also faced significant criticism and drew the attention of the authorities. Later, his leadership of the 1953 attack on the [[Moncada Barracks]], subsequent exile, and eventual [[guerrilla]] invasion of Cuba in December 1956 cemented his fame worldwide. Since his accession to power in 1959, he has maintained a high and controversial profile. Inciting much condemnation, praise and debate, Castro is a highly controversial figure that is viewed as a legitimate and popular leader by some and as a [[dictator]] by others.<br/>+<br/>+On an international level, Castro has had many ties with both the [[United States]] and the former [[Soviet Union]]. After the failed American-directed [[Bay of Pigs invasion]] of Cuba in [[1961]], his leadership has been marked by tensions with the United States. He formed a close partnership with the Soviet Union until its collapse in [[1991]]. This partnership resulted in the [[1962]] [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] and foreign intervention of many countries of the [[third world]]. Domestically, he has overseen the implementation of various [[land reform]] policies which led to the [[collectivization]] of agriculture, [[nationalization]] of leading [[Economy of Cuba|Cuban industries]], and the availability of [[Publicly-funded health care|free health care]] and [[free education]].<br/>+<br/>+==Childhood and education==<br/>+[[Image:R2247968516.jpg|thumb|left|250px|University student Fidel Castro (third from the left, standing) talking to fellow students during a protest on [[November 11]], [[1947]].]]<br/>+<br/>+Fidel Alejandro Castro Ruz was born on a sugar plantation near Birán, in the municipality of Cueto, Holguin, Cuba.

A charismatic and emotional figure, Chibás was running for president against the incumbent [[Ramón Grau San Martín]] who had allowed rampant corruption to flourish during his term. The Partido Ortodoxos publically exposed corruption and demanded government and social reform. It aimed to instill a strong sense of national identity among Cubans, establish Cuban economic independence and freedom from the United States, and dismantle the power of the elite over Cuban politics. Though Chibás lost the election, Castro, considering Chibás his mentor, remained committed to his cause, working fervently on his behalf. In 1951, while running for president again, Chibás shot himself in the stomach during a radio broadcast.

In [[1948]] Castro traveled to [[Bogotá]] in [[Colombia]]  for a political conference of Latin American students that coincided with the ninth meeting of the [[Pan-American Union]] Conference.  The students were using this opportunity to distribute pamphlets protesting United States dominance of the Western Hemisphere and to foment discontent. A few days later the populist [[Colombian Liberal Party]] leader [[Jorge Eliecer Gaitán]] was assassinated, triggering massive riots in the streets in which many (mostly poor workers) were injured or killed. Rioting and looting spread to other cities in Colombia, beginning an era of turbulence in Colombia that became known as [[La Violencia]]. It appears that the students were caught up in the violence and chaos rocking the city, picking up rifes and roaming the streets distributing anti-United States material and stirring a revolt.  When Castro was pursued by the Columbian authorities for his role in the riots, he took refuge in the Cuban Embassy and was flown back to Havana.<br/>+<ref>{{cite web<br/>+| last = Castro<br/>+| first = Fidel<br/>+| date = 1982-04-11<br/>+| url = http://lanic.utexas.edu/la/cb/cuba/castro/1982/19820411<br/>+| title = Fidel Castro reveals role in 9 april 1948 Colombian uprising<br/>+| format = HTML<br/>+| work = Bogota el Siglo<br/>+| publisher = <br/>+| accessdate = 2006-05-11<br/>+}}</ref><br/>+<ref>{{cite web<br/>+| last = Suchlicki<br/>+| first = James<br/>+| date = February 2003<br/>+| url = http://www.cubacenter.org/media/news_articles/fidel_us.php3<br/>+| title = Fidel Castro on the United States - Forward<br/>+| format = HTML<br/>+| work = <br/>+| publisher = Center for a Free Cuba<br/>+| accessdate = 2006-05-11<br/>+}}</ref> It seems clear that experiencing the power of mob violence and insurection had an effect on Castro and influenced his subsequent political thinking.<br/>+<br/>+Castro returned to Cuba and married Mirta Díaz Balart, a student from another wealthy Cuban family. In [[1950]] he graduated from law school with a Doctor of Laws degree and began practicing law in a small partnership in Havana, mostly representing the poor and underprivileged. By now he had become well known for his passionately [[nationalism|nationalist]]ic views and his intense opposition to the influence of the United States on Cuban internal affairs. Increasingly interested in a career in politics,  Castro had become a candidate for a seat in the Cuban [[parliament]] when General [[Fulgencio Batista]] led a [[coup d'état]] in [[1952]], successfully overthrowing the government of President [[Carlos Prío Socarrás]] and canceling the election. <br/>+<br/>+Batista established himself as dictator with the support of establishment elements of Cuban society and powerful Cuban agencies. His regime was formally recognized by the United States, cementing his power. These events effectively ended Castro's chances of pursuing a legitimate political career in Cuba.<br/>+<br/>+Frustrated, Castro broke away from the Partido Ortodoxo and marshaled legal arguments based on the Constitution of 1940 to formally charge Batista with violating the Cuban [[constitution]]. His petition was denied by the Court of Constitutional Guarantees and he was not allowed a hearing.

Although on paper heavily outnumbered, Castro's  guerrilla forces scored a series of victories, largely aided by mass desertions from Batista's army of poorly trained and uncommitted young conscripts.  During the [[Battle of La Plata]], Castro's forces defeated an entire battalion.

In April 1961, they launched the infamous Bay of Pigs - an attempt to topple Castro by recruiting a private army of Cuban exiles to invade the island.<br/>+<br/>+But Castro repulsed the invaders, killing many, capturing a thousand and bloodying the nose of a superpower in the process. <br/>+<br/>+Castro consolidated control of the nation by nationalizing industry, expropriating property owned by Cubans and non-Cubans alike, collectivizing agriculture, and enacting policies which he claimed would benefit the population. In 1959, following President Eisenhower's ban on the importation of Cuban sugar into the U.S., Castro nationalized some $850 million worth of U.S. property and businesses.<br/>+<br/>+<br/>+<br/>+On [[April 15]] Castro went on a famous twelve-day unofficial tour of the US, where he met [[Malcolm X]], [[Egypt]]ian President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] and [[India]]n Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] while staying in a cheap hotel in [[Harlem]] - an example of his tendency to 'mix with the people', as he later also did in [[Panamá]], where he used the service entrance of the hotel more than the front door. He subsequently visited the [[White House]] and met with [[Vice President]] [[Richard Nixon]]. Sometime during this period Castro spoke for his first time to members of the [[Council of Foreign Relations]]. <br/>+<br/>+Castro's economic policies had caused some concerns in [[Washington]] that Castro was a [[Communist]] with an allegiance to the [[Soviet Union]]. Supposedly, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] snubbed Castro, giving the excuse that he was playing [[golf]], and left Nixon to speak to him. Following the meeting, Nixon remarked that Castro was "either incredibly naïve about Communism or under Communist discipline — my guess is the former. " Castro spent two days in [[Canada]], initiating a friendship with future Canadian Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]].<br/>+<br/>+Friction with the US soon developed when, in May 1959, the new government began expropriating US-owned property (much owned by US-owned corporations, such as the [[United Fruit Company]]) in accordance with the [[First Agrarian Reform Law]]. Compensation for the expropriated properties was based on their declared property tax value, which, for many years, the same companies had managed to keep artificially low. In June 1960, Eisenhower reduced Cuba's sugar import quota by 700,000 tons, and in response, Cuba [[nationalization|nationalized]] some $850 million worth of US property and businesses. The revolutionary government consolidated control of the nation by nationalizing industry, expropriating property owned by Cubans and non-Cubans alike, collectivizing [[agriculture]], and enacting policies which it claimed would benefit the population. These policies alienated many former supporters of the revolution among the Cuban middle and upper-classes, who made up roughly half of the Cuban population. Over one million Cubans later migrated to the US, forming a vocal anti-Castro community in [[Miami, Florida]] [[Cuban-American lobby]].<br/>+<br/>+According to Andrew and Gordievsky (1990) as early as July 1959 Castro's intelligence chief Ramiro Valdés contacted the KGB in Mexico City, the USSR sent over one hundred mostly Spanish speaking advisors; including [[Enrique Lister]] Farjan to organize the [[Committees for the Defense of the Revolution]].  In February 1960 Cuba signed an agreement to buy oil from the USSR. When the US-owned refineries in Cuba refused to process the oil, they were expropriated, and the United States broke off diplomatic relations with the Castro government soon afterward. To the concern of the Eisenhower administration, Cuba began to establish closer ties with the Soviet Union. A variety of pacts were signed between Castro and [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Soviet Premier]] [[Nikita Khrushchev]], allowing Cuba to receive large amounts of economic and military aid from them.<br/>+<br/>+===Bay of Pigs===<br/>+{{main|Bay of Pigs Invasion}}<br/>+On [[April 15]], [[1961]], the day after Castro described his revolution as [[socialism|socialist]], four Cuban airfields were bombed by [[A-26 Invader|A-26s]] bearing false Cuban markings. These bombing runs were the beginning stages of the Bay of Pigs invasion. Cuban exiles funded and trained by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] staged an unsuccessful attack on Cuba on [[17 April]], [[1961]]. Assault Brigade 2506, a force of about 1,400 Cuban exiles, commanded by Cuban Manuel Artime and CIA operatives [[Grayston Lynch]] and [[William Robertson (CIA)|William Robertson]], landed perhaps a hundred miles south-east of Havana, at [[Playa Girón]] on the Bay of Pigs. Under the leadership of Stephen Penney, the CIA assumed that the invasion would spark a popular uprising against Castro; the operation itself was expected by Castro, however, and in anticipation the government rounded up perhaps 100,000 (Lynch reports 250,000) anti-Castro Cubans -at least 20,000 in Havana alone (Priestland, 2003), executed some and imprisoned the others under threat of death should the invasion succeed. Led by Erneido Oliva, most of the 1,200 men invasion force  made it ashore; however, reserve ammunition in two US supplied support ships, the ''Houston'' and the ''Río Escondido'', sunk by Cuban Air Force [[Sea Fury]] propeller-driven aircraft and [[T-33]] Jets, was lost. President [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] was influenced by some State Department officials including [[Roy Rubottom]] and especially his assistant [[William Weiland]] who had been  involved in Castro related matters since the [[Bogotazo]] and in Cuban matters 1933 as assistant to [[Sumner Welles]]. Kennedy withdrew support for the invasion at the last minute, by canceling several bombing sorties that could have crippled the entire Cuban Air Force. The cancellation also prevented US Marines waiting off the coast from landing in support of the Cuban exiles. After three days of ferocious fighting in which about 100 invaders and perhaps 2,000 militia, perhaps 5000 according to Lynch, more died (most trapped in buses on the causeways), the rest of the invaders were captured. <ref>{{cite web<br/>+| last = Fontova<br/>+| first = Humberto<br/>+| date = 2002-04-29<br/>+| url = http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2002/4/29/34913.shtml<br/>+| title = The Bay of Pigs – The Truth<br/>+| format = HTML<br/>+| publisher = newsmax.com<br/>+| accessdate = 2006-05-11<br/>+}}</ref> At least nine invaders were formally executed in connection with this action, however, a number died of suffocation in an unventilated truck trailer, while Castro attributed the defeat of the invasion to his leadership.<br/>+<br/>+In a nationally broadcast speech on [[December 2]], [[1961]], Castro declared that he was a [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] and that Cuba was going to adopt [[Communism]]. On [[February 7]], [[1962]], the US imposed an [[United States embargo against Cuba|embargo against Cuba]], which included a general travel ban for American tourists.<br/>+<br/>+===Cuban Missile Crisis===<br/>+{{main|Cuban Missile Crisis}}<br/>+Tensions between Castro and US heightened during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, which nearly brought the US and the USSR to direct confrontation. Khrushchev conceived the idea of placing missiles in Cuba as a deterrent to a US invasion. After consultations with his military advisors, he met with a Cuban delegation led by Raúl Castro in July in order to work out the specifics. It was agreed to deploy Soviet [[R-12]] [[MRBM]]s on Cuban soil; however, American [[Lockheed U-2]] reconnaissance discovered the construction of the missile installations on [[15 October]], [[1962]] before the weapons had actually been deployed. The US government viewed the installation of Soviet nuclear weapons 90 miles south of [[Key West]] as an aggressive act and a threat to US security. As a result, the US publicly announced its discovery on [[22 October]], [[1962]], and implemented a [[quarantine]] around Cuba that would actively intercept and search any vessels heading for the island.

Castro was able to build a formidable military force with the help of Soviet equipment and military advisors. The [[KGB]] kept in close touch with Havana, and Castro tightened Communist Party control over all levels of government, the media, and the educational system, while developing a Soviet-style internal police force.<br/>+<br/>+Castro's alliance with the Soviet Union caused something of a split between him and Guevara, who took a more pro-[[China|Chinese]] view following ideological conflict between the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU]] and the [[Maoism|Maoist]] [[Communist Party of China|CPC]]. In 1966, Guevara left for [[Bolivia]] in an ill-fated attempt to stir up revolution against the country's government.<br/>+<br/>+On [[23 August]], [[1968]] Castro made a public gesture to the Soviet Union that reaffirmed their support in him. Two days after the Soviet invasion of [[Czechoslovakia]] to repress the [[Prague Spring]], Castro took to the airwaves and publicly denounced the Czech rebellion. Castro warned the Cuban people about the Czechoslovakian 'counterrevolutionaries', who "were moving Czechoslovakia towards capitalism and into the arms of [[imperialism|imperialists]]". He called the leaders of the rebellion "the agents of [[West Germany]] and [[fascist]] reactionary rabble." In return for his public backing of the invasion, at a time when many Soviet allies were deeming the invasion an infringement of Czechoslovakia's sovereignty, the Soviets bailed out the Cuban economy with extra loans and an immediate increase in oil exports.<br/>+<br/>+In 1971, following the re-establishment of diplomatic relations with [[Cuba]], despite a previously established [[Organization of American States]] convention that no nation in the [[Western Hemisphere]] would do so (the only exception being [[Mexico]], which had refused to adopt that convention), Cuban President Fidel Castro took a month-long visit to Chile. The visit, in which Castro participated actively in the internal politics of the country, holding massive rallies and giving public advice to Allende, was seen by those on the political right as proof to support their view that "The Chilean Way to Socialism" was an effort to put Chile on the same path as Cuba.<br/>+<br/>+On [[November 4]], [[1975]], Castro ordered the deployment of Cuban troops to [[Angola]] in order to aid the Marxist [[Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola|MPLA]]-ruled government against the [[National Union for Total Independence of Angola|UNITA]] opposition forces, which gained the support of the government of [[South Africa]]. Moscow aided the Cuban initiative with the USSR engaging in a massive airlift of Cuban forces into Angola.

Dr. Eugenio Selman Housein said that the "press is always speculating about something, that he had a heart attack once, that he had cancer, some neurological problem", but maintained that Castro was in good health. <ref>{{cite news<br/>+| last = <br/>+| first = <br/>+| date = 2004-05-19<br/>+| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3761748.stm<br/>+| title = Castro breaks knee, arm in fall<br/>+| format = HTML<br/>+| publisher = BBC News<br/>+| accessdate = 2006-05-14<br/>+}}</ref><br/>+<br/>+On [[20 October]] [[2004]], Castro fell off a stage following a speech he gave at a rally.<ref>{{cite news<br/>+| last = <br/>+| first = <br/>+| date = 2004-09-24<br/>+| url = http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/05/18/1084783511071.html<br/>+| title = Fidel Castro can live to 140, doctor says<br/>+| format = HTML<br/>+| publisher = The Sydney Morning Herald<br/>+| accessdate = 2006-05-11<br/>+}}</ref><br/>+The fall fractured his knee and arm.

The following month, he stood unassisted for several minutes during a visit by Venezuelan President [[Hugo Chávez]]. A smiling Castro walked in public for the first time since shattering his kneecap in the fall after several weeks out of public view. Legislators looked stunned, then smiled and applauded, when Castro entered the main auditorium of the Convention Palace. He was supported by holding the arm of a uniformed schoolgirl as he entered. Because of his large role in Cuba, his well-being has become a continual source of speculation, both on and off the island, as he has grown older.

She is also the most famous face of lingerie giant [[Victoria's Secret]]. Since her appearence on the fashion scene in the 90's she became the most sought-after [[supermodel]] on the planet, and appeared in<br/>-countless [[billboards]] and more than 7,000 magazine covers. Gisele is currently the face of 20 brands from different countries like [[Brazil]], [[Italy]], [[United States]], [[France]], [[Mexico]], [[Spain]], [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]]. She is also the highest paid [[model]] in the business - a title that she commands for five straight years - and she made $30 million between june of 2005 and june of 2006. [http://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/53/2VPP.html]<br/>+Was wondering how to add [[Shopfront]] into the theatre stubs page or perhaps creating a new stub [[User:Kevinng88|Kevinng88]] 06:06, 10 October 2006 (UTC)<br/> <br/>-==Biography==<br/>-Gisele was born in the southern Brazilian village of [[Horizontina]]. She comes from a large, loving family that she tries to visit as often as she can despite her busy schedule. Originally, Gisele was training to be a professional volleyball player. While in school, Gisele was so thin that her friends used to call her "Olívia Palito" ([[Portuguese]] for [[Olive Oyl]], [[Popeye]]'s skinny girlfriend), and "Saracura" (a Brazilian type of [[shorebird]]). An often told story of Gisele's "discovery" is that she was scouted by a modeling agent at the age fourteen on a school trip to [[São Paulo]] while eating a [[Big Mac]].<br/>+== [[Telectronics]] ==<br/> <br/>-Before that, in [[1993]], a 13-year-old Gisele joined a [[model]] course instructed by Dilson Stein to correct her posture, with her sisters Patrícia and Gabriela, because her mother insisted. The course was designed for teenagers aspiring to become models. In [[1994]], Stein took Gisele and other girls to [[São Paulo]] to give them an opportunity to walk in a big city and to be evaluated by [[Brazilian]] [[Elite]] agents. She was selected by them for a national contest, in wich she came in second. In the world contest, in [[Ibiza]], [[Spain]], Gisele came in fourth.<br/>-<br/>-In [[1996]] Gisele moved to [[New York]] City to begin her modeling career, debuting at [[Fashion Week]]. Since then, she has been the face of a variety of adverstising campaigns including several seasons of [[Dior]], [[Balenciaga]], [[Dolce & Gabbana]], [[Missoni]], [[Versace]], [[Céline]], [[Givenchy]], [[Bulgari]], [[Lanvin]], [[Guerlain]], [[Valentino]], [[Ralph Lauren]], Earl Jean, [[Zara]], [[Chloé]], [[Michael Kors]], and [[Louis Vuitton]]. Gisele is the face of several [[Brazilian]] brands like [[Vivo]], [[Brazil]]'s leading mobile company, [[C&A]], [[Multiplan]], Colcci and Credicard.<br/>-<br/>-With shoes company Grendene she has her own line of sandals, called Ipanema Gisele Bündchen, wich have sold more than 100 million pairs since [[2001]]. [http://www.grendene.com.br/ipanema]<br/>-<br/>-==Career==<br/>-[[Image:LVPhoto.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Gisele as the face of Louis Vuitton. Photo by Mert and Marcus]]<br/>-With her unique beauty and stunning runway presence, Gisele has set the fashion world ablaze like no other model in recent years. After winning the presitigious [[VH1]]/Vogue Model of the Year award in [[1999]], she went on to co-host the ceremony in [[2000]] along with actor [[Cuba Gooding, Jr.]]. [[Vogue]] magazine named her the "model of the millenium" and has referred to her as the "return of the sexy model".<br/>-<br/>-Gisele consistantly works with the industry's most talented photographers, like [[Mario Testino]], [[Steven Meisel]], [[Nick Knight]], Steven Klein, Craig McDean, Michael Thompson, [[Mert and Marcus]], [[Rankin]], Inez and Vinoodth, Alex Cayley, Solve Sundsbo, Regan Cameron, Phil Poynter, Corrine Day, [[Gilles Bensimon]], Paolo Roversi, [[Annie Leibovitz]], [[Karl Lagerfeld]], [[Peter Lindbergh]], [[Mario Sorrenti]] and [[Patrick Demarchelier]], to name a few.<br/>-<br/>-[[Image:ArenaCover2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Gisele on the cover of British Arena magazine. Photo by Nino Muñoz]]<br/>-Gisele has also graced the covers of more than 7,000 magazines from all over the globe like [[Vogue]] ([[United States|American]], [[Italy|Italian]], [[England|British]],[[France|French]], [[Brazil|Brazilian]], [[Japan|Japanese]], [[China|Chinese]], [[Korea|Korean]], [[Russia|Russian]], [[Portugal|Portuguese]], [[Spain|Spanish]]), [[W magazine]], [[Harper's Bazaar]], [[Elle]], [[Allure]], [[Numero]], [[Pop]], [[i-D]], [[The Face]], [[Arena (magazine)]], Citizen K, Flair, [[Rolling Stone]], 10, [[Time magazine]], [[Vanity Fair]], [[Forbes]], [[Newsweek]], [[Esquire]], [[Veja]], [[Caras]], [[GQ]] and [[Marie Claire]].<br/>-<br/>-Not only is Gisele an incredible succesful [[supermodel]], she is also a savv [[businesswoman]]. She is the face, and the brains behind Ipanema Gisele Bündchen, her own brand of women's foot apparel targeting the [[Brazilian]] market and worldwide.<br/>-<br/>-==Controversy==<br/>-Gisele's leap up the supermodel chain hasn't come without controversy, as she is one of several models to defect from her original agency [[Elite]] to [[IMG]]. As with [[Heidi Klum]] and others, [[Elite]] head [[John Casablancas]] has made it seemingly his life's mission to attach Gisele, saying she's a "monster of selfishness" who developed "a pattern of constant thanklessness, pushiness and greed." Casablancas also said Gisele was a [[Stoner_%28cannabis%29|stoner]] who "slept her way to the top" (though he claims he was misquoted, his actions suggest he's full of it). In fact, a recent blind item in the [[New York Post]] saying "Which top model didn't get where she is on looks alone? The increasingly demanding mannequin launched herself by servicing the rakish head of her old agency" seems to uncover perhaps the very reason for his ire. No other model seems to have provoked Casablancas more than Gisele, who fired a $15 million lawsuit against Bundchen. One has to wonder if the source of this feud may in fact lie in the bedroom. <br/>-<br/>-The controversies with Casablancas aside, Gisele has also been brought up in other eye raising events as well, not the least of which are her eye-popping breasts. The Brazilian beauty suggests that her boobs are for real, though Chic Happens referred to them as "the most obvious party tits since [[Tori Spelling]] got jacked-up." We can attest, if they are real, they are the most magnificent pair that man has ever created! Perhaps all this oogling and money has gotten to Gisele's head, as she walked off at a [[Helmut Lang]] show screaming "I don't have time for this sh*t!", reportedly because the designer only gave her one outfit to wear. Top designer [[Roberto Cavalli]] wasn't pleased to see Gisele welch out of a $200,000 payout to do a show for him, when she later demanded $500,000, which brought Cavalli to charge her with extortion.<br/>-<br/>-==Personal life==<br/>-[[Image:GiseDicaprio2.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Gisele and Leonardo DiCaprio arriving at the 77th Annual Academy Awards. Photo by Frank Micelotta.]]<br/>-When she is not working on traveling the world, Gisele enjoys to spend time with her family and friends, and also her dog Vida ("Life", in [[Portuguese]]), a [[Yorkshire terrier]]. She has an on/off relationship with [[Hollywood]] star [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] since [[2000]]. In November of [[2005]] they broke up, but after Leo being photographed at Gisele's birthday party in a [[West Hollywood]] restaurant, on [[July 27]], [[2006]], the news about their return hit the press.<br/>-<br/>-Gisele has also being linked with hotel tycoon [[Vikram Chatwal]], [[Brazilian]] [[billionaire]] João Paulo Diniz, model Scott Barnhill and actors [[Josh Hartnett]] and [[Chris Evans]].

Even though she turned down a role in [[Charlie's Angels (movie)]], it seems only a matter of time before she finds a position more of her liking in front of the motion picture camera. She has said a film career "I think it would be interesting," but counters "I'm young and I like what I do for now and I understand that everything in life happens for the moment."<br/>-<br/>-She made her movie debut in [[2004]] comedy [[Taxi]], with [[Queen Latifah]] and [[Jimmy Fallon]]. After this she received more offers but she choose to concentrate on her enourmously successful career. She also made a appearence on [[2006]] hit comedy [[The Devil Wears Prada]], playing Serena, [[Meryl Streep]]'s assistant's friend.<br/>-<br/>-==Filmography==<br/>-*''[[Taxi]]'' ([[2004]]) as Vanessa<br/>-*''[[The Devil Wears Prada]]'' ([[2006]]) as Serena<br/>-<br/>-==Quotes==<br/>-*"To be a model is to be half actress.

When I get married, I'll live in the countryside, ride on horses and live among cows, chickens and dogs"<br/>-<br/>-*"I think it's better when you're natural, when you just do whatever you want, instead of doing classes where I see all these other people holding back because they've been trained with certain skills or techniques. I'm like, whatever"<br/>-<br/>-*"I'm a very private person. I like staying home and doing my stuff. I hate people invading on my privacy. I hate talking about my private life. You almost feel like they're invading your space, you know? I really hate that. I think that's very disrespectful and I think they should have a law against that"<br/>-<br/>-*"I wouldn't say I'm going to quit modeling and become an actress, especially because I can't do that because I have contracts, but I definitely enjoyed it. I wouldn't call myself an actress, but I at the same time, if there is an opportunity... I believe in taking chances and living your life"<br/>-<br/>-*"I don't think anyone likes to see a picture of themselves in a tabloid, besides a couple people who I'm not going to mention"<br/>-<br/>-==Trivia==<br/>-*Gisele's name is actually pronounced Giseli (The e at the end of her name is not silent). She has said it doesn't matter to her now how people pronounce her name. Her last name is pronounced "Bindchen".<br/>-*''Forbes'' magazine named her the best paid model of all time. Her personal fortune is valued at $150 million and she is in the [[Guinness Book of Records]] as "the world's richest supermodel".<br/>-*Gisele appeared in more than 7,000 magazine covers around the world.

Gisele also serves as the spokesperson and campaign model for Fashion Targets Breast Cancer.<br/>-*Gisele will be the face of a new campaign to protect the Amazon's Xingu River from deforestation and pollution. The campaign is called "Y Ikatu Xingu", wich means "clean and good Xingu water", in the native Kamaiura language. Gisele wants "to tell the world that the Amazon's waters are in danger". The Xingu River extends about 1,700 miles through the southern Amazon, including Brazil's first indian reservation, the 2.8 million-hectare (6.92 million-acre) Xingu National Park. The region was visited by her and ex-boyfriend [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] in 2004.<br/>-*She has five sisters: Raquel, Graziela, Gabriela, Rafaela and Patrícia (who was born in the same day, but is not an identical twin).<br/>-*Speaks Portuguese as her native language, as well as English as her second language.<br/>-*In 2004, she and her boyfriend, [[Leonardo DiCaprio]], visited the "Xingu", one of the biggest Brazilian tribes of Indians.

(13 March 2006)<br/>-*After Gisele carried one bag made by British designer Luella Bartley on the catwalk, all the papers ran pictures of her with it, and this created a phenomenon. The company thought they might sell a few, but suddenly they had waiting-lists everywhere for what was already being called the "Gisele". The success of the Gisele bag propelled Luella into the highly lucrative accessories market.<br/>-*The 2004 TV ad of her line of shoes was shoot on Brazilian famous "Sombodromo", on Rio de Janeiro.<br/>-*In May of 2006, she signed another multi-million dollar deal, this time with american giant [[Apple]].

Loosely speaking, the Fourier transform decomposes a function into a continuous spectrum of the frequencies that comprise that function.<br/>+In mathematical physics, the Fourier transform of a signal <math>x(t)\,</math> can be thought of as that signal in the "[[frequency domain]]."<br/>+This is similar to the basic idea of the various other [[Fourier transform]]s including the [[Fourier series]] of a periodic function.<br/>+(''See also [[fractional Fourier transform]] for a generalization.'')<br/>+<br/>+Suppose <math>x\,</math> is a [[complex number|complex-valued]] [[Lebesgue integration|Lebesgue integrable]] function.

If <math>X(\omega)\,</math> is defined as above, and <math>x\,</math> is sufficiently smooth, then''':'''<br/>+<br/>+:<math> x(t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} X(\omega) e^{ i\omega t}\,d\omega </math><br/>+<br/>+for every real number <math>t\,</math>.<br/>+<br/>+<br/>+The interpretation of <math>X(\omega)\,</math> is aided by expressing it in polar-coordinate form, <math>X(\omega) = A(\omega )e^{i \phi (\omega )} \,</math>, where''':'''<br/>+<br/>+:<math>A(\omega ) = |X(\omega)| \, </math><br/>+:<math>\phi (\omega ) = \angle X(\omega) \, </math><br/>+<br/>+Then the inverse transform can be written''':''' &nbsp; <math> x(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{A(\omega)}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\cdot e^{ i(\omega t +\phi (\omega ))}\,d\omega </math><br/>+<br/>+which is a recombination of all the frequency components of <math>x(t)\,</math>.  Each component is a complex sinusoid of the form <math>e^{ i\omega t}\,</math> whose amplitude is proportional (not equal) to <math>A(\omega)\,</math> and whose initial phase (at t=0) is <math>\phi (\omega )\,</math>.<br/>+<br/>+==Normalization factors and alternative forms==<br/>+<br/>+The factors <math>1\over\sqrt{2\pi}</math> before each integral ensure that there is no net change in amplitude when one transforms from one domain to the other and back.  A necessary and sufficient condition is that the product of the factors be <math>1 \over 2 \pi</math>.  When they are chosen to be equal, the transform is referred to as [[unitary operator|unitary]].  A common non-unitary convention is shown here''':'''<br/>+<br/>+:<math> X(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x(t) e^{- i\omega t}\,dt </math><br/>+<br/>+:<math> x(t) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} X(\omega) e^{ i\omega t}\,d\omega </math><br/>+<br/>+As a rule of thumb, mathematicians generally prefer the unitary transform (for symmetry reasons), engineers commonly use the non-unitary form (as a special case of the bilateral [[Laplace transform]]), and physicists use either convention depending on the application.<br/>+<br/>+Yet another popular form is a transform to / from the domain of [[frequency | ordinary frequency]], <math>f = \frac{\omega}{2\pi}\,</math> [[Hz]]. &nbsp;In that case, the necessary product of the factors is just 1, so a unitary transform is the obvious choice''':'''<br/>+<br/>+:<math> X(f) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x(t) e^{- i 2\pi f t}\,dt </math><br/>+:<math> x(t) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty X(f) e^{i 2\pi f t}\,df </math><br/>+<br/>+This form is commonly used in applications related to [[signal processing]] and communications systems.<br/>+<br/>+And variations of all three forms can be created by conjugating the complex-exponential kernel of both the forward and the reverse transform.  The signs must be opposites.  Other than that, the choice is (again) a matter of convention.<br/>+<br/>+==Generalization==<br/>+There are several ways to define the Fourier transform pair. The "forward" and "inverse" transforms are always defined so that the operation of both transforms in either order on a function will return the original function. In other words, the [[function composition|composition]] of the transform pair is defined to be the [[identity function|identity transformation]]. Using two arbitrary real constants <math>a</math> and <math>b</math>, the most general definition of the forward 1-dimensional Fourier transform is given by:<br/>+<br/>+:<math>X(\omega) = \sqrt{\frac{|b|}{(2 \pi)^{1-a}}} \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}  x(t) e^{-i b \omega t} \, dt </math><br/>+<br/>+and the inverse is given by:<br/>+<br/>+:<math>x(t) = \sqrt{\frac{|b|}{(2 \pi)^{1+a}}} \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}  X(\omega) e^{i b \omega t} \, d\omega </math><br/>+<br/>+Note that the transform definitions are symmetric; they can be reversed by simply changing the signs of ''a'' and ''b''.<br/>+<br/>+The convention adopted in this article is <math>(a,b) = (0,1)</math>. The choice of ''a'' and ''b'' is usually chosen so that it is geared towards the context in which the transform pairs are being used.  The non-unitary convention above is <math>(a,b)=(1,1)</math>.  Another very common definition is <math>(a,b)=(0,2\pi)</math> which is often used in signal processing applications. In this case, the angular frequency <math>\omega</math> becomes ordinary frequency ''f''.  If ''f'' (or &omega;) and ''t'' carry units, then their product must be dimensionless. For example, ''t'' may be in units of time, specifically [[second]]s, and ''f'' (or &omega;) would be in [[hertz]] (or radian/s).<br/>+<br/>+==Properties==<br/>+<br/>+See also the "Table of important Fourier transforms" section below for other properties of the continuous Fourier transform.<br/>+<br/>+=== Completeness ===<br/>+If we define the Fourier transform <math>\mathcal{F}</math> in this way on the set of complex-valued functions on the line with [[compact]] [[support (mathematics)|support]] and [[Continuous linear extension|extend by continuity]] to the [[Hilbert space]] of square-integrable functions, then it is a [[unitary operator]] <br/>+<br/>+:<math> \mathcal{F}:L^2(\mathbb{R})\rightarrow L^2(\mathbb{R}).</math> <br/>+<br/>+Moreover,<br/>+:<math> \mathcal{F}^2 f(x)=f(-x),\quad\mbox{and}\quad\mathcal{F}^*=\mathcal{F}^{-1}=\mathcal{F}^3.</math><br/>+<br/>+Note that in this relation, conjugation refers to the operator only, not to the entire Fourier transform of the function.<br/>+<br/>+===Orthogonality===<br/>+The Fourier transform can also be defined for functions (and distributions) <br/>+<br/>+:<math>f: \, \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{C}.</math><br/>+<br/>+In the definition, the product <math>\omega t</math> is then to be interpreted as the [[inner product]] of the two vectors <math>\omega</math> and <math>t</math>. All the above properties and formulas remain valid.<br/>+In this context, the functions <br/>+<br/>+:<math>\frac{\exp \left(i \omega t \right)}{\sqrt{2 \pi}}</math> <br/>+<br/>+form an [[orthonormal]] basis in the space of tempered distributions  <!-- Removing omega and omega' as they are hard to differentiate, using different letters (alpha & beta) should be easier --><br/>+:<math><br/>+\int_{-\infty}^\infty<br/>+ \left(\frac{e^{i\alpha t}}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\right)<br/>+ \,<br/>+ \left(\frac{e^{-i\beta t}}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\right)<br/>+ \,<br/>+ dt<br/>+=<br/>+\delta(\alpha - \beta).<br/>+</math><br/>+<br/>+The Fourier transform can be thought of as a transformation of coordinate basis in this space.<br/>+<br/>+===The Plancherel theorem and Parseval's theorem===<br/>+If ''f''(''t'') and ''g''(''t'') are square-integrable and ''F''(&omega;) and ''G''(&omega;) are their Fourier transforms, then we have the [[Plancherel theorem]]:<br/>+<br/>+: <math>\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(t) g(t)^* \, dt =  \int_{-\infty}^\infty F(\omega) G(\omega)^* \, d\omega,</math><br/>+<br/>+where the star denotes complex conjugation. Therefore, the Fourier transformation yields an [[Inner product space|isometric]] [[automorphism]] of the [[Hilbert space]] [[Lp space|L<sup>2</sup>('''R''')]].<br/>+<br/>+[[Parseval's theorem]], a special case of the [[Plancherel theorem]], states that<br/>+:<math>\int_{-\infty}^\infty \left| f(t) \right|^2 dt = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \left| F(\omega) \right|^2 d\omega. </math><br/>+This theorem is usually interpreted as asserting the [[unitary operator|unitary]] property of the Fourier transform. See [[Pontryagin duality]] for a general formulation of this concept in the context of locally compact abelian groups.<br/>+<br/>+===Localization property===<br/>+As a rule of thumb: the more concentrated <math>f(t)</math> is, the more spread out is <math>F(\omega)</math>. Therefore a function which equals its Fourier transform strikes a precise balance between being concentrated and being spread out.  It is easy in theory to construct examples of such functions (called self-dual functions) because  the Fourier transform has order 4 (that is, iterating it four times on a function returns the original function). The sum of the four iterated Fourier transforms of any function will be self-dual.   There are also some explicit examples of  self-dual functions, the most important being constant multiples of the function <br/>+<br/>+:<math>f(t) = \exp \left( \frac{-t^2}{2} \right).</math> <br/>+<br/>+This function is related to [[Gaussian distribution]]s, and in fact, is an [[eigenfunction]] of the Fourier transform operators. The Fourier transform also translates between smoothness and decay: if <math>f(t)</math> is several times differentiable, then <math>F(\omega)</math> decays rapidly towards zero for <math>s \to \plusmn \infin</math>.<br/>+<br/>+This can be more quantitatively expressed as follows. Suppose <math>f(t)</math> and <math>F(\omega)</math> are a Fourier transform pair.<br/>+Without loss of generality, we can assume that <math>f(t)</math> is normalized:<br/>+<br/>+:<math>\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(t)f^*(t)\,dt=1.</math><br/>+<br/>+It follows from Parseval's theorem that F(&omega;) is also normalized.<br/>+If we define the [[expectation value]] of a function A(t) as:<br/>+<br/>+:<math>\langle A\rangle \equiv \int_{-\infty}^\infty A(t)f(t)f^*(t)\,dt</math><br/>+<br/>+and the expectation value of a function <math>B(\omega)</math> as:<br/>+<br/>+:<math>\langle B\rangle \equiv \int_{-\infty}^\infty B(\omega)F(\omega)F^*(\omega)\,d\omega</math><br/>+<br/>+and then define the [[variance]] of <math>A(t)</math> as:<br/>+<br/>+:<math>\Delta^2 A\equiv\langle A^2-\langle A\rangle ^2\rangle </math><br/>+<br/>+and similarly for the variance of <math>B(\omega)</math>, then it can be shown that<br/>+<br/>+:<math>\Delta t \Delta \omega \ge \frac{1}{2}.</math><br/>+<br/>+The most famous practical example of this property is found in [[quantum mechanics]]. The momentum and position wave functions are Fourier transform pairs to within a factor of <math>h \over 2 \pi</math> and are normalized to unity. The above expression then becomes a statement of<br/>+the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]].<br/>+<br/>+===Analysis of differential equations===<br/>+Fourier transforms, and the closely related [[Laplace transform]]s are widely used in solving [[differential equations]]. The Fourier transform is compatible with [[derivative|differentiation]] in the following sense: if ''f''(''t'') is a differentiable function with Fourier transform ''F''(&omega;), then the Fourier transform of its derivative is given by ''i''&omega; ''F''(&omega;). This can be used to transform differential equations into algebraic equations. Note that this technique only applies to problems whose domain is the whole set of real numbers. By extending the Fourier transform to functions of several variables (as outlined below), [[partial differential equation]]s with domain '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> can also be translated into algebraic equations.<br/>+<br/>+===Convolution theorem ===<br/>+:''Main article:'' [[Convolution theorem]]<br/>+<br/>+The Fourier transform translates between [[convolution]] and multiplication of functions.<br/>+If <math>f(t)</math> and <math>g(t)</math> are integrable functions with Fourier transforms <math>F(\omega)</math> and <math>G(\omega)</math>, respectively, and if the convolution of <math>f</math> and <math>g</math> exists and is integrable, then the Fourier transform of the convolution is given by the product of the Fourier transforms <math>F(\omega) G(\omega)</math> (possibly multiplied by a constant factor depending on the Fourier normalization convention).<br/>+<br/>+In the current normalization convention, this means that if<br/>+:<math>h(t) = f(t)*g(t) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(\tau)g(t - \tau)\,d\tau</math><br/>+then<br/>+:<math>H(\omega) = \sqrt{2\pi} F(\omega)G(\omega).\,</math><br/>+<br/>+Also, if the product <math>f(t) g(t)</math> is integrable, then the Fourier transform of this product is given by the convolution of <math>F(\omega)</math> and <math>G(\omega)</math>, again with a constant factor.<br/>+<br/>+In the current normalization convention, this means that if<br/>+:<math>h(t) = f(t) g(t)\,</math><br/>+then<br/>+:<math>H(\omega) =  \sqrt{2\pi}  \bigg( F(\omega) * G(\omega)  \bigg) = \sqrt{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^\infty F(\alpha)G(\omega - \alpha)\,d\alpha.</math><br/>+<br/>+=== Cross-correlation theorem ===<br/>+<br/>+In an analogous manner, it can be shown that if <math>h(t)</math> is the [[cross-correlation]] of <math>f(t)</math> and <math>g(t)</math>:<br/>+<br/>+:<math>h(t)=(f\star g)(t) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f^*(\tau)\,g(t+\tau)\,d\tau</math><br/>+<br/>+then the Fourier transform of <math>h(t)</math> is:<br/>+<br/>+:<math>H(\omega) = \sqrt{2\pi}\,F^*(\omega)\,G(\omega)</math><br/>+<br/>+where capital letters are again used to signify the Fourier transform.<br/>+<br/>+===Tempered distributions===<br/>+The most general and natural context for studying the continuous Fourier transform is given by the [[distribution (mathematics)|tempered distributions]]; these include all the integrable functions mentioned above and have the added advantage that the Fourier transform of any tempered distribution is again a tempered distribution and the rule for the inverse of the Fourier transform is universally valid.<br/>+Furthermore, the useful [[Dirac delta function|Dirac delta]] is a tempered distribution but not a function; its Fourier transform is the constant function <math>1/\sqrt{2\pi}</math>.<br/>+Distributions can be differentiated and the above mentioned compatibility of the Fourier transform with differentiation and convolution remains true for tempered distributions.<br/>+<br/>+If a function <math>f: \, \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{C}</math> is [[square-integrable]], that is<br/>+<br/>+: <math>\int_{-\infty}^\infty |f(t)|^2 \, dt < \infty,</math><br/>+<br/>+then it can be viewed as a tempered distribution and hence has a Fourier transform.

An Oxford-educated man in a land of widespread illiteracy, he was a towering persona in Baloch politics for several decades. <br/>-<br/>-After an armed insurgency started in Balochistan in 2004, Bugti was widely perceived as the leader, going underground in 2005.  On August 26, 2006, after several attempts in the preceding months [http://indymedia.us/en/2006/07/17740.shtml 07.07.2006] <br/>-the Pakistan army killed him in an aerial bombardment on his cave in [[Kohlu]], about 150 miles east of [[Quetta]], leading to widespread unrest in the area, where he is widely regarded as a hero and martyr. <br/>-<br/>-With a wide following that crossed tribal lines across <br/>-most ethnic Baloch groups,  the contradictions in this western educated feudal leader roused the strongest emotions, both positive and negative.  <br/>-Despite a violent lifestyle, he had a pacifist image in many groups, and certainly did not espouse a violent path in his early political career.  In recent years, he was accused by the Pakistani government of being a [[warlord]], running a well-organized [[militia]] sometimes considered to be the shadowy [[Balochistan Liberation Army]] (BLA) numbering in the thousands.  The BLA ran dozens of militant guerrilla training camps, and was accused of hundreds of murders, torture and running private prisons and courts.  Hiding in the mountain ranges of [[Dera Bugti]] he was, according to the Pakistani government, directing a “[[Fidel Castro]]/[[Che Guevara]]” style guerrilla war.  In July 2006, it was perceived that Pakistan had targeted him through aerial bombing; <br/>-the leader of Balochistan National Party (Mengal) Sardar Akhtar Mengal said: "The increase in bomb attacks in the Bugti and Marri areas are meant to target Baloch nationalist rebel leader Nawab Akbar Bugti and his associates and called upon of the international community to take note of the situation." [http://www.hinduonnet.com/holnus/003200607101440.htm]<br/>-<br/>-With epithets such as ''The Tiger of Balochistan'', ''The Trade Unionist'' or ''Gas Man'' (supposedly having ownership of many gasfields) he was a towering figure in Baloch world.  The longstanding conflict in Balochistan stems from differences in the perceived autonomy the province was promised when they joined Pakistan in 1947.  Today a large faction is fighting for an independent Baloch nation encompassing areas in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran. BLA, in the opinion of the Pakistani government, remains a "great threat" to law and order in Balochistan and was recently banned by the Government of Pakistan as well as by the [[United Kingdom]], following intense lobbying by Pakistan.{{fact}}<br/>-<br/>-== Life ==<br/>-[[Image:Abba11(a).jpg|250px|right|thumb|Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti (Governor of Balochistan 1973){{unverifiedimage}}]]<br/>-[[Image:Abba14.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti and Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto{{unverifiedimage}}]]<br/>-<br/>-He was the son of [[Nawab Mehrab Khan Bugti]] and a grandson of [[Sir Shahbaz Khan Bugti]]. He was born in [[Barkhan]] on [[July 12]], [[1927]]. A former [[Governor]] and [[Chief Minister]] of [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]]. He was educated at Oxford, England and [[Aitchison College]], Lahore, but he lived by laws more than a thousand years old. Legend has it that he killed his first man when he was only 12, and that he killed another 100 men to avenge the assassination of his son ([[Salal Bugti]]). It was not his values, but his authority and influence over a well-armed tribe of 250,000 people in Pakistan's Balochistan Province that worried the government. It was because he enjoyed absolute loyalty from so many, he "ruled" in Balochistan for many decades "with an iron-fist" and was considered to be a parallel government.<br/>-<br/>-Nawab Akbar Bugti was elected in a by-election to the [[National Assembly of Pakistan]] in May 1958 to fill the vacancy created as a result of the assassination of the incumbent, [[Dr Khan Sahib]] and sat on the government benches as a member of the ruling coalition.<br/>-<br/>-Bugti ([[Republican Party (Pakistan)|Republican]]) served as [[Minister of State]] (Interior) in the government of [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Feroz Khan Noon|Malik Sir Feroz Khan Noon]] ([[Republican Party (Pakistan)|Republican]]) from [[September 20]], [[1958]] to [[October 7]], [[1958]], when the cabinet was dismissed on the declaration of Martial Law by [[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Iskander Mirza]].<br/>-<br/>-He was arrested and convicted by a Military Tribunal in 1960, and subsequently disqualified from holding public office. As a result of his legal battles, he did not contest the 1970 general elections. Instead, he campaigned on behalf of his younger brother, [[Sardar Ahmed Nawaz Bugti]], a candidate of the [[National Awami Party]].<br/>-<br/>-However, Bugti developed differences with the NAP leadership, especially the new Balochistan Governor, [[Mir Ghaus Baksh Bizenjo]]. He informed the Federal Government and [[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] ([[Pakistan Peoples Party]]) about the alleged London Plan, which resulted in the dismissal of the provincial governor as well as the Chief Minister [[Ataullah Mengal|Sardar Ataullah Khan Mengal]] and his cabinet on [[February 14]], [[1973]].<br/>-<br/>-The next day, the Federal Government appointed Bugti as the [[Governors of Balochistan|Governor of Balochistan]], and the [[Pakistan Army]] was deployed in the province as part of a crackdown on the [[National Awami Party]].<br/>-<br/>-He resigned on [[January 1]], [[1974]] after disagreeing with the manner in which the Federal Government was carrying out policies in [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]].<br/>-<br/>-There was a lull in his activities when [[General]] [[Rahimuddin Khan]] was appointed as [[Governor of Balochistan]] in 1978. Bugti remained silent throughout the course of Rahimuddin's rule, which was often characterized by hostility towards the Baloch Sardars.<br/>-<br/>-In 1988, he joined the [[Balochistan National Alliance]] and was elected [[Chief Minister]] on [[February 4]], [[1989]]. His government frequently disagreed with the Federal Government led by the [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Benazir Bhutto]] ([[Pakistan Peoples Party]]).<br/>-<br/>-Bugti resigned on [[August 6]], [[1990]] when the provincial assembly was dissolved by [[Governor of Balochistan]] [[Musa Khan|General Muhammad Musa Khan]] in accordance with the instructions of [[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]] exercising his authority by virtue of Article 58 (2 b) of the Constitution of Pakistan.<br/>-<br/>-The incoming caretaker [[Chief Minister]] [[Mir Humayun Khan Marri]] was his son-in-law.<br/>-<br/>-For the 1990 General Elections, Bugti formed his own political party, the [[Jamhoori Watan Party]] (JWP), being Balochistan's single largest party and was elected to the provincial assembly.<br/>-<br/>-In 1993, he was elected to the [[National Assembly of Pakistan]] representing the [[Jamhoori Watan Party|JWP]] in parliament.<br/>-<br/>-Bugti was involved in failed insurgencies in Balochistan in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. He was at the forefront of a tribal war of independence that is currently being waged in Balochistan. He provided the public face and political support for the insurgency while his grandson [[Brahamdagh Bugti]] leads the Bugti tribesmen.<br/>-<br/>-== In hiding ==<br/>-{{POV-section}}<br/>-[[Image:AkbarBugti.jpg|right|thumb|250px|{{unverifiedimage}}]]<br/>-<br/>-Bugti began an armed insurrection against the present establishment in Pakistan in February 2005, seizing on the rape of a female doctor in Pakistan's Sui gas fields as a political opportunity. In the following months, Bugti's tribesmen launched attacks on infrastructure and military/govt. installations while Bugti threatened the government. Clashes continued until a ceasefire later that year.<br/>-<br/>-While Bugti was well-loved by most Baloch's, many also pointed out his feudal<br/>-background and lamented the lack of development for his region during his stints in power.  However, his courage in standing up against an undemocratic establishment in an environment where most politicians were either bribed or coerced into submission was widely respected.<br/>-<br/>-==Death==<br/>-<br/>-On Saturday [[August 26]], [[2006]], around 2230 hrs ([[Pakistan Standard Time|PST]]), Bugti, along with his grandsons [[Bramdakh Bugti|Bramdakh]] and [[Mir Ali]] were killed in a bombing operation that caused the cave roof to collapse on them. <br/>-His location was traced through the satellite phone he was using and Pakistani secret service agencies pin-pointed his location.(''It is not clear if he was pinpointed through a satellite phone)'' [http://www.dawn.com/2006/08/27/top1.htm] The news of his death was broken to the media by Makhdoom Amin Fahim, leader of Pakistan Peoples Party Parlimentarians. <br/>-<br/>-Pakistani President Gen Pervez Musharraf considers his death a victory on his personal agenda and congratulated the secret service chief who carried out this operation. Pervez Musharraf had previously threatened Bugti. Pakistan's Information Minister Ali Durrani, confirmed that the operation included both air and ground assault. Though, not yet confirmed, but the use of a laser guided missile or Pakistani built "Babur" cruise missle is suspected in the assault, although other reports indicate the involvement of [[helicopter gunships]] and [[air-to-ground missile]]s supplied by the [[USA]]]. [http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/national/1104AP_Pakistan_Tribal_Leader.html]. <br/>-In a short telephonic interview made to a Private TV network, Pakistani Information Minister said that Bugti's death occured as the cave he was in collasped. <br/>-<br/>-On August 24, 2006, under dubious circumstances, some Bugti tribesmen disowned Nawab Bugti.  His property was seized and he was declared as a "proclaimed offender." <br/>-<br/>-Bugti's death was followed by rioting by hundreds of students from the state-run Balochistan university [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/5290194.stm]. As the news flashed across TV screens in Pakistan, the government deployed Rangers and paramilitary forces across major cities to prevent a backlash and impose a curfew in the provincial capital, [[Quetta]][http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/5290194.stm]. Security arrangements for the Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf have been beefed up to the highest level and his movement has since been very restricted, fearing a retaliatory attack. Security arrangements have been further enhanced in and around all airports of Pakistan. The media both in Pakistan and outside have severely condemend the killing as "Military’s second biggest blunder after Bhutto’s execution" and calling it a "political nightmare"[http://www.indianexpress.com/story/11575.html]. Others have likened it to the [[East Bengal]] crisis of [[1971]] where military violence eventually led to the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]].[http://www.ibnlive.com/news/pak-prez-snubbed-by-india-cornered-in-balochistan/19982-2.html]<br/>-<br/>-On 27 August, 2006, some private media broadcasted news that Bugti's grandson Bramdakh and Mir Ali are still alive but no official confirmation has been made.<br/>-<br/>-Bugti's staunch opposition to the Benazir government and Musharraf's dictatorship earned him some serious enemies.  His role in stiff opposition of a military government not only earned him a dubious title of a 'terrorist' but also resulted in creating serious rifts in the Baloch tribe he was leading as the covert state agencies left no stones unturned in undermining his position.   <br/>-<br/>-This is one of the few instances in Asia of a government killing a political leader who had previously served in high official positions&mdash;as a [[cabinet minister]], [[Senator]], and [[Governor]]. His fate could thus be considered reminiscent of that of [[Zulfikar Bhutto]].<br/>-<br/>-==Family==<br/>-[[Jamil Akbar Bugti]], Rehan Akbar Bugti, Salal Akbar Bugti, Saleem Akbar Bugti, [[Talal Akbar Bugti]] and [[Shahzwar Akbar Khan Bugti]] are the sons of Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti.

Therefore, whether Fuzhou dialect is a ''[[dialect]]'' or a ''[[language]]'' is highly disputable.<br/>+A historical town in the state of [[Tamil Nadu]], in southernmost [[India]], '''Vellore''' {{audio|Vellore.ogg|pronunciation}} (வேலூர் in [[Tamil language|Tamil]]) is now the headquarters of [[Vellore district]]. The town lies on the banks of [[Palar River]] on the site of [[Vellore fort]].<br/> <br/>-In [[People's Republic of China]], Fuzhou dialect covers eleven cities and counties in all, viz.: [[Fuzhou]] (福州, BUC: <font face="Charis SIL">Hók-ciŭ</font>), [[Pingnan]] (屏南, BUC: <font face="Charis SIL">Bìng-nàng</font>), [[Gutian]] (古田, BUC: <font face="Charis SIL">Kŭ-chèng</font>), [[Luoyuan]] (羅源, BUC: <font face="Charis SIL">Lò̤-nguòng</font>), [[Minqing]] (閩清, BUC: <font face="Charis SIL">Mìng-chiăng</font>), [[Lianjiang]] (連江, BUC: <font face="Charis SIL">Lièng-gŏng</font>), [[Minhou]] (閩侯, BUC: <font face="Charis SIL">Mìng-âiu</font>), [[Changle]] (長樂, BUC: <font face="Charis SIL">Diòng-lŏ̤h</font>), [[Yongtai]] (永泰, BUC: <font face="Charis SIL">Īng-tái</font>), [[Fuqing]] (福清, BUC: <font face="Charis SIL">Hók-chiăng</font>) and [[Pingtan]] (平潭, BUC: <font face="Charis SIL">Bìng-tàng</font>).<br/>+==History==<br/> <br/>-Fuzhou dialect is also widely spoken in [[Sibu]], [[Malaysia]], which has been called "New Fuzhou" due to the huge amount of immigration there in the 1800s. It has also spread to the [[USA]] as a result of the immigration in the recent decades.<br/>+Vellore has the blend of rich heritage and culture representing the ancient Dravidan civilisation. Vellore had the previlege of being the seat of the Pallava, Chola, Nayak, Maratha, Arcot Nawabs and Bijapur Sultan Kindoms. It was described as the best and the strongest fortress in the Carnatic War in the 17th Century. The [[Vellore Mutiny]] of 1806 was one of the earliest upsurges against the British rule in India.Vellore District  had  always been  on  the  fore - front in the struggle for freedom. In fact the Sepoy Mutiny of 1806 A.D. that  broke out inside the Vellore fort against the British  authority is considered to be a prelude to the Great Revolt of 1857, which is often described by some historians as the first war of Independence.<br/> <br/>-== History and status quo==<br/>-After [[Han China]]'s occupation of [[Minyue]] (閩越, BUC: <font face="Charis SIL">Mìng-uŏk</font>) in [[110 BC]], [[Han people]] began its reign in what is Fujian Province today. Having lost their nationalities, the aboriginal Minyue people, a branch of [[Yue (peoples)|Yue peoples]] (百越, BUC: <font face="Charis SIL">Báik-uŏk</font>), were forced to speak [[Ancient Chinese]] and eventually assimilated into Chinese culture.<br/>+The Monuments found in the district give a vivid picture of the town through the ages.<br/> <br/>-Fuzhou dialect came into being in [[Tang Dynasty]], and has been evolving separately as a branch of Chinese ever since. However, it is also worth noticing that some fragments of the ancient Yue language have been well-preserved for thousands of years. Therefore, Fuzhou dialect is in fact a [[mixed language]] evolving from [[Ancient Chinese]] and the ancient Yue language. Since Fuzhou was open as a [[treaty port]] in [[1842]], some words from [[English language|English]] have also been introduced into Fuzhou dialect.<br/>+The outstanding performance of this district in contributing to the Military service is commendable, as more and more men have enlisted themselves to the Military service, to serve the national indomitable spirit and courage<br/> <br/>-By the end of [[Qing Dynasty]], Fuzhou society had been largely [[Multilingualism#Multilingualism_at_the_societal_level|monolingual]]. After the [[Republic of China]] was established in [[1911]], [[Kuomintang]] began to popularize [[Mandarin Chinese]] in Fuzhou. And after the [[People's Republic of China]] was established in [[1949]], [[Communist Party of China|CPC]] further banned the use of Fuzhou dialect in schools and limited the amount of Fuzhou dialect broadcast on electronic media.<br/>+==CMC Vellore==<br/> <br/>-The [[National language#China|National Language]] movements carried out in Fuzhou by Kuomintang and CPC have been in fact based on the short-sighted principle that Mandarin Chinese and Fuzhou dialect are contradictory rather than complementary. For decades, the extreme [[language policy]] have greatly boosted the number of [[Mandarin Chinese]] speakers in Fuzhou, but have also led to the undesirable result that more and more children and youngsters cannot speak their [[mother tongue]] fluently. Sarcastically, Fuzhou dialect is an [[endangered language]] in Fuzhou downtown areas. CPC has promised to take measures against its decline, but so far nothing concrete has been done however.<br/>+Christian Medical College & Hospitals, Vellore attracts a floating population of 5000 every day, it is because of the world famous Christian Medical College or CMC as it more familiarly known was founded in the early part of the last century by a dedicated American medical Missionary Dr. Ida Scudder.

The main walls are built of massive granite stones surrounded by a broad moat fed with water by subterranean drains from the Suryagunta tank. Within the fort is the similarly aged Jalakanteswara Temple. The fort is one of the most perfect specimens of military architecture in Southern India. One of the interesting features of this Vellore fort is that there is a [[Hindu]] temple, [[Christian]] church and [[Muslim]] [[mosque]] inside the fort. <br/> <br/>-The sample characters are taken from the phonetical book '''''Qīlínbāyīn''''' (《戚林八音》, BUC: <font face="Charis SIL">Chék-lìng-báik-ĭng</font>), a very famous phonology book about Fuzhou dialect written in the [[Qing Dynasty]].<br/>+==Prison==<br/> <br/>-In ''Qīlínbāyīn'', Fuzhou dialect are described as having eight tones, and that's how the book got its name (bāyīn means "eight tones"). Famous though it is, the name is somewhat misleading. In fact, a native speaker can never distinguish between Yīnshǎng (陰上) and Yángshǎng (陽上); therefore, only seven tones exist.<br/>+The central prison in Vellore , set up in  1830 A.D. is  another  Historically important land mark as some eminent personalities and Freedom Fighters like Thiru.

The Schieffelin Leprosy Research and Training Centre (SLRTC) in Karigiri is world famous in its research area.Voorhees College is another famous educational center run by the local diocese. Dr. Radhakrishnan passed from this institution.<br/> <br/>-The rules of [[tonal sandhi]] (連讀變調) in Fuzhou dialect are complicated, compared with those of other Chinese dialects. When two or more than two characters combine into a word, the tonal value of the last character do not change but those of its preceding characters change in most case. For example, "獨", "立" and "日" are characters of Yángrù (陽入) with the same tonal value "5", and are pronounced as [tuʔ<sup>5</sup>], [liʔ<sup>5</sup>] and [niʔ<sup>5</sup>], respectively. When they combine into the word "獨立日" (Independence Day), "獨" changes its tonal value to "21", and "立" changes its to "33", therefore the pronunciation of the word is [tuʔ<sup>21</sup> liʔ<sup>33</sup> niʔ<sup>5</sup>].<br/>+==Accomodation==<br/> <br/>-The two-character tonal sandhi rules are shown in the table below:<br/>+Vellore is surrounded by various historic sites and wonderful wildlife parks.

But for most Fuzhou dialect speakers, those two codas are only distinguishable when in the [[Fuzhou dialect#Tonal Sandhi|tonal sandhi]] or [[Fuzhou dialect#Initial Assimilation|initial assimilation]]. Therefore, most Chinese linguists think that the coda [-k] has already disappeared in modern Fuzhou dialect.<br/>-<br/>-===== Close/Open rimes =====<br/>-In the table above, all the rimes appear in pairs: The one to the left represents a close rime (緊韻), while the other represents an open rime (鬆韻). The close/open rimes are closely related with the tones. The characters with the tones of Yīnpíng (陰平), Shǎngshēng (上聲), Yángpíng (陽平) and Yángrù (陽入) have close rimes while those with the tones of Yīnqù (陰去), Yīnrù (陰入) and Yángqù (陽去) have the open rimes. In connected speech, an open rime shifts to its close counterpart in the [[Fuzhou_dialect#Tonal_sandhi|tonal sandhi]].<br/>-<br/>-For instance, "福" is a Yīnrù character and is pronounced as [houʔ<sup><u>24</u></sup>] and "州" a Yīnpíng character with the pronunciation of [tsiu<sup>55</sup>]. When these two characters combine into the word "福州" (Fuzhou), "福" changes its tonal value from "<u>24</u>" to "21" and, simultaneously, shifts its rime from [-ouʔ] to [-uʔ], so the phrase is pronounced as [huʔ<sup>21</sup> tsiu<sup>55</sup>]. While in the word "中國" [tyŋ<sup>53</sup> kuɔʔ<sup><u>24</u></sup>] (China), "中" is a Yīnpíng character and therefore its close rime never changes in the tonal sandhi.<br/>-<br/>-The phenomenon of close/open rimes is unique to Fuzhou dialect and this feature makes it especially intricate and hardly intelligible even to other [[Min (linguistics)|Min languages]].<br/>-<br/>-=== Vocabulary ===<br/>-<br/>-==== [[Loanword|Loan words]] from [[English language|English]] ====<br/>-The [[First Opium War]], also known as the First Anglo-Chinese War, was ended in [[1842]] with the signing of the [[Treaty of Nanjing]], which forced the [[Qing government]] to open [[Fuzhou]] to all British traders and missionaries. Since then, quite a number of churches and Western-style schools have been established. Consequently, many English words came into Fuzhou dialect, but without fixed written forms in Chinese characters. The most frequently used words are listed below:<br/>-<br/>-* <font face="Charis SIL">'''kŏk'''</font>, [khouʔ<sup>5</sup>], [[noun]], meaning "an article of dress", is from the word "coat";<br/>-* <font face="Charis SIL">'''nă̤h'''</font>, [nɛʔ<sup>5</sup>], noun, meaning "a barrier of meshwork cord or rope strung between two posts to divide a court in half, as in tennis and badminton", is from the word "net";<br/>-* <font face="Charis SIL">'''pèng'''</font>, [pheiŋ<sup>53</sup>], noun, meaning "a liquid mixture used as a decorative or protective coating", is from the word "paint";<br/>-* <font face="Charis SIL">'''pĕng-giāng'''</font>, [pheiŋ<sup>53</sup> ŋiaŋ<sup>33</sup>], noun, meaning "a small sum of money", is from the word "penny";<br/>-* <font face="Charis SIL">'''tă̤h'''</font>, [thɛʔ<sup>5</sup>], noun, meaning "money", is from the word "take";<br/>-* <font face="Charis SIL">'''gă̤-lō̤'''</font>, [kɛ<sup>53</sup> lo<sup>33</sup>], noun, meaning "girl" in a humorous way, is from the word "girl";<br/>-* <font face="Charis SIL">'''sò̤'''</font>, [so<sup>53</sup>], [[verb]], meaning "to shoot (a basket)", is from the word "shoot";<br/>-* <font face="Charis SIL">'''ă-gì'''</font>, [a<sup>55</sup> ki<sup>53</sup>], verb, meaning "to pause", is from the word "again".<br/>-<br/>-=== Other features of Fuzhou dialect grammar ===<br/>-<br/>-== Comparison and contrast between Fuzhou dialect and its related languages ==<br/>-<br/>-=== Fuzhou dialect and [[Mandarin Chinese]] ===<br/>-<br/>-=== Fuzhou dialect and [[Min Nan]] ===<br/>-<br/>-== Writing system ==<br/>-<br/>-=== Chinese characters ===<br/>-[[Image:Chinese Characters.gif|thumb|left|Fuzhou dialect [[Bible]] in Chinese Characters, published by China Bible House in [[1940]].]]<br/>-Most of the characters of Fuzhou dialect stemmed from [[Ancient Chinese]] and can therefore be written in Chinese characters. Many books published in [[Qing Dynasty]] have been written in this traditional way, such as '''''Mǐndūbiéjì''''' (《閩都別記》, BUC: <font face="Charis SIL">Mìng-dŭ-biék-gé</font>) and the [[Bible]] in Fuzhou dialect. However, Chinese characters as the writing system for Fuzhou dialect do have many shortcomings.<br/>-<br/>-Firstly, a great number of characters are so unique to Fuzhou dialect that they can only be written in informal ways. For instance, the character "<font face="Charis SIL">mâ̤</font>", a negative word, hasn't got a unified form. Some people write it as "賣", which is also pronounced as "<font face="Charis SIL">mâ̤</font>" but has a totally irrelevant meaning; some people write it as "袂"; and others prefer to use a newly-created character combining "勿" and "會", but this character is not included in most fonts.<br/>-<br/>-Secondly, Fuzhou dialect has been excluded from school education for many decades. As a result, most of the youngsters and children take for granted that Fuzhou dialect does not have a formal writing system and, when they have to write, they misuse lots of characters with the similar [[Mandarin Chinese]] pronunciation. For example, "會使 (<font face="Charis SIL">â̤ sāi</font>)", meaning "okey", are frequently written as "''*阿塞''" because it is pronounced almost the same way in Mandarin Chinese.<br/>-<br/>-=== Romanized BUC ===<br/>-[[Image:1 Cü Meng.gif|thumb|right|[[Bible]] in Romanized BUC, published by British and Foreign Bible Society in [[1908]].]]<br/>-''Main article: [[Romanized BUC]]''<br/>-<br/>-'''Romanized BUC''', also known as <font face="Charis SIL">'''Bàng-uâ-cê'''</font> (平話字), is a [[romanization]] of Fuzhou dialect invented in the middle of 19th century by some Western missionaries.<br/>-<br/>-This romanization was very popular in the first half of [[20th century]].<br/>-<br/>-== Literary and art forms ==<br/>-<br/>-=== Min Opera ===<br/>-''Main article: [[Min Opera]]''<br/>-<br/>-Min opera (閩劇, BUC: <font face="Charis SIL">'''Mìng-kiŏk'''</font> or 福州戲, BUC: <font face="Charis SIL">'''Hók-ciŭ-hié'''</font>) is a kind of Chinese opera which had been evolving for 300 years and became fixed in the early 20th century.

Also, Version 4.00 is under development, and this version will allow for direct downloading of a user's contributions - copy the source code at the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject edit counters/Java Sandbox|Java Sandbox]] and at [[Wikipedia:WikiProject edit counters/Flcelloguy's Tool|bottom of the Tool's page]] to test out the new version.

Here's what's going on, roughly: There is one instance of the <tt>Namespace()</tt> class per namespace in Wikipedia (they are retrieved using [[User:Interiot|Interiot]]'s [[Special:Export]] method), and each instance is able to store the extended <tt>Contrib()</tt> objects inside of it. As for the Help page, yes. It would be a good idea to make the page at [[Wikipedia:WikiProject edit counters/Flcelloguy's Tool/Help]] with more detailed explanations on how to use the tool and snapshots of the UI (I've uploaded a few). As for the scan - yes, it could be done easily, since you could always retrieve the <tt>Contrib.editSummary</tt> field (which is public), you would just need to browse through the contribs somehow ([[User:AySz88|AySz88]] can help you with maps much more than I can).

How do you feel about getting the opportunity to serve on the ArbCom?<br/>-:::A bit overwhelmed; it's a lot of work, and getting even busier.  But honoured as well.<br/>-   2. What do you think of the election? Do you think they were conducted properly? What could have been improved, in your opinion?<br/>-:::It seemed conducted reasonably well.  I think the purpose of the question page could have been better clarified; too many of the questions were simply thinly disguised attacks (or, in some cases, completely undisguised attacks).  As well, the "winning" criteria might have been more explicit; was it simply percentage, or was it total Support votes, or Support-Oppose votes? Different measures gave radically different rankings.<br/>-   3. What would you say to those who supported you? Opposed you?<br/>-:::I would simply thank those who supported me, and let both supporters and opposers know that I will faithfully carry out my mandate.<br/>-   4. What do you think of the other Wikipedians who were appointed along with you?<br/>-:::They all look like good candidates for the Committee.<br/>-   5. What do you think of Jimbo's decision to re-appoint yourself, Fred Bauder, and Jayjg? What would you say to those who opposed this decision?<br/>-:::I'm Jayjg, I assume you mean James F. :-)  Well, naturally I'm biased, but it seemed reasonable to me.  The Arbitration Committee has, as far as I know, always had appointed members on it, and Jimbo stated that the conditions for eligibility this time were simply getting over 50% of the vote.  All 3 of us are experienced Arbitrators who have proven ourselves, and we all had significant support no matter how you measure it: for example, if you measure by "Support-Oppose", then Fred came in 4th, I came in 7th, and James came in 9th:[http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/arbcom?sort=S-O]  If you measure by Support votes alone, then Fred came in 3rd, and I came in 4th.  <br/>-   6. After a week on the job, what are your initial thoughts?<br/>-:::Most of the new members seem to be enthusiatic and are contributing well; in particular, they have provided new thinking on a number of cases, which is welcome.  The backlog seems to be slowly clearing.<br/>-   7. What do you think are the strengths of the ArbCom? Weaknesses?<br/>-:::I think I answered that when I ran for the office. :-)<br/>-   8. If you could change anything, what would you change? Why?<br/>-:::I would have a process that automatically put arbitrators on the inactive list if they hadn't contributed in a reasonable period of time (say, a month), and would automatically remove them from the Committee if they were inactive for a similar period of time.    This would help ensure that all members are active and contributing, and help keep cases moving through the pipeline.<br/>-   9. What are your thoughts on the clerk's office? Do you support it? Why or why not?<br/>-:::I'm quite concerned about it.  If it were simply an administrative role, which opened and closed cases, tidied up various pages, nagged the Arbitrators, etc., then I'd be all for it.  However, I am not keen on the "summarize the case" aspect of the role which it seems to have taken on (indeed, almost to the exclusion of all other aspects); it seems very much like an arbitrator role at that point.<br/>-  10. Do you plan on finishing your term? If you had to make a choice right now, when your term expires, would you run for re-election? Why or why not?<br/>-:::Yes I plan to finish my term, and I have no idea if I'd run again.  It's a lot of work, and it makes you the target of a fair amount of abuse.<br/>-  11. If there's one thing you could say to the Wikipedia community, what would you say, and why?<br/>-:::Let's work together to build a great encyclopedia!  Why?  Because that is our ultimate purpose here.<br/>-  12. Is there anything else you would like to mention?<br/>-:::Hi Mom! :-)<br/>-:::-- [[User:Jayjg|Jayjg ]]<sup><small><font color="DarkGreen">[[User_talk:Jayjg|(talk)]]</font></small></sup> 16:59, 3 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-==Another interview==<br/>-:'''1. How do you feel about getting the opportunity to serve on the ArbCom?'''<br/>-<br/>-Well, partly "[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|oh, no, not again]]"... ;-) Hm. Both honored and overwhelmed that so many people expressed their support and worried about doing it, as it's a bit of a nerve-wracking job.<br/>-<br/>-:'''2. What do you think of the election? Do you think they were conducted properly? What could have been improved, in your opinion?'''<br/>-I was initially quite skeptical of the idea of open elections, and I'm still not thrilled with it (I refrained from voting, as a candidate), but it did turn out better than I thought it would, despite a few unfortunate incidents. Difficult to propose an alternate system; all have their tradeoffs. <br/>-<br/>-:'''3. What would you say to those who supported you? Opposed you?'''<br/>-To those who supported, thank you for your confidence in me; to all, I'll try not to let you down; please let me know if I screw up. <br/>-<br/>-:'''4. What do you think of the other Wikipedians who were appointed along with you?'''<br/>-All of them are people I have a good deal of respect for (and I'm not just saying that because you're going to print it publicly, either)!<br/>-<br/>-:'''5. What do you think of Jimbo's decision to re-appoint three Arbitrators (JamesF., Jayjg, Fred Bauder)? Do you support this?'''<br/>-Yes, I do; all of them have done good work in the past and I'm glad to see them continue.  (Also, having more "old hands" around is really helpful when so much of the committee is new.)<br/>-<br/>-:'''6. After a week on the job, what are your initial thoughts?'''<br/>-Hm. This directed more to the new class than to me, I guess; my own thoughts now are mostly the same except for "we have ''how'' many cases open?"<br/>-<br/>-:'''7. What do you think are the strengths of the ArbCom? Weaknesses?'''<br/>-I think I've answered this before; my opinion is mostly the same. :-)<br/>-<br/>-:'''8. If you could change anything, what would you change? Why?'''<br/>-Hm. I'm happy to see the committee expanded a bit; there were plenty of qualified people running and I'm glad to see we'll get a wider range of opinions. <br/>-<br/>-I'd like to see the earlier stages of dispute resolution (particularly RfC) worked on some so we don't see as many cases; it's hard to give proper attention to over 20 at once.<br/>-<br/>-:'''9. What are your thoughts on the clerk's office? Do you support it? Why or why not?'''<br/>-I think the idea is worth a shot -- the mechanical work of opening and closing cases, and of doing notifications, is tedious stuff. As for the rest, it may be helpful, it may not; it's worth a try to see what the benefits and drawbacks are. The case summaries I'm not sure of; some of the evidence is all but unreadable, but necessary to slog through anyhow; however, I've seen people working independently do things on Workshop pages that made my job in that much easier and if this happens, then great. I'd rather wait until it's actually been working for a while before offering much of an opinion.<br/>-<br/>-:'''10. Do you plan on finishing your term? If you had to make a choice right now, when your term expires, would you run for re-election? Why or why not?'''<br/>-I do plan on finishing. But three years is an eternity in Wikipedia time (I haven't even been editing that long), and I've seen plenty of others burn out from this. I have no intentions of running for re-election; one term will be more than enough! (Oh, great, of course, now that I've said this, watch me pull a [[Marty Meehan]]. I swear I won't have anyone go back and edit this for me.)<br/>-<br/>-:'''11. If there's one thing you could say to the Wikipedia community, what would you say, and why?'''<br/>-<br/>-Other than "please don't do anything that makes me have to read a case against you"?<br/>-<br/>-No, really. Do the right thing, and use your best judgment. Policies exist to help us do that, not to use as a bludgeon, a straitjacket, or a game. Be nice to people (nicer than you may want to be, even). Assume good faith (which doesn't mean letting bad behavior go unchecked). Use the talk pages. Don't be a dick. Remember that it's possible you're wrong, especially if lots of reasonable people are telling you to consider your actions. If you start feeling like editing is a battle, go do something else; the wiki really won't fall apart.<br/>-<br/>-In other words, please don't do anything that makes me have to read a case against you. (Why? Purely selfish, of course: so I can get back to writing articles and quit reading cases. I suppose there's that whole community project bit too. ;-))<br/>-<br/>-:'''12. Is there anything else you would like to mention?'''<br/>-See above; I've rambled on too much already. :-)<br/>-<br/>---[[User:Mindspillage|Mindspillage]] [[User talk:Mindspillage|(spill yours?)]] 22:00, 3 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-== Proposal ==<br/>-<br/>-I ask you a question. I am currently working on a very massive change to how the dispute resoution is done as well as how Wikipedia functions. I want to make an Appeals board (for use of a better name), that would resolve issues before they go to the Arbitration Committee as well as help enforce there (arbcom's) rulings. Earlier, when I sought to make a higher group it didn't work, but my goal would be reached with either proposal. Now back to the idea: The board would have nine members, three selected by the Arbcom, five selected by the public (users) and one selected by Jimbo. They would each serve six-month terms (I can always change this) and would require a simple majority to make a descision. I feel that I must recieve your advise, because you deal with disputes all the time. So I ask for your comments, good or bad. Thank you for your time.!~<br/>-<br/>-[[User:Wikizach|<font color="red">Wiki</font>]][[WP:EA|<font color="green">e</font>]]Zach 01:21, 4 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-==Open proxy==<br/>-I checked this one with [[User:Submarine]] on IRC, apparently it is behaving as an [[open proxy]].

An identical edit came through from Vietnam, which raised my suspicions, especially as it came from an IP that had been repeatedly warned for vandalism.

In other words, a person (in this case from France) could edit Wikipedia whilst appearing to be in Vietnam, which is against [[Wikipedia:No open proxies]]. Hence the indefinite block.

I personally like where further reading is because it's immediately after the article text itself.  My logic; if you've read this and would like to read more, here you go.  As for the audio samples, it was the same logic; you've just read about the guy, now here's a list of samples in historical order for the article just read.  I modeled this after the [[Marilyn Manson]] featured article, as I liked how the audio section was featured and ordered.  I placed the discography and band afterward because they are lists and, I feel, would be distracting placed earlier in the article.  I don't know if there's a general accepted format on Wikipedia for this, but I personally like how it is set up.<br/>-::As for the band list, originally the article had a LONG band list of every member in the band ever, including studio musicians.  I liked the information but felt an entire list was inappropriate for this article and that a summary of the current band would suffice.  I created a separate article, [[Touring and studio musicians of Phil Collins]], and cut-and-paste that information over.    I had briefly considering deleting the band section and putting it in a "See Also" section at the bottom, but I thought it looked unprofessional with only one link, (That touring link), and nothing else, and I also thought the information was informative in its current format, so I kept the article as is.--[[User:Ataricodfish|Ataricodfish]] 20:10, 12 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-== [[Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Antarctica]] ==<br/>-<br/>-Hi, I've made some changes (well, some other user did actually) regarding the placement of images.

If ninety percent of the population had no interest in aircraft ''other'' than their usage in terrorism, then that article should indeed include such a section; but unlike steganography, that is not the case. Additionally, this section notes that AQ's own training manuals claim that they do use invisible ink, which is closely related and rather interesting.

This "Drphilharmonic" showed up sounding like an academic authority on music, contributing some useful information on the orchestras behind disco (but perhaps wnet a bit overboard with it), and criticizing some of the material in the article as "impertinent". When I ask him to discuss, he then began pitching some longwinded far-out view on the history of disco; but it became clear that he was advocating a particular website. When I and another person responded, these other writers all followed with similar longwinded rambling praising Drphilharmonic and each other, as well as flaming us. I kind of suspect they are all the same person, and the owner of the site discomagic.50megs.com! ("Dr. Rob") Please watch the talk page. I would think everything on the talk page as well as the article should be reverted back to the last version before Drphilharmonic showed up, but some of his info on disco composers was useful.[[User:Eric B|Eric B]] 04:21, 28 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-OK; I just created a new page [[Disco Orchestration]] with Drphilharmonic's orchestra info (which is a whole page in itself, thus too much for the [[Disco]] article), and greatly reduced the info in the "disco" article.

Thanks for your instructive and constructive comment on my recent FAC submission on the Virgin Atlantic [[GlobalFlyer]]. The objections were around a lack of references and citations, to which I responded that this article was the authorative source on the topic, as the information was obtained by me from source. You went on to explain that it should also be verifiable.<br/>-I'd like to continue the discussion really, not in terms of whether or not my featured article application should or should not have succeeded (I accept that it failed) - but more about how to encourge people with first-hand experience - because, at the moment, I don't feel particularly special! :)<br/>-<br/>-Facts are verified at source, by me. I'm not the authority myself, but I did verify them from sources that are not pubicly accessible (one to one face to face, phone or email conversations) and therefore can't be referenced.<br/>-<br/>-In a nutshell, the problem for me is that if I chose to write a book with content in it derived first-hand from the inividuals who are the source of the information, then I could write a Wikipedia article citing the book as an authority. However, seeing as I chose not to do that, but instead to cut out the (old hat) printed page, and to make Wikipedia the authority, the current rules and support framework, doesn't really allow for that.<br/>-<br/>-I would be interested in seeing how we can accommodate and encourage this type of contribution i.e. original research into the Wikipedia.<br/>-[[User:81.171.156.97|81.171.156.97]] 17:28, 28 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-==from Pol-Sci-Prof==<br/>-Dear Flcelloguy,<br/>-As a social scientist, I am interested in the civil reconciliation concerning all that has occurred in [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Disco]].  First, it was uncalled-for and unprofessional for an administrator of Wikipedia to state "off topic flame war and personal advocation deleted."  Married, with 2 children in college now, I am a professional educator in the university system.  I do not know any of the other contributors to the page, and, as I read the comments from the other educators, I interpret supportive elements from entirely different and varied perspectives, which is what an encyclopedia should strive for.  Should we dismiss the contributions from a longtime orchestra conductor who shared a wealth of information from which we all, including you, a cello-player, can learn?  Should we dismiss the contributions from a longtime recording engineer who also shared a wealth of information on the multiple aspects of putting together a music recording during the time?  It is a terrible thing that their contributions were deleted from the talk page; how much just I learned, how much more I would love to know, and how much their presence might elicit from others in the business who could be invaluable resources.  Wikipedia should love to have them as contributors.  From my observation, there is not a reference to non-Wikipedia pages in the text of the "Disco" page; non-Wikipedia pages are suggested only as a resource in the talk page.  I had not known of the pages until their mention, and, if one visits, one will realize that the pages are inactive, archival pages, without even an active e-mail address.  It is highy improper to make the preposterous accusation that just because many individuals have a similar point-of-view and can present them in an eloquent manner, yet substantiate their assertions from entirely different perspectives, no less, they must be the same person.  The one obvious element in the whole discussion is that there are just two individuals - Eric B and KAB - that have chosen to devote great amounts of energy in making mendacious accusations than in becoming more learned; "every person that is against us even if from different backgrounds and different professions and different places in the world is the same person" bespeaks a troubled personality.  A professional organization must neither abide nor entertain this character-type.  Thank you for your time. [[User:Pol-Sci-Prof|Pol-Sci-Prof]] 19:00, 28 February 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-: Our dear friend Rob Mercadante of Massachusetts wrote me a kind reconciliatory email on 6 March 2006. He sent the email under the subject "to Kevin: apologies from "Drphilharmonic" on Wikipedia" and signed himself as being someone from "W. Hartford, Connecticut" who also travels to New Haven and Boston frequently.  The interesting thing is that the email "Drphilharmonic" sent me from Hotmail has an X-Originating-IP that resolves to the library of Amherst College, in central Massachusetts, the same region as his former ISP in Longmeadow, Mass. and his radio show at WTCC-FM in Springfield, Mass.  Therefore he accidentally proved himself once again to be the very same person as Dr. Rob, the host of DISCOmagic.org.  And the first and last name he signed himself as, in his email to me, don't match any professor, encyclopedia writer, symphony conductor, or disco expert that I'm aware of, nor does it match any person in the Faculty Directory at directory.amherst.edu; it's a fictional creation to promote his POV. I, in turn, wrote him a reply in which I wrote such statements as "And you know that I share your interest in symphony-backed disco music." and "Your important contributions to the study of disco merit further discussion and evaluation." I welcome further discussions with him on the condition that he stop pretending to be six people at once, that he stop pretending to have been merely a listener to Dr. Rob's radio show when in fact he was the show's host, and that he stop removing valid song listings and valid comments concerning post-1979 disco, including post-1979 symphonic disco. An important test will be whether he leaves the material I wrote about VERIFIABLE symphonic disco from the 1990s and 2000s at his brilliant essay on [[Disco_orchestration|Disco orchestration]]. It is my hope that he will not engage in further 1970s-centric POV vandalism, so that no arbitration will be necessary. If arbitration becomes necessary, I can supply the IP address Rob emailed me from so that administrators can trace the IPs used to post comments by "Pol-Sci-Prof" and his other aliases to see if they match or at least all come from central Massachusetts. - KAB, 6 March 2006<br/>-<br/>-== [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|Esperanza]] Elections ==<br/>-<br/>-Hello Flcelloguy: Sorry this is a bit late, but thank you very much for your support in the Wikipedia elections.

It seems that articles should use words with the greatest usage to the community at large or something to that effect. I am more interested in rules/procedures rather than banned some guy from using the word outwith if you get my drift.

The articles are still online, so it's easy to check that. What nobody seems to notice is that they were written by Jack Kelley, who in 2004 was fired in a huge scandal (similar to the Jason Blair fiasco in the NYT) because he admitted that he faked most of his stories. There is even an article about him here in Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Kelley). I wrote about it there, with all relevant links : http://www.guillermito2.net/stegano/ideas.html (see very last paragraph called "Is steganography used by terrorists?").

But it is not necessarily true that the near-random distribution  of bits found in modern digital ciphertexts will be harder to detect. Your step 5) can be generalised to "map the hidden message to the covertext in such a way as to minimise changes in its statistical properties". If the LSBs of the image are not as random as a ciphertext -- as is usually the case -- then it is not impossible that encrypting  first will actually ''increase'' detectability. The continued study of steganography of course looks at mapping methods which minimise these changes for various types of input texts, and for some combinations of methods and covertexts it might happen that a very random stegotext is optimal. But probably not for this method.<br/>+:#In general, if you are going to add ECC you need to do them ''after'' encryption. Most encryption methods, and all compression methods of which I am aware, expand errors; so if an error occurs in transmission, the message will decrypt with a lot of junk, decompress with even more (if it decompresses at all) and then there will be too much garbage for the ECC to be able to salvage anything. Of course if you do ECC after encryption that then adds structure to the message which might make steganography harder; but there doesn't seem to be much point doing it the other way. -- [[User:Securiger|Securiger]] 06:17, 2 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+<br/>+== Keyboards that talk IP! ==<br/>+<br/>+Removed bogus "technique".

[[1 January]], 1991.<br/>-<br/>-== Summary of main provisions ==<br/>-<br/>-[Under construction]<br/> <br/> <br/>-== Full English text of the covention ==<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-'''Convention on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition'''<br/>-<br/>-The States signatory to the present Convention, <br/>-<br/>-Considering that the trust, as developed in courts of equity in common law jurisdictions and adopted with some modifications in other jurisdictions, is a unique legal institution,<br/>-<br/>-Desiring to establish common provisions on the law applicable to trusts and to deal with the most important issues concerning the recognition of trusts,<br/>-<br/>-Have resolved to conclude a Convention to this effect, and have agreed upon the following provisions—<br/>-<br/>-'''CHAPTER 1-SCOPE'''<br/>-<br/>-''Article 1''<br/>-<br/>-This Convention specifies the law applicable to trusts and governs their recognition.<br/>-<br/>-''Article 2''<br/>-<br/>-For the purposes of this Convention, the term `trust' refers to the legal relationships created— inter vivos or on death—by a person, the settlor, when assets have been placed under the control of a trustee for the benefit of a beneficiary or for a specified purpose.<br/>-<br/>-A trust has the following characteristics—<br/>-<br/>-a) the assets constitute a separate fund and are not a part of the trustee's own estate;<br/>-<br/>-b) title to the trust assets stands in the name of the trustee or in the name of another person on behalf of the trustee;<br/>-<br/>-c) the trustee has the power and the duty, in respect of which he is accountable, to manage, employ or dispose of the assets in accordance with the terms of the trust and the special duties imposed upon him by law.<br/>-<br/>-The reservation by the settlor of certain rights and powers, and the fact that the trustee may himself have rights as a beneficiary, are not necessarily inconsistent with the existence of a trust.<br/>-<br/>-''Article 3''<br/>-<br/>-The Convention applies only to trusts created voluntarily and evidenced in writing.<br/>-<br/>-''Article 4''<br/>-<br/>-The Convention does not apply to preliminary issues relating to the validity of wills or of other acts by virtue of which assets are transferred to the trustee.<br/>-<br/>-''Article 5''<br/>-<br/>-The Convention does not apply to the extent that the law specified by Chapter II does not provide for trusts or the category of trusts involved.<br/>-<br/>-'''CHAPTER II—APPLICABLE LAW'''<br/>-<br/>-''Article 6''<br/>-<br/>-A trust shall be governed by the law chosen by the settlor.<br/>-<br/>-The choice must be express or be implied in the terms of the instrument creating or the writing evidencing the trust, interpreted, if necessary, in the light of the circumstances of the case.<br/>-<br/>-Where the law chosen under the previous paragraph does not provide for trusts or the category of trust involved, the choice shall not be effective and the law specified in Article 7 shall apply.<br/>-<br/>-''Article 7''<br/>-<br/>-Where no applicable law has been chosen, a trust shall be governed by the law with which it is most closely connected.<br/>-In ascertaining the law with which a trust is most closely connected reference shall be made in particular to—<br/>-<br/>-a) the place of administration of the trust designated by the settlor;<br/>-<br/>-b) the situs of the assets of the trust;<br/>-<br/>-c) the place of residence or business of the trustee;<br/>-<br/>-d) the objects of the trust and the places where they are to be fulfilled.<br/>-<br/>-''Article 8''<br/>-<br/>-The law specified by Article 6 or 7 shall govern the validity of the trust, its construction, its effects, and the administration of the trust.<br/>-<br/>-In particular that law shall govern—<br/>-<br/>-a) the appointment, resignation and removal of trustees, the capacity to act as a trustee, and the devolution of the office of trustee;<br/>-<br/>-b) the rights and duties of trustees among themselves;<br/>-<br/>-c) the right of trustees to delegate in whole or in part the discharge of their duties or the exercise of their powers;<br/>-<br/>-d) the power of trustees to administer or to dispose of trust assets, to create security interests in the trust assets, or to acquire new assets;<br/>-<br/>-e) the powers of investment of trustees;<br/>-<br/>-f) restrictions upon the duration of the trust, and upon the power to accumulate the income of the trust;<br/>-<br/>-g) the relationships between the trustees and the beneficiaries including the personal liability of the trustees to the beneficiaries;<br/>-<br/>-h) the variation or termination of the trust;<br/>-<br/>-i) the distribution of the trust assets;<br/>-<br/>-j) the duty of trustees to account for their administration.<br/>-<br/>-''Article 9''<br/>-<br/>-In applying this Chapter a severable aspect of the trust, particularly matters of administration, may be governed by a different law.<br/>-<br/>-''Article 10''<br/>-<br/>-The law applicable to the validity of the trust shall determine whether that law or the law governing a severable aspect of the trust may be replaced by another law.<br/>-<br/>-'''CHAPTER III—RECOGNITION'''<br/>-<br/>-''Article 11''<br/>-<br/>-A trust created in accordance with the law specified by the preceding Chapter shall be recognized as a trust. Such recognition shall imply, as a minimum, that the trust property constitutes a separate fund, that the trustee may sue and be sued in his capacity as trustee, and that he may appear or act in this capacity before a notary or any person acting in an official capacity.<br/>-<br/>-In so far as the law applicable to the trust requires or provides, such recognition shall imply, in particular—<br/>-<br/>-a) that personal creditors of the trustee shall have no recourse against the trust assets;<br/>-<br/>-b) that the trust assets shall not form part of the trustee's estate upon his insolvency or bankruptcy;<br/>-<br/>-c) that the trust assets shall not form part of the matrimonial property of the trustee or his spouse nor part of the trustee's estate upon his death;<br/>-<br/>-d) that the trust assets may be recovered when the trustee, in breach of trust, has mingled trust assets with his own property or has alienated trust assets. However, the rights and obligations of any third party holder of the assets shall remain subject to the law determined by the choice of law rules of the forum.<br/>-<br/>-''Article 12''<br/>-<br/>-Where the trustee desires to register assets, movable or immovable, or documents of title to them, he shall be entitled, in so far as this is not prohibited by or inconsistent with the law of the State where registration is sought, to do so in his capacity as trustee or in such other way that the existence of the trust is disclosed.<br/>-<br/>-''Article 13''<br/>-<br/>-No State shall be bound to recognize a trust the significant elements of which, except for the choice of the applicable law, the place of administration and the habitual residence of the trustee, are more closely connected with States which do not have the institution of the trust or the category of trust involved.<br/>-<br/>-''Article 14''<br/>-<br/>-The Convention shall not prevent the application of rules of law more favourable to the recognition of trusts.<br/>-<br/>-'''CHAPTER IV—GENERAL CLAUSES'''<br/>-<br/>-''Article 15''<br/>-<br/>-The Convention does not prevent the application of provisions of the law designated by the conflicts rules of the forum, in so far as those provisions cannot be derogated from by voluntary act, relating in particular to the following matters—<br/>-<br/>-a) the protection of minors and incapable parties;<br/>-<br/>-b) the personal and proprietary effects of marriage;<br/>-<br/>-c) succession rights, testate and intestate, especially the indefeasible shares of spouses and relatives;<br/>-<br/>-d) the transfer of title to property and security interests in property;<br/>-<br/>-e) the protection of creditors in matters of insolvency;<br/>-<br/>-f) the protection, in other respects, of third parties acting in good faith.<br/>-<br/>-If recognition of a trust is prevented by application of the preceding paragraph, the court shall try to give effect to the objects of the trust by other means.<br/>-<br/>-''Article 16''<br/>-<br/>-The Convention does not prevent the application of those provisions of the law of the forum which must be applied even to international situations, irrespective of rules of conflict of laws.<br/>-<br/>-If another State has a sufficiently close connection with a case then, in exceptional circumstances, effect may also be given to rules of that State which have the same character as mentioned in the preceding paragraph.<br/>-<br/>-Any Contracting State may, by way of reservation, declare that it will not apply the second paragraph of this Article.<br/>-<br/>-''Article 17''<br/>-<br/>-In the Convention the word 'law' means the rules of law in force in a State other than its rules of conflict of laws.<br/>-<br/>-''Article 18''<br/>-<br/>-The provisions of the Convention may be disregarded when their application would be manifestly incompatible with public policy

which is governed by the law of a Contracting State.<br/>-<br/>-''Article 22''<br/>-<br/>-The Convention applies to trusts regardless of the date on which they were created.<br/>-<br/>-However, a Contracting State may reserve the right not to apply the Convention to trusts created before the date on which, in relation to that State, the Convention enters into force.<br/>-<br/>-''Article 23''<br/>-<br/>-For the purpose of identifying the law applicable under the Convention, where a State comprises several territorial units each of which has its own rules of law in respect of trusts, any reference to the law of that State is to be construed as referring to the law in force in the territorial unit in question.<br/>-<br/>-''Article 24''<br/>-<br/>-A State within which different territorial units have their own rules of law in respect of trusts is not bound to apply the Convention to conflicts solely between the laws of such units.<br/>-<br/>-''Article 25''<br/>-<br/>-The Convention shall not affect any other international instrument containing provisions on matters governed by this Convention to which a Contracting State is, or becomes, a Party.<br/>-<br/>-'''CHAPTER V—FINAL CLAUSES'''<br/>-<br/>-''Article 26''<br/>-<br/>-Any State may, at the time of signature, ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, or at the time of making a declaration in terms of

of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.<br/>-<br/>-The accession shall have effect only as regards the relations between the acceding State and those Contracting States which have not raised an objection to its accession in the twelve months after the receipt of the notification referred to in Article 32.

In [[democracies]] a political campaign often brings to mind elections, that is the choosing of decision makers, but it could also include the effort to alter policy within any [[institution]].<br/>+<br/>+[[Politics]] is as old as humankind and is not limited to democratic or governmental institutions.  Examples of political campaigns are: the effort to execute or banish [[Socrates]] from [[Athens]] in the [[5th century BCE]], the uprising of petty nobility against [[John of England]] in the [[13th century]], or the recent push to remove [[Michael Eisner]] from the helm of [[The Walt Disney Company]].<br/>+<br/>+==Campaign elements==<br/>+[[Image:Hustings20050204_CopyrightKaihsuTai.jpg|thumb|A pre-election [[husting]] at the [[Oxford West and Abingdon]] constituency, England.]]<br/>+<br/>+Any political campaign is made up of three elements.  The modern mnemonic is message, money, and machine.<br/>+<br/>+===Message===<br/>+<br/>+The '''message''' is a concise statement saying why voters should pick a candidate.  Simple examples might include:<br/>+<br/>+*"John Doe's is a business man, not a politician.  His background in finance means he can bring fiscal discipline to state government."<br/>+*"As our society faces a rapid upswing in violent crime and an ever worsening education system, we need leaders who will keep our streets safe and restore accountability to our schools.  John Doe is that leader."<br/>+*"Over the past four years, John Doe has missed over 50 City Council meetings.  How can you lead if you don't show up?  Jane Doe won't turn a blind eye the government."<br/>+<br/>+The message is one of the most important aspects of any political campaign.  The rest of the campaign will focus on repeating that message, so it's important to get it right.  <br/>+<br/>+In a modern political campaign the message must be carefully crafted before it is spread.  Major campaigns will spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on [[opinion polls|polling]] and [[focus group|focus groups]] in order to figure out what message is needed to reach a majority on Election Day.<br/>+<br/>+===Money===<br/>+<br/>+'''Money''' is often called the "mother's milk of politics."  Campaigns have increased in cost over the past few decades and having enough money to pay for the TV ads, direct mail, and staff costs that any campaigns incur requires massive amounts of time and energy.<br/>+<br/>+Fundraising techniques include having the candidate call or meet with large donors, sending direct mail pleas to small donors, and courting interest groups who could end up spending millions on the race if it is significant to their interests.<br/>+<br/>+===Machine===<br/>+<br/>+Finally, '''machine''' represents human capital, the foot soldiers loyal to the cause, the true believers who will carry the word.  The machine may have [[Political campaign staff|paid staff]] or may be completely run by volunteer [[political campaigner|activists]].  Successful campaigns usually require a campaign manager and some staff members who make strategic and tactical decisions while volunteers and interns canvass door-to-door and make phone calls.<br/>+<br/>+Modern campaigns use all three of the above components to create a successful strategy for victory.  No campaign can succeed without attending to all three of them.<br/>+<br/>+==History==<br/>+[[Image:Staggers-truman1948.jpg|thumb|left|President [[Harry S. Truman]] at the mic, left [[Harley Orrin Staggers|Harley O. Staggers]] & [[Alben W. Barkley]]. 1948 in [[Keyser, WV]] on [[Whistle stop train tour|Whistle Stop Train ]]]]<br/>+<br/>+Political campaigns have existed as long as there have been informed citizens to campaign amongst. Often mass campaigns are started by the less privileged or anti-establishment viewpoints (as against more powerful interests whose first resort is [[lobbying]]). The phenomenon of political campaigns are tightly tied to [[special interest group]]s and [[political party|political parties]]. The first 'modern' campaign is thought to be [[William Gladstone]]'s [[Midlothian campaign]] in the 1880s, although there may be earlier recognisably modern examples from the 19th century. <br/>+<br/>+[[Democratic]] societies have regular [[election campaign]]s, but political campaigning can occur on particular issues even in non-democracies so long as freedom of expression is allowed.<br/>+<br/>+==Techniques==<br/>+<br/>+The campaign is established with a particular goal in mind; pass or repeal a law, win an election, or similar.<br/>+<br/>+The focus of the campaign is to reach as many people as possible and persuade them to support the goal of the campaign; and hopefully contribute actively to the campaign itself with time or money.<br/>+<br/>+One of the first priorities for the campaign team (which may be as small as one inspired individual, or a heavily-resourced group of professionals) is to establish the campaign message. This is a brief summary of what the goal is and why the average voter should support it. This draws on techniques from [[advertising]] and [[propaganda]].<br/>+<br/>+The message is then communicated by a number of methods. Possible methods are below. Not all are appropriate for a given campaign.<br/>+*the public media (in US parlance 'free media') may run the story that someone is trying to get elected or to do something about such and such<br/>+*advertising in the media (TV adverts are very common in the USA and banned in the UK; other techniques include newspaper adverts and billboards)<br/>+*holding protests and rallies (if enough people can be persuaded to come)<br/>+*holding mass meetings with speakers<br/>+*writing directly to members of the public (either via a professional marketing firm or, particularly on a small scale, by volunteers)<br/>+*communicating face-to-face with members of the public, either at events, in the street or on the doorstep<br/>+*by cold-calling members of the public over the phone.<br/>+*by distributing leaflets or selling newspapers<br/>+*through websites, online communities, and solicited or unsolicited bulk email<br/>+*through a [[whistlestop]] tour - a series of brief appearances in several small towns<br/>+<br/>+The campaign will typically seek to identify supporters at the same time as getting its message across. These identified supporters are then sent additional information requesting their active support. This can involve 'joining' the campaign, donating money, doing voluntary work, writing letters to the media, voting in a particular way, and generally proselytising for the cause.<br/>+<br/>+The ideal of the campaign is for the numbers of people involved, the media presence, the funds available, the hours worked by volunteers and the number of people reached by the message to increase rapidly and to keep increasing until the goal of the campaign is reached.<br/>+<br/>+Ongoing campaigns can become entrenched as institutions, charities or political parties. Equally existing bodies use campaigns to keep themselves active and relevant.<br/>+<br/>+''See also: [[campaign advertising]]''<br/>+<br/>+==Modern election campaigns in the UK==<br/>+<br/>+===Introduction===<br/>+<br/>+(see also [[Elections in the United Kingdom]])<br/>+<br/>+British election campaigns are very much centered around [[political parties]].<br/>+<br/>+The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]s and the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] aim to contest every seat in mainland Britain, with the exception of the [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]]'s seat (to avoid violating his political neutrality).<br/>+<br/>+[[Plaid Cymru]] contest seats in Wales and the [[Scottish National Party]] and [[Scottish Socialist Party|Scottish Socialists]] contest seats in Scotland.<br/>+<br/>+Each party has a membership and organisation in each parliamentary [[constituency]] and each [[local authority]] (see [[constituency labour party]]). These local branches are responsible for selection of candidates and for campaigning outside of the four to six week period of the [[election]]. The local party organisation is effectively responsible for the local effort in all election campaigns. <br/>+<br/>+This provides a common organisation for candidates of the party at all levels of government, from [[parish council]]s to the [[Westminister]] and [[European Parliament]]s.<br/>+<br/>+===Conduct of election campaigns===<br/>+<br/>+Candidates depend heavily on the national media profile of their party and party leader. The UK has far more national newspapers and TV than, for instance, the United States. Media attention is therefore heavily focused on political activity in and around Parliament and on national figures. <br/>+<br/>+During the campaign parties deploy a great deal of effort in [[news management]], trying to make sure that media coverage focuses on their core messages. The focus on this in the national party headquarters becomes even greater.<br/>+<br/>+In the UK, [[broadcast media]] are explicitly forbidden from taking advertising on [[matters of political or industrial controversy]]. This means that national advertising campaigns are effectively restricted to [[Billboard (advertising)|billboard]]s and [[hoarding]]s. While paid advertisements in newspapers are legal, they are relatively unusual. <br/>+<br/>+While TV advertising is illegal, UK parties are entitled to [[party election broadcast]]s and [[party political broadcast]]s, typically 5 minute pieces produced by the party and shown on the same day on all five principal TV channels.<br/>+<br/>+For Parliamentary elections candidates are entitled to an [[election address]] delivered to the voters by the Post Office. The candidates are responsible for creating the content of the election address, which can take the form of a letter or leaflet.<br/>+<br/>+The campaign 'on the ground' in the election is also of great importance. Parties aim to concentrate resources in their [[marginal seat]]s.<br/>+<br/>+They aim to contact as many voters as possible either face-to-face ([[canvassing]]) or over the telephone, both to introduce candidates and to gain information on the voter's intentions and inclinations. They also produce a variety of newspapers, flyers, newsletters and letters intended to influence voters' opinions.<br/>+<br/>+The campaign culminates on [[polling day]] where the parties launch an effort to [[get out the vote]] by contacting supporters in person, over the phone or by mail. Most voting is conducted in person at a polling station, but there is a right to vote by post at request (in which case ballot papers are issued by mail in advance and returned in advance). There are experiments in progress with 'all-postal' voting and electronic voting.<br/>+<br/>+Ballot papers are typically counted on the night after close of polls. It is an offence to publish an [[exit poll]] while voting is still ongoing. <br/>+<br/>+When ballots for an election have been counted, the [[election agent]]s of candidates are told the provisional result by the [[Returning Officer]] in private. The agents are then able to request a [[recount]] of the ballots before the result is publicly announced.<br/>+<br/>+===Legal restrictions===<br/>+As well as restrictions on TV and radio advertising, expenditure on campaigning is strictly limited. <br/>+<br/>+Any campaign has an [[election expenses]] limit based on the size of the electorate of the ward or constituency in question. A candidate who spends above the limit can be unseated on the ruling of an election court (if elected) as well as facing a significant fine and/or jail term. (In practice this is very rare). <br/>+<br/>+Expenditure by third parties intended to influence the result of the election is counted as an election expense and must be authorised explicitly by the candidate's agent. This too is an extremely rare practice.<br/>+<br/>+There is also a national expenditure limit for spending by the parties. <br/>+<br/>+There is no limit to the size of a donation made to a party or a campaign. However, donations exceeding £200 a year to a party must be recorded and those exceeding £5000 are published. Donations from overseas sources are not acceptable. Donations of over £50 made directly to an election campaign are published.<br/>+<br/>+==Modern election campaigns in the US==<br/>+<br/>+Political campaigns in the United States are not merely a civic ritual and occasion for political debate, but a multi-billion dollar industry, dominated by professional [[political consultant]]s using sophisticated [[campaign management tools]], to an extent far greater than elsewhere in the world. Though the quadrennial [[U.S. presidential election|presidential election]] attracts the most attention, the [[United States]] has a huge number of elected offices and there is wide variation between different states, counties, and municipalities on which offices are elected and under what procedures. Moreover, unlike democratic politics in much of the rest of the world, the US has relatively weak parties, with campaigns being controlled by the individual candidates.<br/>+<br/>+American political campaigns have become heavily reliant on [[broadcast media]] and [[direct mail]] advertising (typically designed and purchased through specialized consultants). Though virtually all campaign media are sometimes used at all levels (even candidates for local office have been known purchase cable TV ads), smaller, lower-budget campaigns are typically more focused on direct mail, low-cost advertising (such as [[lawn sign]]s), and direct [[voter contact]].<br/>+<br/>+Money is raised and spent not only by candidate's campaign, but also by party committees, [[political action committee]]s, and other groups (in the 2004 election cycle, much controversy has focused on a new category of organization, [[527 group]]s). This is sometimes done through [[independent expenditure]]s made in support or opposition of specific candidates but without any candidate's cooperation or approval.<br/>+<br/>+Many political players and commentators agree that American political campaigns are currently undergoing a period of change, due to changing campaign-finance laws, increased use of the [[internet]] (which has become a valuable fundraising tool), and the apparently declining effectiveness of television advertising.<br/>+<br/>+==See also==<br/>+*[[List of democracy and elections-related topics]]<br/>+*[[lawn sign]]<br/>+*[[canvassing]] <br/>+*[[election promise]] <br/>+*[[negative campaigning]] <br/>+*[[get out the vote]]<br/>+*[[attack ad]]<br/>+*[[push poll]] <br/>+*[[opposition research]]<br/>+*[[political campaign staff]]<br/>+<br/>+==External links==<br/>+* [http://www.PoliticalMoneyLine.com/ PoliticalMoneyLine]<br/>+* [http://www.fec.gov The Federal Election Commission] <br/>+* [http://www.theaapc.org The American Association of Political Consultants]<br/>+* [http://www.politics1.com Politics1]<br/>+* [http://www.completecampaigns.com/CampaignGuide.asp CampaignGuide]<br/>+* [http://www.PoliticsOnline.com PoliticsOnline]<br/>+* [http://www.irs.gov/charities/political/index.html IRS: Taxes for Political Organizations]<br/>+* [http://www.lew82.com/ An in-depth look at the campaign of Lewis Lehrman for NY Governor in 1982]<br/>+<br/>+[[Category:Campaigning]]<br/>+<br/>+[[de:Wahlkampf]]</td>

Bush]]''<br/>+In the waning days of the Galactic Republic, when partisan politics and personal agendas plagued the Galactic Senate and halted any attempt at reform, a few senators, such as Bail Organa of Alderaan, stood aside from the corruption.  One such senator was the popular Senator Palpatine of the tranquil planet Naboo, who appeared to be unassuming and unambitious but was in secret Darth Sidious, a Sith Master.  Through secretly ensuring in the Senate (via his political alliances) that a bill that heavily increased the taxation of trade routes used by the Trade Federation--a business that controlled the transportation of traded goods across the galaxy--he was able to, as Darth Sidious, convince the Trade Federation to blockade and then later invade and take over Naboo.  When Naboo's elected Queen managed to flee to Coruscant, Palpatine informed her that the Supreme Chancellor at the time, Valoruum, was personally too weak and surrounded by baseless accusations of corruption to effectively end the crisis on Naboo, with the real power in the Republic belonging to the bureaucrats.  Palpatine convinced Queen Amidila that although Valorum was an honorable man and Naboo's strongest supporter, the only way to oust the Trade Federation from the planet was for the Queen to submit a vote of No Confidence in Chancellor Valorum's leadership and to have a more powerful person fill his position.  Because of his detachment from the corruption in the Senate and the strong sympathy towards Naboo in its time of crisis, Palpatine was nominated and elected as the Supreme Chancellor to succeed Valorum--the last Supreme Chancellor to be elected.  It was through this Sith Lord, having acquired the most powerful position in the galaxy, that the stage would be set for the Galactic Civil War to begin developing thirteen years later.<br/> <br/>-[[Image:Bush daughers.gif|thumb|George and Laura Bush with their daughters Jenna and Barbara, 1990.]]<br/>+Over the next ten years, Chancellor Palpatine's popularity only continued to grow.  In secret, he acquired a new Sith apprentice, one who would require little training and allow Palpatine to focus on his political schemes: a former highly-regarded Jedi Master known as [[Count Dooku]], who then adopted the Sith name of Darth Tyranous.  Around the time that Palpatine rose to the position of Supreme Chancellor, Dooku abandoned the Jedi Order due to his feelings that the Jedi should not be serving an institution as corrupt as the Republic, hoping to eventually teach the Jedi Order a lesson.  He vanished for nearly a decade, during which time he became Darth Sidious's apprentice, before finally re-emerging into public view.  Charismatic, intelligent, powerful, and seemingly trustworthy because of his former status as a highly-regarded Jedi Master of the Jedi Order under the tutelage of Jedi Master Yoda, Dooku was the perfect man to kindle the flames of discontent the galaxy had with the corrupt Republic.  Proposing high plans of restoring peace and justice in the galaxy, Dooku was able to rally thousands of senators and their systems that were indignant with the corrupt Republic to join his cause, all in an alarmingly short time.  Dooku was also able to convince corporate leaders from the commerce guilds and Trade Federation to support his separtist cause, promising a new regime in which free trade and an absolute devotion to capitalism would take center focus in galactic legal policy.  Together, these corporations and thousands of systems formed the Confederacy of Independent Systems.  Palpatine entered into "negotiations" with the Confederacy, but the end result was inevitable: the Separatists and the Republic would enter war.  The Separatists, having a countless number of droid warriors, would certainly have overwhelmed the Republic had not the Senate voted emergency powers to Supreme Chancellor Palpatine.  This enabled him to quickly to create a Grand Army of the Republic using a clone army that the Senate had secretly ordered constructed ten years earlier--an army that the Jedi were unaware until that point, but agreed to work with in what became known as the [[Clone Wars]] between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems.  In the Clone Wars, the Jedi would lead legions of clone warriors into numerous battles against the forces of the Separatists scattered across the galaxy (mostly in the outer rim), yet this three-year war was but a pale predecessor the Galactic Civil War that soon followed it.  During this time, the corrupt Senate was militarily incompetent and unable to effectively wage war against the Separatists, and so it increasingly voted more executive powers to the Supreme Chancellor and allowed him to stay in office well after his elected term ended in hopes of expediting an end to the war.  While most of the Senate and the galaxy on a whole gratefully gave Palpatine this power (especially after the emergence of [[General Grevious]]--Dooku's second-in-command and leader of the Separatist military forces, whose droid-enhanced body allowed him to stand up to even Jedi warriors), some remained wary, including thousands of senators and the entire Jedi Order, save Jedi Knight [[Anakin Skywalker]].<br/> <br/>-The son of former President [[George H. W. Bush]] and his wife [[Barbara Bush]] (nee Pierce), George Walker Bush was born in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] but was raised in [[Midland, Texas]] and [[Houston, Texas]] along with his (abovementioned) younger brothers [[Jeb Bush]], [[Neil Bush]], and [[Marvin Bush]] and his sister [[Dorothy]] (aka "Doro").<br/>+In the final days of the [[Clone Wars]], Count Dooku and General Grevious lead a daring attack on the galactic capital Coruscant and "kidnapped" Palpatine.  Jedi Master and General [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and his former apprentice Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker managed to board General Grevious's ship in the skies of Coruscant, and a confrontation ensued between the two Jedi and Count Dooku in front of where Palpatine was "imprisoned" in a chair.  Although Dooku knocked out Kenobi, Skywalker was able to slice off Dooku's hands.  At Palpatine's urging, Skywalker beheaded the defenseless Dooku, and the two (with Kenobi being carried on Skywalker's back) then commenced in successfully escaping from General Grevious.  The battle was in the end won by the Republic forces, and the Separtists fell back under the orders of its new leader--General Grevious.  Palpatine knew that the Senate would vote to continue the war until General Grevious was brought to justice, and used this time to further increase his executive powers and corrupt, through psychological manipulation, his newest prospective apprentice: Anakin Skywalker.<br/> <br/>-After graduating from the [[Phillips Academy]] in [[June]] [[1964]], Bush attended [[Yale University]], where he graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[History]] in 1968. In May 1968 he joined the Texas Air National Guard; questions about his service during this period would end up dogging him throughout the [[U.S. Presidential Election, 2004]]. In 1973 he obtained permission to end his six-year obligation six months early, and left to attend [[Harvard Business School]], where he received his [[Masters of Business Administration]] in 1975. Two years later, he married [[Laura Bush|Laura Welch]], a Democrat librarian originally from Midland. They have twin daughters, Barbara and Jenna, born in 1981. George W. Bush is the only President in history to be the father of twins.<br/>+The Jedi Order and senators opposing Palpatine knew that the end of the war was near, but remained skeptical that the Supreme Chancellor would willingly reliquinish his executive powers.  Senators Bail Organa, Padme Amidala, Fang Zhar, Mon Mothma, Garm Bel Iblis, and approximately 2,000 other senators signed a petition (known as the Delegation of 2000) requesting the limitation of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine's executive powers. Palpatine promptly dismissed the committee of senators, citing this of further evidence of the Galactic Senate's inefficient attempts to prosecute the war and assuring the galaxy that he would "do what is right."  The Jedi Order took a more direct approach in their attempts to break the Supreme Chancellor's dictatorial emergency powers: General Kenobi was selected to lead a mission to eliminate the Seperatist leader General Grievous, which would thus prompt the Senate to end the Clone Wars and leave Palpatine with no excuse to maintain his executive powers or even his position as Supreme Chancellor.<br/> <br/>-After graduating from Yale University, Bush joined the Texas [[Air National Guard]] on [[May 27]], [[1968]], during the [[Vietnam War]], with a commitment to serve until [[May 26]], [[1974]]. He was promoted to [[first lieutenant]] on the November 1970 recommendation of Texas Air National Guard commander Lt. Col. [[Jerry B. Killian]]. He served as an [[F-102]] pilot until 1972.<br/>+Unfortunately, the hope that the end the war would bring about the removal of Palpatine from office deteriorated during General Kenobi's mission when Skywalker, one of the Republic's greatest heroes and Jedi Knights, informed Master [[Mace Windu]] of the Jedi Council that he had discovered that Palpatine revealed himself (to Skywalker alone) as Sith Lord. Hastily, Master Windu and a team of Jedi Masters attempted to arrest the Supreme Chancellor. The Sith Lord then revealed himself in all his fury, quickly eliminating all the Jedi Masters, and allowing Windu to survive for the sole purpose of being the catalyst to Skywalker's fall to the dark side. Psychologically manipulated by Palpatine and ulitimately unwillingy to allow his death, Skywalker disarmed Windu after the Jedi Master threatened to kill the Chancellor, and Palpatine commenced in killing Windu himself, the second most powerufl Jedi in the galaxy.<br/> <br/>-[[Image:GW-Bush-in-uniform.jpg|thumb|left|George W. Bush in his National Guard uniform.]]<br/>+Immediatly after this attack on his life by the Jedi Order, Palpatine unleashed [[Order 66]].  Through this order, he effectively eliminated the entire Jedi Order except for what few Jedi who were able to survive, primarily (perhaps solely) Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi. Clone Troopers opened fire upon their Jedi generals, and Anakin Skywalker, now known as [[Darth Vader]], eliminated all opposition in the Jedi Temple. It was here where Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan percieved the true, insidious nature of this "Great Jedi Purge" as he was almost gunned down by Clone Troopers of the 501st Legion simply because he screamed "no!" in response to seeing the Clone Troopers kill a child Jedi outside the Jedi Temple. However, in a sweeping move, Palpatine revealed the Jedi Rebellion as a sinister coup d'etat, appearing with all of his new deformities as a result of his encounter with Mace Windu. The Galactic Senate, in sympathy with Palpatine, and in moral outrage, elected Palpatine Emperor for life, and aided in the reformation of the Republic into the [[Galactic Empire]]. Subsequently, the senators who protested to this reformation were arrested. Their fates are unknown to history. This prompted many of the senators outraged with this [[New Order]], including Bail Organa and Mon Mothma, to hold their tongues on the Senate floor and save their energy for an eventual military revolution (the Galactic Civil War), which then seemed to be the only method to end Palpatine's rule.<br/> <br/>-It has been frequently alleged that Bush skipped over a waiting list to receive a National Guard slot, that he did not report for required duty from 1972 to 1973, and that he was suspended from flying after he failed to take a required physical examination and drug test. These issues were publicized during the 2004 Presidential campaign by the group [[Texans for Truth]] and other Bush critics. Supporters of the president point out that all known documentary evidence regarding Bush's service in the Texas Air National Guard, to include pay records and an honorable discharge, indicate Bush served honorably. See [[George W. Bush military service controversy]] for details.<br/>+The newly crowned Emperor Palpatine continued to use the "Jedi Rebellion" and the hostilities of former Confederate planets as excuses to expand the Empire's already inflated military forces. The Republic's veteran Clone Troopers were progressively replaced with trained recruits who became the Imperial Stormtoopers, and they along with Imperial Star Destroyers and TIE Fighters began enforcing the Empire's edicts throughout the galaxy (a job once held by the noble Jedi). The grandest of the Empire's military projects, and debatably the focus of the Galactic Civil War itself, was the construction of the Death Star. This armored world-destroying planetoid was no less than the manifestation of the Emperor's will. Though these events seemed originally to be merely the product of humanity's ruthless lust for power, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the overthrow of the Republic and the extermination of the Jedi has been a plan nearly 1,000 years in the making. The Empire that ruled the galaxy was actually the realization of a Sith Empire, conquered from within, and ruled by a theocratic Dark Side dictatorship.<br/> <br/>-On [[September 4]], [[1976]], Bush was pulled over by police near his family's summer home in [[Kennebunkport, Maine]]. He was arrested for [[Drunk driving (United States)|driving under the influence]], admitted his guilt in the incident, was fined $150, and had his driving license suspended for 30 days within the state. [http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/11/02/bush.dui] [http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/bushdui1.html]<br/>-News of the arrest was uncovered by the press five days before the 2000 presidential election. Bush has described his days before his religious conversion in his 40s as his "nomadic" period and "irresponsible youth" and admitted to drinking "too much" in those years. He says that he gave up drinking for good shortly after waking up with a hangover after his 40th birthday celebration: "I quit drinking in 1986 and haven't had a drop since then." He ascribed the change in part to a 1985 meeting with Reverend [[Billy Graham]].

These and other fierce commanders would become the face of the Empire, yet in the end everyone in the Empire either reported directly to the Emperor himself or indirectly to him through Darth Vader.  Those who rose in rank to the highest positions in the Empire demonstrated absolute loyalty to the Emperor and dedication to the principles of the New Order.  Tarkin especially was zealous in his "intellectual" defense of the Empire. In the ''Expanded Universe'', Tarkin was a ship commander who bore witness to a peaceful anti-tax demonstration. In response, Takin landed his ship atop of the protestors, killing some 200 Ghormese. In response to what would later be known as the Ghormese Masacre, Palpatine promoted Takin became one of the Empire's first Moffs, and later Grand Moffs. Tarkin's philosophy, later to be adopted by the Imperial Starfleet and Army, became known as the "Tarkin Doctrine." The essential thesis was that the Empire should rule through "fear of force" -an obvious insinuation to the Death Star- as opposed to force itself.  <br/> <br/>-Bush has said that he did not use illegal drugs at any time since 1974. [http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/08/19/president.2000/bush.drug]<br/>-He has denied the allegation (Hatfield 1999) that family influence was used to expunge the record of an arrest for [[cocaine]] possession in 1972, but has refused to discuss whether he used drugs before 1974. [http://www.mapinc.org/drugnews/v99/n1143/a08.html?4588]<br/>-In taped recordings of a conversation with an old friend, author [[Doug Wead]], Bush said: &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t answer the marijuana question. You know why? Because I don&#8217;t want some little kid doing what I tried.&#8221; When Wead reminded Bush that the latter had publicly denied using cocaine, Bush replied, "I haven't denied anything." [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4282799.stm] [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6999665]<br/>+The Empire soon controlled the galaxy with an iron fist, with the overbearing military brutality upholding tyranical galactic laws (the huge military effectively replaced the noble Jedi in enforcing the law). Using individuals like Tarkin, Palpatine expanded upon a trend already present at the end of the Clone Wars, to select his own military governors who were "unofficially" above the authority of the Senate (in theory, they reported to the Senate; in practice, they reported directly to the Emperor).<br/> <br/>-'''See also [[George W.

This decision reflected Bush's conversion experience during these years, prompting him to move towards a faith community that embraced a more conservative religious belief system.<br/>+==Onset of the Rebellion==<br/> <br/>-Currently Bush is known for his private daily morning Bible study periods, and for the Thursday lunch Bible study meetings which he sponsors at the White House. While he invariably shies away from directly discussing the particulars of his faith, he is known to generally advocate conservative Christian religious values. <br/>+Though Padme Amidala had died at the dusk of the Clone Wars, Bail Organa, Garm Bel Iblis, and Mon Mothma were slowly, politically and militarily, preparing for yet another war. It is a measure to the strength of Palpatine's empire that it required almost eighteen years to adequately prepare for the upcoming war. (Though never mentioned in the movies, in the Expanded Universe Bail Organa, the Viceroy of Alderaan, acted as mediator between the politically savvy Mon Mothma of Chandrilla and the belicose Garm Bel Iblis of Corellia.) Together, they formed the Rebel Alliance against the Empire. <br/>+Politically, this freedom fighting organization had some of the most brilliant and dedicated leaders in the galaxy.  Militarily, however, the Rebel Alliance was completely disorganized, chatoic, and very weak. It is known initially that their largest front-line capital ships were old Dreadnaught cruisers, barely one-third the strength of a single Imperator class Star Destroyer. Their armies were little better: poorly armed and trained guerillas from oppressed planets mixed with high strung intellectuals and political idealists who simply hated the Empire.  The Imperial Army, and specifically the Imperial Stormtroopers, were generally more mechanized, better equipped, and more experienced than their irregular Rebel counterpart (any doubts of this can be redirected to the opening combat scenes of [[A New Hope]]). Experience in fighting numerically superior droid opponents in the Clone Wars made the Imperial Army nearly invincible in the open field, and it was only after the Battle of Endor that the Rebel Alliance could successfully supplant the Army in that medium. The Army, with is AT-ST's and AT-AT's, could single handedly win entire battles with most of the Alliance's weaponry simply bouncing off the armor. Generally, the army could rely upon the overwhelming orbital firepower of the Imperial Starfleet, but this was not essential in the Order of Battle (as seen in the Battle of Hoth). The Rebel Alliance tended to shy away from fielding armies because of this.  The prevailing military minds of the Rebel Alliance proposed a strategy of guerilla strikes upon the Empire with de-centralized cell and fighter groups acting independently, while still mainting a hidden main base of operations withcentral command headquaters.  The Alliance groundforces at the outset of the Galactic Civil War were generally regulated to three tasks:<br/>+1. Fielding a sizeable army to defend the command headquarters (relocated planet to planet).<br/>+2. Brokering equippment, training, leadership, and unity to local resistance units.<br/>+3. Engaging small guerilla and commando teams for specific mission profiles such as search and destroy, sabotage, inciting local partisans, abduction and/or rescue sorties, or assassination.<br/> <br/>-The BBC released a documentary called ''Israel and the Arabs: Elusive Peace'' in which it was claimed that Palestinian leader [[Mahmoud Abbas]] said that during a meeting with President Bush, Bush stated that God told him to invade Afghanistan and Iraq as well as to establish a Palestinian state. [http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/bush-said-god-told-him-to-invade-report/2005/10/07/1128562970098.html] White House spokesman [[Scott McClellan]] has denied that the President ever made such statements, saying, "That's absurd. He's never made such comments".

[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4320586.stm] The claim was also denied by Palestinian leader [[Mahmoud Abbas]], who reportedly heard the claim. [http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/abbas-denies-bushs-mission-from-god-remark/2005/10/08/1128563027485.html]<br/>+The Imperial Army and Imperial Navy enjoyed a significant advantage over its opponents throughout most of the war, especially at its onset.  The Rebel Alliance very unsuccessful in its early years, but by one year before the [[Battle of Yavin]] (0 [[BBY]]), it was clear the war was in full swing. Designers from the Incom Corporation defected to the Rebel Alliance to supply them with the new T-65 X-wing starfighter. The seeming triviality of this innovation cannot be overstated, and it provided the Alliance with the nucleus of its armed might. The Imperial Starfleet, despite its seeming invicibility, had an uncomplicated view of warfare. The Star Destroyers and other heavily armed capital ships would close ranks with the enemy's fleet, and decimate them. The infamous TIE Fighters and TIE Bombers were restricted to the range of each individual capital ship, and thus were without exception the junior arm. The X-wing had many times the firepower, durability, and armor of a TIE Fighter, plus it boasted a shields and hyperdrive technology. This was infinitely important as shields would almost always provide the edge between comparable Imperial pilots. The defenses of the X-wing thus protected Alliance pilots long enough to gain veteran experience. The hyperdrive, however, was the true edge as it allowed independent units to harrass the Imperial Starfleet on their own accord. These hit and run campaigns formed the heart of the early Alliance military. Despite these great advantages, the Alliance suffered terribly: the veteran Imperial Starfleet and Army, victor of the Clone Wars and dozens of smaller conflicts, would continously defeat the Alliance in open battle.  Even missions when regular Alliance military were utilized, they tended to be used in an irregular fashion. The Alliance's significant advantage over the Imperial Army, however, lay in its excellent snub-fighters, which could quickly achieve aerial superiority over the TIE class fighters. Thus the strategy of pairing small ground forces with snub-fighters enabled the Alliance to score many victories over their Imperial opponents.<br/> <br/>-==Business and early political career==<br/>-<!-- <br/>-Anyone who vandalizes the page may be blocked for 24 hours or more without further warning. --><br/>-In 1978, Bush ran for the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] but lost to a [[Texas Legislature|State Senator]], Democrat [[Kent Hance]] (who has since become a Republican). [[Ronald Reagan]], at the time a former Governor of [[California]], endorsed Bush's opponent in the Republican [[primary election]].  <br/>- <br/>-Bush began his career in the oil industry in 1979, when he established [[Arbusto Energy]], an oil and gas exploration company he formed with leftover funds from his education trust fund and money from other investors. The [[1979 energy crisis]] hurt Arbusto and, after a name change to Bush Exploration Co., Bush sold the company in 1984 to [[Spectrum 7]], another Texas oil and gas exploration firm. Under the terms of the sale, Spectrum 7 made Bush its CEO (Chief Executive Officer). Spectrum 7 lost revenue and was merged into [[Harken Energy]] Corporation in 1986, with Bush becoming a director of Harken.<br/>+Despite the fact that the majority of the Alliance leaders were human, the contributions of thousands oppressed races made victory possible. It is doubtful that the Emperor personally harbored xenophobia (this would be contradicted given the status of Darth Maul, etc.), but many fans of Star Wars believe that the Imperial culture at large distrusted and many times abused and enslaved non-human cultures--and with good reason to suspect this. The Wookies, for example, were immediately enslaved following Order 66. However, in this action the Empire inadvertantly created some of the Alliance's fiercest warriors, symbolized by the Wookie-Smuggler Chewbacca. Another of the Empire's former allies-turned-enemies were the Mon Calamarians, incited following a Star Destroyer destroying several of their aquatic cities. Before the Mon Calamarian defection, the Alliance battle fleet consisted of ships such as the Dreadnaughts (obsolete nearly two decades before), fast, but poorly armed Corellian Corvettes, ancient Bulk Cruisers, captured Imperial ships such as Nebulon-B Frigates and Loronar Strike Cruisers, and assorted collections of antiquated snub-fighters such as the Z-95 and Y-Wings, as well as the sparse collections of the new but few X-Wings. The Mon Calamarians quickly turned their luxury ocean liners into instruments of war. The Mon Calamarian cruisers engraved the Alliance into military history as galactic warfare shifted: although these 1,200 meter warships could never match the firepower of their Imperial counter parts, the massive amounts of high quality star fighters they carried in their berths greatly made up for these disavantages. Imperial gunners, accustomed in exchanging massive broadsides with other capital ships, were unable to provide an effective response for these fast moving attacks. Of course, perhaps the most decisive (yet improbable) alliance of all came upon a small, obscure moon on the outer-rim. In the final battle in which every scene was decisive was seen a primitive peasant folk rise up and become warriors for the most decisive battle in history. <br/> <br/>-After working on his father's successful [[U.S. presidential election, 1988|1988 presidential campaign]], he was told by a friend, [[William DeWitt, Jr.]], that another family friend, [[Eddie Chiles]], wanted to sell the Texas Rangers, his [[Arlington, Texas|Arlington]]-based [[Major League Baseball]] franchise. In April 1989, Bush assembled a group of investors from his father's close friends (including fellow fraternity brother [[Roland W. Betts]]); the group bought 86% of the Rangers for $75,000,000 (USD). (Bush later appointed one of these partners, [[Tom Schieffer]], to the post of Ambassador to [[Australia]].) Bush received a 2 % share by investing $606,302 (USD), of which $500,000 (USD) was a bank loan. Bush paid off the loan by selling $848,000 (USD) worth of stock in Harken Energy in 1990. As Harken Energy reported significant financial losses within a year of this sale (as did much of the energy industry due to the recession of the early 1990s), the fact that Bush was advised by his own counsel not to sell his shares later fueled allegations of insider trading. (see<br/>-[[George_W._Bush_insider_trading_allegations|George W. Bush insider trading allegations]] for more information) <br/>-The federal [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) concluded on [[March 27]], [[1992]], by Assistant Director of the SEC, Herb Janick, that Bush had a "preexisting plan" to sell the Harken stock and that Bush had a "relatively limited role in Harken management", and that they did not believe insider trading took place.

Both Alderaan and Chandrila had a deep-seated history in opposing Palpatine's federalization even during his premiership. Yet it would be Alderaan that would become the symbol of the Rebellion, at first for its inherent culture and civility, and later for its tragic fate. Corellia was also an early opponent, initially opting for neutrality during the Clone Wars until fate dealt its heavy hand. Corellians were characterized as free spirited and hasty to react, and this made them ideal warriors and especially pilots. Due to the Empire's massive intergalactic tarriffs crippling the mercantile industries, and the traditional autonomy of the planet itself, the Corellians felt especially alienated. Therefore, the Alliance recieved huge quantities of fast, lightly armed capital ships made ideal platforms for raids and limited combat. Garm Bel Iblis, the great Corellian warrior, would lead the Corellians. Other great warheroes included Crix Madine, Jan Dodanna of the ancient warrior clan, Wedge Antilles, and Han Solo.<br/> <br/>-Bush served as managing general partner of the Rangers for five years. He was active in the team's media relations and in securing the construction of a new stadium, which opened in 1994 as [[Ameriquest Field in Arlington|The Ballpark in Arlington]].

The Rebel Alliance gave Palpatine a means to further tighten his power, allowing him to disband the Imperial Senate entirely and give regional governors direct military control over their terrorities in the name of galatic safety and security from the "treasounous and aggressive" Rebel Alliance.  It also served Palpatine as a stage to debut his newest potential servant: Luke Skywalker. After the Battle of Yavin, Luke Skywalker's name rang throughout the galaxy as the hero who destroyed the Death Star, and it did not take long for the Emperor and his apprentice to identify this young X-wing pilot.  He immediatly sparked their interest, for he played a pivotal part in the war that went far beyond just destroying the Death Star: Darth Vader, born as [[Anakin Skywalker]]--the father of Luke Skywalker--was the prophesized "Chosen One" from Jedi lore, concieved of midichlorians themselves and having a midichlorian count greater than any known Jedi in galactic history.  With sufficient training, this allowed Darth Vader to become the galaxy's most powerful Force-user in known galactic history--and he was (reluctantly at times) controlled, through psychological manipulation, by Emperor Palpatine. Luke Skywalker, being the son of Anakin, would have much of Vader's inherit power over the Force, and since he was an agent of the Rebel Alliance and a Jedi in training, he posed a significant threat to the survival of the Sith Lords in command of the Empire. Thus, Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader both sought to turn Luke Skywalker to the dark side, and used the war to help achieve their means through acts including imprisoning and torturing Luke's closest friends (who were also widely-known war heroes).  Despite the titanic struggle that drew battle lines across the galaxy, the entire war was little more than a backdrop for the conflict of a slave against his master, and the story of a son's unconditional love for his father. <br/> <br/>-In 1994, Bush took a leave of absence from the Rangers to run for [[Governor of Texas]] against the popular [[incumbent]], Democrat [[Ann Richards]]. On [[November 8]], [[1994]], he defeated Richards, 53% to 46%. As Governor, Bush forged a legislative alliance with powerful Texas Lt. Governor [[Bob Bullock]], a longtime Democrat. In 1998 Bush went on to win re-election in a [[landslide victory]] with close to 69% of the vote, becoming the first Texas governor to be elected for two consecutive four-year terms. [http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1998/11/03/election/governors/texas] (Until 1975, Texas governors served two-year terms.) During Bush's terms as Governor, he undertook significant legislative changes in the areas of criminal justice, [[tort]] law, and school financing. Bush took a hard line on capital punishment, and received much criticism from advocates wanting to abolish the [[death penalty]]. Under Bush, Texas' incarceration rate was 1014 inmates per 100,000 state population in 1999, the second highest in the world (Louisiana was first at 1025 inmates), due mainly to the strict illegal drug laws enforcement in Texas. One of his accomplishments was the [[Texas Futile Care Law]]. Bush's transformative agenda, in combination with his political and family pedigree, catapulted him onto the national political radar. As the campaign to succeed [[Bill Clinton]] as president began in earnest, Bush emerged as a key figure.<br/>+==Destruction of the Empire==<br/> <br/>-==Presidential campaigns==<br/>-<!-- <br/>-Anyone who vandalizes the page may be blocked for 24 hours or more without further warning. --><br/>+Three years after the Battle of Yavin, The Empire counter-attacked by locating (through a probe droid) and destroying the Rebel's main base on Hoth in what was known as the Battle of Hoth.  The Empire also began construction on a second, more-powerful Death Star.  Still in its construction stages, yet having its weapons operational and being protected by an energy field generated from the moon it was orbiting (called Endor), this second Death Star was attacked by the Rebel Alliance in the [[Battle of Endor]] (4 ABY).  Emperor Palpatine was well aware of the attack before it occurred, knowingly allowing the Rebels to obtain information on the location of the shield generator, which was supposed to be destroyed by a covert Rebel force prior to the attack.  The Rebel force was taken into custody, but thanks to befriending Endor's native Ewoks beforehand, were able to complete their mission in the midst of a large battle between the Ewoks and the Empire's ground forces.  This allowed the Rebel fleet to destroy the Death Star and much of the Star Destroyer fleet that protected it.  The Battle of Endor also resulted in the deaths of Palpatine and his right-hand man, [[Darth Vader]] who, as [[Anakin Skywalker]], had returned from the dark side and sacrificed his life to save his son, [[Luke Skywalker|Luke]]. In this battle, the Empire suffered its most grievous defeat, allowing the Rebel Alliance to form a [[New Republic (Star Wars)|New Republic]] that would correct the problems of the Old, and for Luke Skywalker to form a new [[Jedi Order]], ushering in a new era of peace throughout the galaxy.<br/> <br/>-[[Image:Bush_43_10-19-04_Stpete.jpg|thumb|left|George W.

One explanation of this quick wind-up of the war, would be that the Imperial Troopers (whom George Lucas has identified as being clones [STARLOG magazine issue # 300 page 42- 43], thus with the same follower mentality of the Clonetroopers) simply obeyed the orders of those they deemed to be next in line of authority: a newly recreated Senate.  Such a rapid recreation of government would be consistent with the patient long-term planning seen in the character of former Senator Mon Mothma.<br/> <br/>-In [[George W.

Bush won 271 [[U.S. Electoral College|electoral votes]] to Gore's 266, including the electoral votes of 30 of the 50 states. Neither candidate received a majority of the popular vote -- Bush received 47.9 %; Gore, 48.4 % -- but Gore received a [[plurality]] of about 540,000 more of the 105,000,000 votes cast. Most of the votes that neither Bush nor Gore won went to [[Green Party (United States)]] candidate [[Ralph Nader]] (2,695,696 votes/2.7%), [[Reform Party of the United States of America]] candidate [[Pat Buchanan]], (449,895/0.4%), and [[Libertarian Party (United States)]] candidate [[Harry Browne]] (386,024 votes/0.4%). <br/>+In the Expanded Universe, the Galactic Civil War still continued after the Battle of Endor for many years. With the destruction of the Galactic Empire's central leadership, the instituion  fell into warlordism, becoming disorganized and weak - much like the Rebel Alliance was in the early days of the Galactic Civil War. Even still, the Empire was still a formidable threat to the New Republic, and controlled much of the galaxy. In an effort to fully restore the galaxy to a peaceful state, the New Republic began a campaign of recapturing vital Imperial worlds, including  [[Coruscant]], the former capital of the [[Old Republic]] and the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] alike. The Empire rose again several times under powerful leaders such as [[Grand Admiral Thrawn]] and a series of clones of Palpatine, but was always thwarted when those leaders were killed.<br/> <br/>-It was the first presidential election since [[Benjamin Harrison]] was elected President in [[U.S. presidential election, 1888|1888]] in which the winning candidate received fewer popular votes than his opponent. It was the first since [[Rutherford Hayes]] was elected in [[U.S. presidential election, 1876]] in which the winner of the electoral vote was in dispute and affected by a [[Supreme Court of the United States]] decision. The Florida totals, which favored Bush in the initial tallies, became hotly contested after concerns were raised about irregularities in the voting and tabulation processes. Al Gore, who had conceded the election in a phone call to Bush, rescinded that concession a few hours later. <br/>+Later, a peace treaty was finally signed between the New Republic and the tiny fraction of the galaxy that was under the control of what remained of the Empire, 19 years after the Rebels' victory at Yavin. At this time the [[Imperial Remnant]], led by Grand Admiral [[Gilad Pellaeon]], consisted of eight backwater sectors bordering the Unknown Regions in the Outer Rim.<br/> <br/>-A series of contentious court cases ensued regarding the legality of county-specific and statewide recounts. After machine and manual recounts in four counties, and with Bush still prevailing, the [[Florida Supreme Court]] ordered a statewide manual recount of all counties. The Bush campaign appealed to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]], which, in its mid-December decision in ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'', overturned the decision and halted all recounts. (Critics have pointed out that a number of the justices were appointed by his father, contending that they should have recused themselves, although that position too was subject to much criticism.)

Bush also won a majority of the popular vote: 50.73% to Kerry's 48.27%. Bush's popular vote total, at 62,000,000, is the largest ever, with Kerry's total of 59,000,000 being the second largest. Bush was the first presidential candidate since his father, [[George H.W. Bush]] in [[U.S. presidential election, 1988|1988]] to receive a majority of the popular vote. As in the 2000 election, there were charges raised alleging [[2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities|voting irregularities]], especially in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. In 2004 they did not lead to recounts that were expected to affect the result. After a [[2004 U.S. presidential election recounts and legal challenges#Ohio: U.S. Congress electoral contest|congressional electoral contest]] -- the second in American history -- failed with votes of 1-74 by the Senate and 31-267 in the House, a [[Moss v.

The oath was administered by [[Chief Justice of the United States]], [[William Rehnquist]]. Bush's inaugural speech centered mainly on a theme of spreading [[freedom]] and [[democracy]] around the world.

This action had strong international support, and the Taliban government folded quickly after the invasion. Subsequent nation-building efforts in concert with the [[United Nations]] under Afghan president [[Hamid Karzai]] have had mixed results; bin Laden was not apprehended or killed, and ([[as of 2005]]) is still at large. A sizeable contingent of troops and advisors remains into 2005. See [[U.S. invasion of Afghanistan]] for details. [[Afghan presidential election, 2004|Democratic elections]] were held on [[October 9]], [[2004]].

The proposed system has been the subject of much [[National_Missile_Defense#July 2003 Report of the American Physical Society|scientific criticism]]. Field tests have been mixed, with both some successes and failures. It is scheduled to start deployment in 2005. A ballistic missile defense system will not stop [[cruise missile]]s, or missiles transported by boat or land vehicle. Hence, many critics of the system believe it is an expensive mistake, built for the least likely attack, a nuclear tipped ballistic missile. Bush has also increased spending on military [[research and development]] and the [[modernization]] of weapons systems, but cancelled programs such as the overbudgeted [[XM2001 Crusader]] self-propelled [[artillery]] system and the [[Comanche_helicopter|Comanche]] helicopter.

After the 9/11 attacks, the Bush administration argued that the situation in Iraq had now become urgent. The Administration contended that Saddam Hussein was a threat to U.S. interests, destabilized the [[Middle East]], inflamed the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]], gave financial support to [[terrorists]] and had [[WMD]]. While many members of previous U.S. administrations and other governments have come to agree with these assertions, another alleged motive given for the invasion of Iraq has been over the issue of [[petroleum]], which has created further controversy.<br/>-<br/>-A controversy has also arisen over evidence of Iraq's armaments presented during the buildup to war. Conflicting intelligence reports noted that Saddam's regime had tried to acquire [[nuclear material]] and the U.S. argued that it had not properly accounted for [[biological weapons]] and [[chemical weapons]] material that it was known to possess, potential [[weapons of mass destruction]] (WMD) in violation of [[Iraq sanctions|U.N. sanctions]]. There is debate between supporters and opponents of the war about whether the U.S. had any evidence that Iraq possessed WMD and whether they had any evidence of ties between Iraq and [[Al-Qaeda]].

Beginning in 2002 and escalating in spring 2003, Bush pressed the [[UN]] to act on its [[disarmament]] mandates to Iraq, precipitating a [[Iraq disarmament crisis|diplomatic crisis]]. He began by pushing for UN weapons inspections in Iraq, which the UN instituted under [[UN Security Council Resolution 1441]]. [[Hans Blix]] and [[Mohamed ElBaradei]] led UN weapons inspectors in Iraq. There were occasional lapses in cooperation and limits on inspections set by the Iraqi government, leading to intense debate over the efficacy of inspections. Four days before the commencement of full-scale hostilities, the United States advised U.N. weapons inspectors to leave Iraq, and they departed the country. [http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2003-03-17-inspectors-iraq_x.htm] After Saddam's capture, interrogators asked him, "If you had no weapons of mass destruction then why not let the U.N. inspectors into your facilities?" Saddam replied, "We didn&#8217;t want them to go into the presidential areas and intrude on our privacy.".

Bush has asked Congress to make the tax cuts permanent. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, by 2003 these tax cuts had reduced total federal revenue, as a percentage of the [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP), to the lowest level since 1959. [http://www.cbpp.org/10-21-03tax.htm]<br/>-<br/>-Recession, the Bush tax cuts, and increases in outlays for the military and the [[Department of Homeland Security]] all contributed to record [[budget deficit]]s during the Bush administration.  The annual deficit reached record current-dollar levels of $374,000,000,000 in 2003 and $413,000,000,000 in 2004.

In this projection the deficit will fall to 368,000,000,000 (USD) in 2005, 261,000,000,000 (USD) in 2007, and 207,000,000,000 (USD) in 2009, with a small surplus by 2012. The CBO noted, however, that this projection "omits a significant amount of spending that will occur this year--and possibly for some time to come--for [[U.S. military]] operations in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]] and for other activities related to the global [[War on Terrorism]]."  The projection also assumes that the Bush tax cuts "will expire as scheduled on [[December 31]], [[2010]]". If, as Bush has urged, the tax cuts were to be extended, then "the budget outlook for 2015 would change from a surplus of 141,000,000,000 (USD) to a deficit of 282,000,000,000 (USD)".<br/>-<br/>-[[Inflation]] under Bush has remained at about 2-3% per year.

Initially, Bush emphasized his proposal for partial [[privatization]], which would allow individual workers to invest a portion of their Social Security Tax (FICA) into personal [[retirement]] accounts. The main idea behind this privatization of Social Security is to allow workers to actually own the money they place into retirement, as with the existing social security system, a person who passes on loses all benefits they paid for, and the benefits are non-transferable, even to family members.<br/>-<br/>-One criticism of this approach was that it would actually worsen the imbalance between [[revenue]]s and [[expense]]s that Bush pointed to as a looming problem.

Seniors can buy a Medicare-approved discount card for $30 or less to help offset the increasing costs of prescription drugs.

His supporters believe he's done well with the [[Domestic_policy_of_the_George_W._Bush_administration|economy]], homeland security, and showed good leadership after the September 11 attacks.  His detractors have disagreed on those very subjects and have also criticized the passage of the [[USA PATRIOT Act]], the [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|controversial 2000 election]], and the [[2003_invasion_of_Iraq|2003 invasion of Iraq]].  The magazine ''[[TIME]]'' named Bush as its [[Person of the Year]] for 2000 and for 2004. This award is traditionally given to the person considered by the editors to be the most important newsmaker of the year. Due to Bush's colorful mistakes when speaking, detractors coined a new term, [[bushism]], to describe the grammatical configuration unique to Bush. Bushisms have been widely popularized across many websites on the internet due to their sense of humor. Some of his detractors, with varying degrees of seriousness, consider him unintelligent. On the other hand, his score on the Air Force Officer Qualifying Test (at age 22) suggests that his [[I.Q.]] was the mid-120's, above average.<br/>-<br/>-=== Domestic ===<br/>-<!-- <br/>-Anyone who vandalizes the page may be blocked for 24 hours or more without further warning. --><br/>-<br/>-[[Image:Time_2004_poty.jpg|thumb|175px|Bush as ''TIME'' Person of the Year 2004.]]<br/>-<br/>-[[Image:Bush approval ratings line graph Feb 2001 to Aug 2005.png|thumb|250px|left|Bush approval rating from February 2001 to August 2005.  Notable spikes in his approval rating followed the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], and the beginning of the [[2003 Iraq conflict]].]]<br/>-<br/>-In the time of national crisis following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], Bush enjoyed approval ratings of greater than 85%. Since then, Bush's approval ratings and approval of handling of domestic, economic, and foreign policy issues has steadily dropped.  For a comprehensive look, one can see an image of polling trends over the course of Bush's presidency [http://www.ipsos-na.com/news/pa/presidentialRatings.cfm here.]<br/>-<br/>-During the 2002 midterm congressional elections, Bush had the highest approval rating of any president during a midterm election since [[Dwight Eisenhower]]. In an unusual deviation from the historical trend of midterm elections, the Republican Party retook control of the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and added to their majority in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]; typically, the President's party loses Congressional seats in the midterm elections, and 2002 marked only the third midterm election since the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] that the party in control of the White House gained seats in both houses of Congress (others were 1902 and 1934).<br/>-<br/>-In 2003, Bush's approval spiked upward at the time of the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster]] in February. The upward trend continued through the invasion of Iraq in March. By late 2003, when presidential opponents typically begin their campaigns in earnest, his approval numbers were in the low to middle 50s. Most polls tied the decline to growing concern over the [[U.S.-led occupation of Iraq]] and a slow recovery from the 2001 recession. Polls of May 2004 showed anywhere from a 53 % approval rating [http://www.rasmussenreports.com/Bush_Job_Approval.htm] to a 46 % approval rating. [http://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/polls/usatodaypolls.htm] More recently, a poll taken by American Research Group on August 18-21, 2005 [http://americanresearchgroup.com/economy/] shows that 36% approve of the way Bush is handling his job as president (6% below the number in July), while 58% disapprove. This figure is lower than that of any modern President in his second term, including President Nixon's approval rating of 39% during the [[Watergate]] scandal that eventually led to his resignation, though not lower than President [[Jimmy Carter]]'s nadir of 17%. A concurrent Gallup Poll performed August 28-30, 2005 showed a 45% approval and 52% disapproval rating. [http://www.gallup.com/poll/stateNation/] A [[John Zogby|Zogby]] Poll of September 6-7, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, showed a 41% approval, an all-time low in Zogby's presidential polling record for President Bush. The poll also showed President Bush's favorability ratings going below 50% for the first time as 49% saw him as favourable and 50% viewed him unfavourably. [http://zogby.com/news/ReadNews.dbm?ID=1020]  A [[CBS News]] poll conducted October 3-5, 2005 showed that Bush's approval rating had  dropped to 37%, his lowest to date measured by CBS News.

In the aftermath of the disaster, thousands of city residents, unable or unwilling to evacuate prior to the hurricane, became stranded with little to no relief for several days resulting in [[Effect_of_Hurricane_Katrina_on_New_Orleans#Superdome_refuge|lawless and unsanitary conditions]] in some areas. Although blame was also attributed to state and local authorities, the public outcry was most prominently directed at the Bush administration, mainly [[FEMA]] and the [[Department of Homeland Security]] alleging weak crisis management and coordination. The Bush Administration faced accusations of slow response and mismanagement from members of Congress and other public figures. Many critics noted that the potential for disaster involving a breach of the New Orleans levees was well-documented, by both FEMA and the Louisiana State University. The Bush Administration like previous administrations failed to address the concern, and consistantly funded less than was requested by the Army Corps of Engineers to maintain the levees, although this did not impact the part of the levies that failed. The criticism and poor plannings of the local government led to the resignation of FEMA director [[Michael Brown]] and a September 15, 2005, admission by Bush that mistakes had been made by his administration. Brown's weak qualifications came under scrutiny during this time and his appointment is regarded by some as a blatant case of cronyism.[http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/09/28/bush.cronyism][http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/08/AR2005090802165.html][http://www.time.com/time/press_releases/article/0,8599,1109304,00.html][http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,1109345,00.html]<br/>+In the Computer Game [[Star Wars: X-wing]], the first campaign (before the [[Battle of Yavin]]) concerns Operation "Strike Fear", which is meant to crush the Alliance.

Might add a proper discog though with their singles, unless you wanna beat me to it? Are you signed up to the Engerica forum by the way?<br/>+'''Combining form'''&nbsp;&nbsp;In word-formation, a  [[bas (linguistics)|base]] designed to combine with another, either also a combining form or a free word: ''bio-'' with ''-graphy'' to form ''biography'', ''mini-'' with ''skirt'' to form ''miniskirt''. A vowel usually facilitates the combination: in ''biography'', the Greek  [[thematic vowel]] -''o''-, in ''miniskirt'', the Latin thematic -''i''-. This vowel is usually regarded as attached to the initial base (''bio-'', ''mini-'') rather than the final base (''-graphy'', ''-skirt''), but in Greek-derived forms it is sometimes shown as attached to the final base (''-ography'', ''-ology''). If, however, the final base begins with a vowel (for example, ''-archy'' as in ''monarchy''), the mediating vowel has traditionally been avoided (no *''monoarchy''), but in recent coinages it is often kept and generally accompanied by a hyphen (''auto-analysis'', ''bio-energy'', ''hydro-electricity'', not *''autanalysis'', *''bienergy'', *''hydrelectricity'').<br/> <br/>-Chipstick<br/>+===Translation===<br/>+There are hundreds of combining forms in English and other European languages. As traditionally defined, they cannot stand alone as free words, but there are many exceptions to this rule, and in the late 20c such forms are increasingly used independently: ''bio'' as a clipping of ''biography'', ''telly'' as a respelt clipping of ''television''. Most combining forms translate readily into everyday language, especially nouns: ''bio-'' as ‘life’ ''-graphy'' as ‘writing, description’. Because of this, the compounds of which they are part (usually ''classical'' or ''learned compounds'') can be more or less straightforwardly paraphrased: ''biography'' as ‘writing about a life’, ''neurology'' as ‘the study of the nervous system’. Many combining forms are designed to take initial or final position: ''autobiography'' has the two initial or preposed forms ''auto-'', ''bio-'', and one postposed form ''-graphy''. Although most occupy one position or the other, some can occupy both: ''-graph-'' as in ''graphology'' and ''monograph''; ''-phil-'' as in ''philology'' and ''Anglophile''. Occasionally, the same base is repeated in one word: ''logology'' the study of words, ''phobophobia'' the fear of fear.<br/> <br/>-Thanx for the appreciation, feel free to add to the discog, just finished it. <br/>+===Preposed and postposed===<br/>+Forms that come first include: ''aero-'' air, ''crypto-'' hidden, ''demo-'' people, ''geo-'' earth, ''odonto-'' tooth, ''ornitho-'' bird, ''thalasso'' sea. Many have both a traditional simple meaning and a modern telescopic meaning: in ''biology'', ''bio-'' means ‘life’, but in ''bio-degradable'' it telescopes ‘biologically’; although ''hypno-'' basically means ‘sleep’ (''hypnopaedia'' learning through sleep), it also stands for ‘hypnosis’ (''hypnotherapy'' cure through hypnosis). When a form stands alone as a present-day word, it is usually a telescopic abbreviation: ''bio'' biography, ''chemo'' chemotherapy, ''hydro'' hydroelectricity, ''metro'' metropolitan. Some telescoped forms can be shorter than the original combining forms: ''gynie'' is shorter than ''gyneco-'' and stands for both ''gynecology'' and ''gynecologist''; ''anthro'' is shorter than ''anthropo-'' and stands for ''anthropology''. Forms that come second include: ''-ectomy'' cutting out, ''-graphy'' writing, description, ''-kinesis'' motion, ''-logy'' study, ''-mancy'' divination, ''-onym'' name, ''-phagy'' eating, ''-phony'' sound, ''-therapy'' healing, ''-tomy'' cutting. They are generally listed in dictionaries without the interfixed vowel, which appears however in such casual phrases as ‘ologies and isms’.<br/> <br/>-Fabrib<br/>+===Variants===<br/>+Some combining forms are variants of one base. The Greek base ''-graph-''underlies three combining forms in English: ''-gram'' something written or shaped, etc. (''telegram'', ''hologram''), ''-graph'' something written or a piece of equipment (''autograph'', ''polygraph''), ''-graphy'' the activity or business of writing, shaping, etc. (''telegraphy'', ''holography''). Some are also free words, such as ''mania'' in ''dipsomania'' and ''phobia'' in ''claustrophobia''. Some are composites of other elements, such as ''encephalo-'' brain, from ''en-'' in, ''-cephal-'' head, and ''-ectomy'' cutting out, from ''ec-'' out, ''-tom-'' cut, ''-y'', a noun-forming suffix.<br/> <br/>-==The Fratellis==<br/>+===Origins===<br/>+In Greek and Latin grammar, combining bases usually require a thematic or stem-forming vowel. In ''biography'', from Greek, the thematic is -''o''-; in ''agriculture'', from Latin, it is ''-i-''. In English, which does not inflect in this way and has no native thematic vowels, an element like -''o''- is an imported glue that holds bases together. Its presence helps to distinguish classical compounds like ''biography'' and ''agriculture'' from vernacular compounds like ''teapot'' and ''blackbird''. Generally, English has acquired its classical compounds in three ways: through French from Latin and Greek, directly from Latin and Greek, and by coinage in English on Greek and Latin patterns. An exception is ''schizophrenia'', which came into English through German, and is therefore pronounced ‘skitso’, not ‘skyzo’. The combining forms and the compounds built from them are as much a part of English as of Latin and Greek, and as much a part of French, Spanish, Italian, and any other language that cares to use them. They are an international resource.<br/> <br/>-Just to let you know that you have placed an incorrect image in The Fratellis article - you have placed a picture of the American Fratellis (the metal and uncool ones), while the article is about the Scottish indie band. I'm gonna have to remove it. Sorry!! [[User:Cs-wolves|Cs-wolves]] 21:12, 1 July 2006 (UTC)<br/>+===The conservative tradition===<br/>+From the [[Renaissance]] until the mid-20c, the concept of derivational purity has generally regulated the use of combining forms: Greek with Greek, Latin with Latin, and a minimum of hybridization. ''Biography'' is Greek, ''agriculture'' Latin, but ''television'' is a hybrid of Greek ''tele-'' and Latin ''-vision'' (probably so coined because the ‘pure’ form ''telescope'' had already been adopted for another purpose). ''Kiddology'' facetiously combines vernacular ''kid'' and ''-ology'' to produce ‘the science of kidding people’. Most dictionaries follow the ''OED'' in using ''combining form'' (''comb. form'') to label such classical elements, but the name is not widely known. In appendices to dictionaries and grammar books, combining forms are often loosely referred to as roots or affixes: ‘a logo …, properly speaking, is not a word at all but a prefix meaning word and short for logogram, a symbol, much as telly is short for television’ (Montreal ''Gazette'', 13  Apr.  1981). They are often referred to as affixes because some come first and some come last, but if they were affixes, a word like ''biography'' would have no base whatever. While affixes are grammatical (like prepositions), combining forms are [[lexicon|lexical]] (like nouns, adjectives, and verbs): for example, ''bio-'' translates as a noun (life), ''-graphy'' as a verbal noun (writing). They are also often loosely called roots because they are ancient and have a basic role in wordformation, but functionally and often structurally they are distinct from roots: the ''-graph'' in ''autograph'' is both a root and a combining form, while the ''-graphy'' in ''cryptography'' consists of root ''-graph-'' and suffix ''-y'', and is only a combining form.<br/> <br/>-oh no worries. sorry bought that<br/>+===Contemporary developments===<br/>+By and large, combining forms were a closed system from the 16c to the earlier 20c: the people who used them were classically educated, their teachers and exemplars generally took a purist's view on their use, contexts of use were mainly technical, and there was relatively little seepage into the language at large. However, with the decline of classical education and the spread of technical and quasi-technical jargon in the media, a continuum has evolved, with at least five stages:<br/> <br/>-its cool honestly. [[User:Cs-wolves|Cs-wolves]] 21:46, 1 July 2006 (UTC)<br/>+====Pure classical usage====<br/>+In the older sciences, combining forms are generally used to form such strictly classical and usually Greek compounds as: ''anthocyanin'', ''astrobleme'', ''chemotherapy'', ''chronobiology'', ''cytokinesis'', ''glossolalia'', ''lalophobia'', ''narcolepsy'', ''osteoporosis'', ''Pliohippus'', ''sympathomimetic''.<br/> <br/>-==Welcome!==<br/>+====Hybrid classical usage====<br/>+In technical, semitechnical, and quasi-technical usage at large, coiners of compounds increasingly treat Latin and Greek as one resource, to produce such forms as: ''accelerometer'', ''aero-generator'', ''bioprospector'', ''communicology'', ''electroconductive'', ''futurology'', ''mammography'', ''micro-gravity'', ''neoliberal'', ''Scientology'', ''servomechanism'', ''Suggestopedia''.<br/> <br/>-Hello, {{PAGENAME}}, and [[Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]] to Wikipedia!

Processes of analogy have created coinages like ''petrodollar'', ''psycho-warfare'', ''microwave'' on such models as ''petrochemical'', ''psychology'', ''microscope''. Such stunt usages as ''eco-doom'', ''eco-fears'', ''eco-freaks'', common in journalism, often employ combining forms telescopically: ''eco-''standing for ''ecology'' and ''ecological'' and not as used in ''economics''. In such matters, precision of meaning is secondary to compactness and vividness of expression.<br/> <br/>-''If you are interested in Russia-related themes'', you may want to check out the [[Portal:Russia|Russian Portal]], particularly the [[Portal:Russia/New article announcements]] and [[Portal:Russia/Russia-related Wikipedia notice board]].

The same spoken usage may be written ''micro-missile'', ''micro missile'', ''micromissile'', reflecting the same uncertainty or flexibility as in ''businessman'', ''business-man'', ''business man''. When used in such ways, combining forms are often telescopic: ''Hydro substation'' Hydro-Electricity Board substation, ''Metro highways'' Metropolitan highways, ''porno cult'' pornography cult.<br/> <br/>-Again, welcome!

of [[Roman Emperor]], especially during the [[crisis of the Third Century]].<br/>+<br/>+These are customarily referred to as the [[Thirty Tyrants (Roman)|Thirty Tyrants]], which was an allusion to the [[Thirty Tyrants]] at [[Athens]] some five hundred years earlier; although the comparison is questionable, and the Romans were separate aspirants, not (as the Athenians were) a [[Committee of Public Safety]]. The [[Loeb Classical Library|Loeb]] translation of the appropriate chapter of the [[Augustan History]] therefore represents the Latin ''triginta tyranni'' by "Thirty Pretenders" to avoid this artificial and confusing parallel.  Not all of them were afterwards considered ''pretenders''; several were actually successful in becoming Emperor in at least in part of the Empire for a brief period.<br/>+<br/>+==The Byzantine Empire==<br/>+Disputed successions to the Empire continued at [[Constantinople]]. Most seriously, after the fall of Constantinople to the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204, and its eventual recovery by [[Michael VIII Palaeologus]], there came to be three Bysantine successor states, each of which claimed to be the Roman Empire, and several Latin claimants (including the [[Republic of Venice]] and the houses of [[Marquess of Montferrat|Montferrat]] and [[Philip of Courtenay|Courtenay]]) to the [[Latin Empire]] the Crusaders had set up in its place. There were sometimes multiple claimants to some of the inheritances, as well.<br/>+<br/>+== Cypriot pretenders==<br/>+Following the defeat and death of King Jacques III of Cyprus in 1474, his younger and illegitimate brother, [[Barons di Baccari|Eugene Matteo de Armenia]] (c1485-1523) had moved to Sicily, then Malta. He was acknowledged as Heir to Cyprus, Armenia, Jerusalem and Antioch, though never took it seriously. From a genealogical point, [[Barons di Baccari|Eugene Matteo (de Lusignan) de Armenia]] was created a [[Barons di Baccari|Sicilian title]] and worked as a [[Maltese nobility|Jurat in Malta]] and in [[Sicily]].<br/>+<br/>+== French pretenders ==<br/>+Following the death of the childless legitimist pretender "Henry V", [[Comte de Chambord]], grandson of King [[Charles X of France]] in the 1880s, the majority of French monarchists accepted the Comte's selection as heir, his distant relative, the Orleanist pretender, the [[Comte de Paris]], grandson of King [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe]] (who descends from King [[Louis XIII]]) as the pretender to the French throne. A small minority refused to accept this designation, and chose instead a descendant of Louis XIV and the Spanish line. <br/>+<br/>+The arguments are, on one side, that [[Philip V of Spain]] renounced any future claim to the French throne when he became King of Spain, and that the [[Duke of Orléans|Dukes of Orleans]] were therefore recognized as the next heirs before the [[French Revolution]]. On the other side, that this renunciation was invalid and impossible, and (in some cases) that [[Philippe Égalité]] and Louis-Philippe forfeited any remaining right to the crown for disloyalty.  Hence there are two pretenders to the French throne; though the [[Orleanist]] pretender, the present [[Comte de Paris]], is accepted by most French monarchists as ''the'' pretender, as the list above shows. <br/>+<br/>+There is also a pretender to the imperial throne of France, in the person of [[Napoléon Joseph Charles Paul Bonaparte the 2nd|Charles Bonaparte]], descendant of the [[Napoléon Joseph Charles Paul Bonaparte|Prince Napoléon]].<br/>+<br/>+== Russian Pretenders ==<br/>+There is much debate over who is the legitimate heir to the Russian throne. [[George Mikhailovitch of Russia|George of Russia]], son of [[Maria Vladimirovna of Russia]], is considered by some to be the legitimate heir, being the grandson of a cousin of Czar [[Nicholas II of Russia]]. Unequal marriages have made tracking a legitimate heir to the Russian throne very difficult, and some believe there is no legitimate heir at all. [[Nicholas Romanov]], the president of [[Romanov Family Association]], a junior male descendant of the imperial family, is regarded by some as the head of the family, but he is born of a [[morganatic marriage]] and therefore not entitled to inherit the throne under strict Russian succession law. The last male dynast, [[Grand Duke Vladimir of Russia|Grand Duke Vladimir]], did not die until [[1992]]. Those who impersonated the murdered daughters of Nicholas II were not pretenders to the throne, as women could not succeed to the Russian throne while a male dynast was alive. [[Anna Anderson]] attempted to prove she was the lost daughter of [[Nicholas II]], [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia|Anastasia]], but DNA testing on her remains proved her claim false.<br/>+<br/>+== English, Irish, Scottish, Welsh and British pretenders ==<br/>+{{Cleanup|date=February 2007}}<br/>+<br/>+Pretenders to the thrones of the United Kingdom and its predecessor realms, as well as the other historical jurisdictions that are modernly England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, were essentially taken care of by making the Irish and English (and subsequently, British) monarchies purely statutory institutions.  Ireland further precluded any and all possible pretenders by declaring itself a republic in 1949.<br/>+<br/>+Prior to the [[Norman Conquest]] of [[1066]], [[Anglo-Saxon England]] used a system of [[elective monarchy|elective kingship]].  England originated, in fact, about the year [[802]], as an amalgam of several kingdoms ([[Wessex]], [[Sussex]], [[Kent]], [[Mercia]], [[East Anglia]], etc.) under the transnational leadership of [[Egbert of Wessex]].  The [[Witenagemot]] had the right to determine the kingship.<br/>+<br/>+The Norman Conquest eliminated elective kingship in England - for a few centuries - by replacing the Witenagemot with the Norman institution known as the ''[[Curia Regis]]'', while The [[Thing (assembly)|Thing]] simply disappeared.  Gradually, however, the Normans became English; and modern forms of the old Anglo-Saxon institutions began to re-emerge.  To this day, the form of Coronation contains vestigial elements of the consent of the people. In time, the new Parliament began to re-assert its ancient predecessor's right to choose the king, culminating in an Act of 1649, without the Royal Assent of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], on the morning of his execution. However, the power is now held to be vested in the Crown in Parliament, so that an Act was necessary to effect the abdication of [[King Edward VIII]] in 1936. It is arguable whether or not the Sovereign has the right to withhold either the Sovereign's Consent to consider such a Bill, or the Royal Assent to such an Act)<br/>+<br/>+The change was first noticeable in England following the accession of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], after a long period of strife and civil wars that began when [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] deposed [[Richard II of England|Richard II]].  When Henry drafted his deed of succession - naming, first, his son, Edward, to succeed him; then, his two daughters, Mary and Elizabeth, in birth order - he submitted the document to Parliament for approval.  When the regents for Edward then tried to change the succession to skip the teenage king's sisters, in favour of his cousin [[Lady Jane Grey]] - (in fact, Edward's cousin [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary Stewart/Stuart, the girl Queen of Scots]] was the next heir after Elizbeth and before Jane) - Edward signed the document but it did not have the approval of Parliament.  Jane is still counted England's first queen regnant, but she only reigned nine days before Mary Tudor arrived from Lincoln.  Mary was instantly recognised as Queen without fuss or question.<br/>+<br/>+Attempts to disrupt the statutory nature of the monarchy in England were made by some of the Stuart monarchs, who had not experienced the English checks on royal power when they ruled in Scotland.  The [[Act of Settlement 1701]] took care of that problem, and the [[Act of Union 1707]] essentially extended the Act of Settlement to Scotland.  The [[Act of Union 1800]] subsequently extended the Act of Settlement to Ireland, but the Irish monarchy had already been made a statutory institution when [[Henry VIII of England]] was named King of Ireland by the Irish Parliament in 1542. Previously, the English kings had been styled Lord of Ireland.<br/>+<br/>+Nevertheless, there have been some great pretenders over the centuries.  A few famous ones are noted here, and a few passive claims are still made.<br/>+<br/>+[[James Francis Edward Stuart]] was the Roman Catholic son of the deposed King [[James VII and II]], forever eclipsed in the succession to the throne by the [[Act of Settlement 1701]].  Notwithstanding the [[Act of Union 1707]], he claimed the separate thrones of Scotland, as James VIII, and of England and Ireland, as James III, until his death in 1766. In Jacobite thinking, Acts of Parliament (of England or Scotland) after 1688, (including the Acts of Union) did not receive the required [[royal assent]] of the "legitimate" (Jacobite) monarch and, therefore, were without legal effect.<br/>+<br/>+James's sons carried on their own claims.  [[Charles Edward Stuart]], the would-be Charles III, still famously known as ''Bonnie Prince Charlie'', died in 1788.  He is unquestionably the most famous pretender in British history, if not world history. His younger brother, [[Henry Benedict Stuart]], took up the mantle after his death, if only symbolically, as the would-be Henry IX of England. He died in 1807.<br/>+<br/>+James VIII & III was commonly called "the King over the water", because he was resident in France (across the Channel) and is also known as ''The Old Pretender.'' (As no Jacobite monarch since has resided in Britain, Jacobites ever since have toasted 'the King/Queen over the water'.) Bonnie Prince Charlie is also called ''The Young Pretender.''  See [[Jacobitism]] and [[:Category:Jacobite pretenders|the related category]] for more information including the current Jacobite "pretender".<br/>+<br/>+[[Owain Glyndŵr]] (1349-1416) is probably the best-known Welsh pretender, though whether he was pretender or Prince of Wales depends upon your source of information.  Officially, [[Llywelyn ap Gruffydd ap Llywelyn]], who died in 1282, was the last native and arguably greatest Prince of Wales.  Since 1301, the Prince of Wales has been the eldest living son of the King or Queen Regnant of England (subsequently of Great Britain, 1707, and of United Kingdom, 1801).  The word "living" is important.  Upon the death of [[Arthur, Prince of Wales]], Henry VII invested his second son, the future Henry VIII, with the title. The title is not automatic, however, but merges into the Crown when a prince dies or accedes to the throne, and has to be re-conferred by the sovereign.<br/>+<br/>+Nevertheless, it is Glyndŵr whom many remember as the last native Prince of Wales.  He was indeed proclaimed Prince of Wales by his supporters on 16 September 1400, and his revolt in quest of Welsh independence was not quashed by [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] until 1409.  Later, however, one of Glyndŵr's cousins, Owain Tudor, would marry the widow of [[Henry V of England|Henry V]], and their grandson would become [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], from whom the current British monarch is descended (through his daughter Margaret Tudor, who was married off to [[James IV of Scotland]]).  So, in a way, Glyndŵr might be said to have had the last laugh.<br/>+<br/>+The business of Irish pretenders is rather more complicated because of the nature of kingship in Ireland before the Norman take-over of 1171.  In both Ireland and Scotland, succession to kingship was elective, often (if not usually) by contest, according to matrilineal descent.  That is, the head of state of any kingdom, sub-kingdom, high kingdom, etc., was always a king, but the king always inherited the crown through his mother, as a ranking princess royal, not through his father. (See, e.g., ''The Lion in the North:  A Personal View of Scotland's History'', by John Prebble ISBN 0-14-003652-0 ; among other works.)<br/>+<br/>+Thus, you, as king, would not be succeeded by your own son but would normally be succeeded by your mother's other sons; then by your sisters' sons; then, your maternal aunt's sons; and so on, traveling through the female line of the royal house.  This combination of male succession through matrilineal descent produced a cumbersome system under which the throne passed cyclically from brother to brother, then uncle to nephew, and then cousin to cousin, before starting over as brother to brother, uncle to nephew, etc. {See, e.g., ''The Lion in the North:  A Personal View of Scotland's History'', by John Prebble; among other works.}  In Ireland, however, the high king from the time of Maelsheachlainn I (died 862) exercised a measure of control over the country.  He belonged to the Ui Neill dynasty and under the Brehon laws, succession was open to any kinsman up to and including second cousin.  His dynasty is today represented by the O'Neill family who would regard their head as the pretender.  The O Conor dynasty provided two high kings and the head of the family, the O Conor Don, would also be considered a pretender to the Irish throne.  The descendants of Brian Boroimhe are represented by Lord Inchiquin, who is also regarded as a claimant.  In addition, pretenders or claimants exist to the localised kingdoms of Breifne, Fermanagh, Tyrconnel and Leinster.  The O'Neills would also be regarded as claimants to the throne of Aileach and Lord Inchiquin to the throne of Thomond.<br/>+<br/>+In Scotland, [[Malcolm II of Scotland|Malcolm II]] tried to get around this system by killing off all of the heirs between himself and his grandson, Duncan; except for Prince [[Lulach of Scotland|Lulach]] of Moray, who was just five years old at the time and - more importantly - was successfully rumoured to be half-witted (thus, he survived).  [[Duncan I of Scotland|Duncan I]] did become king, but Lulach's step-father, Maelbeth -rendered "[[Macbeth of Scotland|Macbeth]]" in English - successfully claimed the throne in his own right and on Lulach's behalf.<br/>+<br/>+Duncan I's son, [[Malcolm III of Scotland|Malcolm III]] 'Canmore', ultimately returned from exile in England and took the throne from Maelbeth and Lulach (the latter reigning 1057-1058, after the death of Maelbeth in battle against Malcolm).  Malcolm was succeeded by his brother, as Duncan II, but then by four of his own sons - one of whom, [[Edgar of Scotland|Edgar]] (1097-1107), changed the official language of Scotland from Gàidhlig (then, still a Scottish dialect of Old Irish) to Scots (then, a language similar to English but missing the Saxon element that has always been part of standard English).  Gaelic dominance of Scotland ended during the reign of [[Alexander I of Scotland|Alexander I]] (1107-1124), and the old Celtic system of matrilineal kingship finally ended and was replaced by a system of primogeniture.<br/>+<br/>+Such a transition never happened in Ireland, but civil war and the imposition of Anglo-Norman rule intervened.  Although Ireland had been culturally unified for centuries, it was not politically unified, even as a tribal nation.  The Romans having ignored the big green island west of Britain, the Gaels themselves were the last people to successfully invade Ireland and, notwithstanding 750 years of English rule, it is very arguable whether the Norman English ever truly ''conquered'' Ireland.  (They controlled Ireland, certainly, but that is not all there is to conquest.)  So, even serious coastal encroachments by the Vikings a millennium after their arrival did not prompt the Gaels of Ireland to see a need for political unity even to build a concerted national defence.  When a people believe they and their country are immune from invasion, it takes a while for them to realise how vulnerable they actually are.<br/>+<br/>+The High King of Ireland was essentially a ceremonial, pseudo-federal overlord (where his over-lordship was even recognised), who exercised actual power only within the realm of which he was actually king.  In the case of the southern branch of the Uí Niall, this would have been the Kingdom of Meath (modernly the counties of Meath, West Meath and part of County Dublin).  High Kings from the northern branch of the family ruled various kingdoms in what eventually became the province of Ulster.<br/>+<br/>+Nevertheless, the Uí Niall were apparently powerful in ceremony if not in politic, so that political unification of Ireland was not aided by the usurpation of the high kingship from Mael Sechnaill II and the southern Uí Niall in 1002 by ''Briain ‘Boruma’ mac Cennédig'', of the Kingdom of Munster.  This was the third of the so-called "Three Usurpations of Brian Boru."  <br/>+<br/>+Brian Boru was a strong king who could have unified Ireland politically, and there is some suggestion he intended to make himself High King of Scotland as well.  But he was killed in the Battle of Contarf in 1014, and twelve years as High King was not long enough to unify the island politically.  Mael Sechnaill II was restored to the High Kingship but ''he'' died in 1022, too soon to undo the damage done by Brian's "coup."  From 1022 through the Norman take-over of 1171, the High Kingship was held by "Kings with Opposition" - that is, whoever was strong enough to overthrow the High King of the day and take the Hill of Tara simply did so.  This 150-year period of regnal unrest between families now called O'Brian, O'Conner, McLoughlin/O'Melaghlin, and others, was eventually immortalised in the children's game called "King of the Hill."  The game is still popular among American children, who take turns trying to push each other off a low stool, chair, or other make-shift hill while arguing, "I'm king of the hill!" "No! I'm king!"<br/>+<br/>+Because the native Irish high kingship never transitioned to a system of nation-state kingship primogeniture but simply faded into an oblivion of civil war between competing Irish royal families, there are literally as many as a million or more people who can make a claim to the ancient high kingship of Tara that is as equally valid as anybody else's under the old system disrupted by what may be called Brian Boru's "coup de tribe."  Indeed, as a reputed descendant of Brian Boru and of the Uí Niall Dynasty both through his late grandmother, the current heir to the statutory throne that includes Northern Ireland, [[Prince Charles]], could be considered a viable pretender to the high kingship of Ireland, especially as he ''would'' be making the claim through the female line of his ancestry. {The British Royal Family has publicly claimed descent from Brian Boru through the late Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, and from other ancestors associated with the Ui Niall Dynasty - usually via marriage through the Royal Family's Scottish ancestry; see the history section of the Royal Family's website for bloodlines and timelines.) But see the remarks above regarding existing native dynasties, whose claims are more valid than those of the current British royal family.<br/>+<br/>+Interestingly, there was some talk right after the 1916 Easter Rising in Ireland about inviting the Kaiser's son, Prince Joachim of Prussia, to be King of Ireland.  This was obviously anti-English sentiment following the execution of the leaders of the rebellion (except for Eamonn De Valera, who was an American citizen - born in New York City).  Paradoxically, Irish public opinion was ''against'' the Easter Rising and the leaders were spat upon when they surrendered - but when the government executed them instead of just sending them to prison, public opinion swung completely the other way, against Britain and ''for'' independence - except in the northeast, where the majority of people were (still are) an ethnic mix of Scots-Irish, Anglo-Irish, Norse-Irish, and native Irish minorities.<br/>+<br/>+Insomuch as the whole of Ireland was a province of United Kingdom in 1916, Prince Joachim would never have become King of Ireland even if he had wanted the job.  But if he ''had'' become king, and Ireland still had subsequently become a republic, Joachim's grandson, [[Franz Wilhelm Viktor Christoph Stephan|Franz]], would be an Irish pretender; and, afterward, his son, [[George Mikhailovitch of Russia|George of Russia]], would be an Irish as well as a Russian pretender.  But if the Irish could not put up with the constitutional monarchs of Britain, it's highly unlikely they would ever have put up with the ''absolute'' monarchs of Germany and Russia.<br/>+<br/>+== Ottoman pretenders ==<br/>+Eldest son during the reign of his father, [[Mehmet II|Mehmet the Conqueror]] claimed the Sultanate although he was defeated in battle months later by his eldest brother (by birth) [[Bayezid II]]. He fled to Rhodes Island then eventually to the Papal Territories.

Will is somewhat of a schemer and womanizer, frequently hatching plots to make money, get the girl, and have fun despite the wishes of his strict Uncle Phil.  Well-meaning but impulsive, street-smart but not very wise, many plot lines hinge on the unintended consequences of his actions.  A big heart and guilty conscience usually make sure he does the right thing in the end.  He has a wicked sense of humor and frequently jokes about Philip’s weight, Carlton’s height, and Hilary’s lack of wit.  Having grown up in the inner city, he is unaccustomed to the Banks’ affluence and sometimes looks down on them for it, a dynamic that inspires a significant amount of the show’s humor.  Despite this, it is clear that in time Will comes to consider the Banks’ his own family, as close to him as his mother.  At the conclusion of the series he remains in Los Angeles to continue his education.<br/> <br/>-===[[South Australia]]===<br/>-*[[University of Adelaide]] - ''[[On Dit]]''<br/>-*[[Flinders University]] - ''[[Empire Times]]''<br/>-*[[University of South Australia]] - ''[[Entropy (newspaper)|Entropy]]''<br/>+====Philip "Zeke" Banks====<br/>+The character of Philip Banks (Uncle Phil), referred to by his parents as Zeke, was portrayed by [[James L. Avery, Sr.|James Avery]]. At the beginning of the series, Philip is a [[lawyer]] with the firm of Firth, Wynn and Meyer, but in the third season is appointed a [[judge]] after the senile incumbent Judge Robertson ([[Sherman Hemsley]] in a recurring role), against whom Philip had earlier run an unsuccessful campaign, died suddenly. Philip later considers making a deeper foray into politics, but decides against it when his wife disapproves.<br/> <br/>-===[[Tasmania]]===<br/>-*[[University of Tasmania]] - ''[[Tog (newspaper)|Tog]]''<br/>+Philip is a somewhat strict and gruff man, but he does have a softer side, and is also an upstanding citizen. He was raised on a farm in [[Yamacraw, North Carolina]], went to [[Princeton University]] on scholarship, and in the [[1960s|60s]] became an activist for the civil rights movement. He was present at the riots in [[Selma, Alabama|Selma]] in 1965, and in the pilot episode also mentions he once heard [[Malcolm X]] speak.  In 1963, he was awarded a scholarship to study at [[Yale University]], after which he went to [[Harvard Law School]]. In 1975 he was put on the board of the [[NAACP]] and was later awarded the [[Urban Spirit Award]] for his work in promoting civil rights.<br/> <br/>-===[[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]]===<br/>-*[[La Trobe University]] - ''[[Rabelais Student Media]]''<br/>-*[[Melbourne University]] - ''[[University of Melbourne student services#Farrago|Farrago]]''<br/>-*[[Monash University]] - ''[[Lot's Wife]]''<br/>-*[[Deakin University]] - ''[[Crossfire (newspaper)|Crossfire]]''<br/>-*[[Victoria University of Technology]] - ''[[Seed (newspaper)|Seed]]''<br/>-*[[Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology]] - ''[[Catalyst (newspaper)|Catalyst]]''<br/>-*[[St Kevin's College]] - ''[[Kevinian]]''<br/>+====Vivian Banks====<br/>+The character of Vivian Banks (Aunt Viv) was portrayed by [[Janet Hubert-Whitten]] from [[1990]] to [[1993]], and by [[Daphne Reid]] (credited as Daphne Maxwell-Reid) from 1993 to [[1996]]. She is a professor of Black History and Literature at an undisclosed university, and in one early episode takes a temporary job as a teacher for a unit in Black History at Bel-Air Academy, the fictional upscale preparatory [[high school]] attended by Will and Carlton.  She has three sisters: Helen, Janice, and Will's mother Vy (Viola). <br/> <br/>-===[[Western Australia]]===<br/>-*[[University of Western Australia]] - ''[[Pelican (newspaper)|Pelican]]''<br/>+Vivian's personality and role in the show changes over the run of the series.  During the Janet Hubert-Whitten years she's a no-nonsense, forthright, career-minded woman who plays a part in the show equal to the Philip character.  After Maxwell-Reid took the part in 1993 and baby Nicky was added to the cast, the writers seemed to de-emphasize her former persona and generally portrayed her as a loving, supportive, non-confrontational homemaker with a smaller role in the show's plotlines.<br/> <br/>-== [[Canada]] ==<br/>-{{main|List of Canadian student newspapers}}<br/>-===Alberta===<br/>-*[[University of Alberta]] &ndash; ''[[The Gateway (newspaper)|The Gateway]]''<br/>-*[[Athabasca University]] &ndash; ''[[The Voice Magazine]]''<br/>-*[[University of Calgary]] &ndash; ''[[Gauntlet (newspaper)|The Gauntlet]]''<br/>-*[[Grant McEwen College]] &ndash; ''[[The Intercamp]]''<br/>-*[[University of Lethbridge]] &ndash; ''[[The Meliorist]]''<br/>+====Hilary Banks====<br/>+The character of Hilary Banks, Will's ditzy, stuck-up, spoiled eldest cousin, was portrayed by [[Karyn Parsons]]. In earlier seasons, Hilary's snobbishness is emphasized, as well as her shallow trendy environmental activism (which was later dropped). During this time she often claimed to hobnob with [[celebrity|celebrities]].  Later on, she's written as a self-centered airhead, with her funniest lines being comments that betray her comical ignorance. During the series she attends and drops out of [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], after which  she begins a [[Mr. Magoo]]-like streak of luck that eventually lands her a nationally-televised daytime talk show.  It starts when she becomes a weather reporter at a local [[television network|TV station]], where she meets and falls in love with [[news anchor]] Trevor Newsworthy (referred to as Trevor Collins in earlier episodes). However, he dies in a [[Bungee jumping|bungee]] accident while proposing marriage, part of an ill-conceived live [[publicity stunt]]. At the conclusion of the series her talk show ''Hilary!'' moves to [[New York City]], as does most of the rest of the Banks family.<br/> <br/>-===British Columbia===<br/>-*[[University College of the Fraser Valley]] &ndash; ''[[Cascade (newspaper)|Cascade]]''<br/>-*[[University of Northern British Columbia]] &ndash; ''[[The Over the Edge]]''<br/>-*[[Simon Fraser University]] &ndash; ''[[The Peak]]''<br/>-*[[Thompson Rivers University]] &ndash; ''[[Omega (newspaper)|Omega]]''<br/>-*[[Trinity Western University]] &ndash; ''[[Mars' Hill]]''<br/>-*[[University of Victoria]] &ndash; ''[[The Martlet]]''<br/>-*[[University of British Columbia]] &ndash; ''[[The Ubyssey]]''<br/>+====Carlton Banks====<br/>+[[Image:Carlton lg.jpg|right|thumb|Carlton Banks.]]<br/>+The character of Carlton Banks, Will's pedantic and preppy cousin, was portrayed by [[Alfonso Ribeiro]]. Carlton is a firmly conservative [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], and proves both friend and foe for Will. His role model is talk show host [[Bryant Gumbel]], and his favorite musician (and, according to him, [[guardian angel]]) is [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]]. His favorite actor is [[William Shatner]], whom he annoys by making lame [[Star Trek]] jokes. Like [[Family Ties]] character [[Alex P. Keaton]], Carlton dresses in a preppy style, is obsessed with money, is fairly short (Ribeiro is 5ft 6.25in, or 168cm, a common subject of Will's jokes on the show), and does not enjoy the popular music of most people his age. In earlier seasons, he makes frequent reference to his [[virginity]] (which was by choice), and also plans to attend [[Princeton University|Princeton]] (Philip's alma mater).  In later seasons, these arcs are both resolved: Carlton does indeed lose his virginity, but is not initially admitted to Princeton--instead he first attends the (fictional) University of Los Angeles, where he briefly manages ULA's student store, the Peacock. In the 6th and last season, he finally gains transfer admission to Princeton and leaves for the East Coast in the series finale.<br/> <br/>-===Manitoba===<br/>-*[[Brandon University]] &ndash; ''[[The Quill (newspaper)|The Quill]]''<br/>-*[[University of Manitoba]] &ndash; ''[[The Manitoban]]''<br/>-*[[St. Paul's College (Manitoba)|St. Paul's College]] &ndash; ''[[The Paulinian]]''<br/>-*[[Red River College]] &ndash; ''[[The Projektor]]''<br/>-*[[University of Winnipeg]] &ndash; ''[[The Uniter]]''<br/>+====Ashley Banks====<br/>+The character of Ashley Banks, Will's second-youngest cousin, was portrayed by [[Tatyana Ali]] (credited as Tatyana M. Ali).  Innocent and open-minded Ashley takes Will as a role model, to the chagrin of her parents, who want her to become a cultured and refined young lady.  Will's devil-may-care approach to life is an exciting alternative, which makes her generally more sympathetic and understanding towards him than other members of the Banks family.  Ashley matures through puberty in the series, becomes a [[one-hit wonder]] as a singer in her later teens, and briefly strives to become a fashion model.  In the final season she decides to attend a performing arts school in [[New York City|New York]], and in the series finale leaves with the rest of the family to live with her sister Hilary.<br/> <br/>-===New Brunswick=== <br/>-*[[Mount Allison University]] &ndash; ''[[The Argosy]]''<br/>-*[[University of New Brunswick]] &ndash; ''[[The Brunswickan]]''<br/>-**UNB Saint John &ndash; ''[[The Baron (newspaper)|The Baron]]''<br/>-*[[St. Thomas University (New Brunswick)|St. Thomas University]] &ndash; ''[[The Aquinian]]''<br/>+====Nicky Banks====<br/>+Nicky (Nicholas) Banks is born to Philip and Vivian in early 1993, towards the end of the 3rd season. The character was primarily used as a plot device, adding motivation for other characters, comic relief, or an emotional punch to the show's storylines.  As is common in television series, especially [[Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome|soap operas]], Nicky grows from newborn infant to pre-schooler between seasons, and confused characters on the show actually question how this came to be. After this "spurt," beginning in the 5th season, he was portrayed by [[Ross Bagley]].<br/> <br/>-===Newfoundland and Labrador===<br/>-*[[Memorial University of Newfoundland|Memorial University]] &ndash; ''[[The Muse]]''<br/>+====Geoffrey Barbara Butler====<br/>+The character of Geoffrey Butler, the Banks family's [[Great Britain|British]] [[butler]], was portrayed by [[Joseph Marcell]]. In addition to a long career working for British aristocrats, Geoffrey was an Olympic runner several years before being hired by the Banks family, but fled his home country in shame after cheating in a race.  He constantly refers to Will as "Master William," and is the voice of caustic humor on the show, often commenting on Philip's weight, his own low pay, his lack of a social or romantic life, the laziness of the family, and comic one-liners. He becomes the godfather of Nicky Banks (the son of Philip and Vivian) in the third season. Midway into the sixth season, Geoffrey discovers he has a son he never knew about, named Frederick and born to an ex-wife.  During the same episode it is also revealed that his middle name is "Barbara," which he explains is a "family name." He leaves to be with his son in London in the series finale.<br/> <br/>-===Northwest Territories=== <br/>-*[[Aurora College]] &ndash; ?<br/>+===Recurring Characters===<br/>+====Jazz====<br/>+The character of Jazz was portrayed by Will Smith's musical partner Jeffrey A. Townes, popularly known as [[DJ Jazzy Jeff|D.J. Jazzy Jeff]]. Jazz is Will's ill-mannered, not-so-bright best friend who lives in the inner-city community of [[Compton, California|Compton]]. He has a long crush on Hilary, and she ocassionally falls for him, but he eventually marries a prison inmate who had appeared on the television show ''[[Cops (TV series)|COPS]]''. He divorces her shortly afterward, realizing he knows nothing about her. Jazz is almost completely tactless, and succeeds in insulting or irritating Philip almost every time they are together. In a recurring gag throughout the series, Philip usually ends up literally throwing Jazz out of the house.<br/> <br/>-===Nova Scotia=== <br/>-*[[Acadia University]] &ndash; ''[[The Athenaeum]]''<br/>-*[[Cape Breton University]] &ndash; ''[[The Caper Times]]''<br/>-*[[Dalhousie University]] &ndash; ''[[The Dalhousie Gazette]]''<br/>-*[[Nova Scotia Agricultural College]] &ndash; ''[[Golden Ram]]''<br/>-*[[Saint Francis Xavier University|St. Francis Xavier University]] &ndash; ''[[The Xaverian Weekly]]''<br/>-*[[Saint Mary's University, Halifax|Saint Mary's University]] &ndash; ''[[The Journal (newspaper)|The Journal]]''<br/>+====Vy Smith====<br/>+Vy (Viola) Smith, portrayed by [[Vernee Watson-Johnson]], is Will's mother and Vivian's older sister.

The two fall deeply in love and are engaged to be married, going so far as the ceremonies twice, but never actually tie the knot. The first time they elope to [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] and try a ''[[Shaft (1971 film)|Shaft]]''-themed wedding, but walk out on the ceremony after realizing how much they wanted their families there. The second time Lisa leaves Will at the altar, just as they are about to say "I do" in front of all their friends and family, because she is having doubts.

As the manager of The Peacock, she was the object of Will's affection and frequent come-ons, but she continually spurned his advances, deeming him too immature. They were old childhood friends (and onetime lovers) from Philadelphia, except she felt Will hadn't grown up since those days. In the episode in which Carlton lost his virginity, Will mentions that he lost his own virginity just before he left Philadelphia. Since Jackie had already mentioned how she and Will had spent one night together before he left for Bel-Air, it is probably that Jackie was the first woman that Will slept with.<br/> <br/>-===Yukon===<br/>-*[[Yukon College]] &ndash; ?<br/>+====Kellogg "Cornflake" Lieberbaum====<br/>+''Kellogg Lieberbaum'' was portrayed by [[Michael Weiner (actor)|Michael Weiner]]. Most of his appearances were in the first season, but he did make one appearance in the second season. He was a classmate and friend of Will and Carlton at Bel-Air Academy. As a pun on [[Kellogg's]] [[Corn Flakes]], he is nicknamed "Cornflake" by Will. Much of the humor of his character came from the cognitive dissonance of an unassuming Jewish [[preppie]] using such phrases as "She is one fly sister" and "Say it loud, I'm black and I'm proud!"<br/>+\t\t\t<br/>+The last episode Kellogg "Cornflake" Liberbuam appeared in was "Those Were the Days" (Airdate: Feburary 24, 1992).

Eventually, Tom Jones guest-starred as himself and Carlton's guardian angel in one episode, showing Carlton what the Banks' family would be like if he never existed.<br/> <br/>-==[[United Kingdom]]==<br/>-===[[England]]===<br/>-*[[Brunel University]] &ndash; ''Le Nurb''<br/>-*[[University of Cambridge]] &ndash; ''[[The Cambridge Student]]''  (''TCS'') and ''[[Varsity (Cambridge)|Varsity]]''<br/>-*[[University of Durham]] &ndash; ''Palatinate''<br/>-*[[University of East Anglia]] &ndash; ''Concrete''<br/>-*[[University of Exeter]] &ndash; ''[[Exeposé]]''<br/>-*[[University of Hull]] &ndash; ''[[HullFire]]''<br/>-*[[Keele University]] &ndash; ''Concourse''<br/>-*[[London School of Economics]] &ndash; ''The Beaver''<br/>-*[[University of Oxford]] &ndash; ''[[The Oxford Student]]'' and ''[[Cherwell newspaper|Cherwell]]''<br/>-*[[University of Reading]] &ndash; ''[[Spark (University of Reading Newspaper)|Spark]]''<br/>-*[[University of Sheffield]] &ndash; ''The Steel Press''<br/>-*[[University of Warwick]] &ndash; ''[[The Warwick Boar]]''<br/>-*[[University of York]] &ndash; ''[[Nouse]]'' (pronounced Nooze, rhymes with [[River Ouse, Yorkshire|Ouse]]) and ''[[Vision (York)|Vision]]''<br/>-*[[University of Roehampton]]&ndash; ''Fresh''<br/>+* Carlton often impersonated the singer [[Michael Jackson]], emulating his singing style and dance moves in several episodes.<br/> <br/>-===[[Northern Ireland]]===<br/>-===[[Scotland]]===<br/>-*[[University of Edinburgh]] &ndash; ''[[Student (newspaper)|Student]]''<br/>-*[[University of Glasgow]] &ndash; ''[[Glasgow University Guardian]]''<br/>-*[[University of St Andrews]] &ndash; ''[[The Saint]]''<br/>+* A favorite recurring gag throughout the series involved Will's best friend Jazz flying out the front door after saying something offensive to a member of the Banks family (usually Philip) and being physically thrown out by him or her. The main scene of Jazz flying through the front door was only filmed once (used in Season 1, Episode #2: "Bang the Drum, Ashley"), and was re-used each time.  For this reason, in episodes where he is thrown out the door, he is seen wearing the same shirt that was worn in Episode #2. (Once, Will was thrown out of the house in the same way, Phillip was also thrown out of the house this way during a dream sequence). In Season 2, Episode #9: "Cased up", there was a small twist on this gag when Jazz offends Phillip outside on the Banks' driveway then comments "You can't throw me out because I'm already outside!" Phillip then proceeded to pick him up and carry him over his shoulder and throws him INTO the house via the kitchen door.<br/> <br/>-===[[Wales]]===<br/>-*[[Cardiff University]] &ndash; ''[[gair rhydd]]''<br/>-*[[University of Wales, Aberystwyth]] - ''The Courier''<br/>-*[[University of Wales, Lampeter]] - ''1822''<br/>-*[[University of Wales, Swansea]] - ''[http://www.waterfrontonline.co.uk/issues/issue139/home/index.php The Waterfront]''<br/>+* Will would commonly break the [[fourth wall]] as part of a gag, such as describing a character named Omar as "The dude who be spinning me over his head during the opening credits", or by being confused by how Nicky aged several years over about three months. In this scene, Jazz accompanies Will in breaking the Wall by first asking if the same person was playing the mother, making refrence to Vivian's changing of actresses, then by seeing the older Nicky and saying "Man I'm going back to the street where things make sense."  In another episode, after Uncle Phil says "We're rich," Will tells the audience, "If we so rich, why we can't afford no ceilin'?" while the camera tilts up to show the studio lights and rafters. In another episode, Will fakes playing the saxophone while [[Branford Marsalis]] plays in the background. Will then quips how great it is to be working for [[NBC]]. In another episode, Philip is complaining to Will, until Will takes a television remote and "clicks off" Philip, and then asks the studio audience if they wished they could live on television like him, where such things are possible.<br/> <br/>-== [[United States of America]] ==<br/>-''Main article: [[:Category:United States student newspapers|List of United States student newspapers]]''<br/>-===[[Alabama]]===<br/>-*[[University of Alabama]] &ndash; ''[[The Crimson White]]''<br/>-*[[Auburn University]] &ndash; ''[[The Auburn Plainsman]]'' <br/>-*[[University of South Alabama]] &ndash; ''Vanguard''<br/>-*[[Troy University]] &ndash; ''Tropolitan''<br/>-*[[University of Montevallo]] &ndash; ''The Alabamian''<br/>+* The [[fourth wall]] is broken again in the first episode of season 4. The last episode of the previous season ended with Will moving back to Philadelphia with his mom, leaving viewers wondering if he'll ever return to Bel-Air. The opening of the next episode starts with Will working at a restaurant in Philly when an NBC executive walks in and asks Will to follow him outside. Will does, and is shown a piece of paper. The NBC executive says "What does this say?" Will says ''Fresh Prince of Bel-Air''. The exec says "That's right, Bel-Air!" and then proceeds to push Will in the van. And that is the simple explanation for how Will ends up moving back to Bel-Air. This was actually a tacked on cliffhanger ending as the series was originally to have ended following the fourth season.<br/> <br/>-===[[Alaska]]===<br/>-*[[University of Alaska Anchorage]] &ndash; ''The Northern Light''<br/>-*[[University of Alaska Fairbanks]] &ndash; ''The SunStar''<br/>-*[[University of Alaska Southeast]] &ndash; ''Whalesong''<br/>+* Both Will and Carlton break the [[fourth wall]] in a later episode.  Will meets his eventual girlfriend Lisa at ULA, and she poses as a psychopath obsessed with Will.  Lisa later reveals that Carlton and her were in cahoots.  As a result, Will told Carlton that Lisa was really insane and had to kill Lisa out of self-defense.  Carlton goes into a frenzied grief, running through all the set pieces (the house, the university, the cabin where Lisa entrapped Will, etc.) eventually meeting Will as the camera pans away from the set and into the audience.<br/> <br/>-===[[Arizona]]===<br/>-*[[University of Arizona]] &ndash; ''Arizona Daily Wildcat''<br/>-*[[Arizona State University]] &ndash; ''[[State Press]]'' (Online Web Portal uses the brand ''Web Devil'') <br/>-*[[Embry Riddle Aeronautical University]] &ndash; ''Horizons''<br/>-*[[Northern Arizona University]] &ndash; ''Lumberjack''<br/>+*A little into the first season an episode showed Will sitting on the couch singing the song "And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going" by [[Jennifer Holliday]]. In a later season in an episode entitled "The Script Formerly Known As..." Hilary and Will interview a juror that had been dismissed from one of  Uncle Phil's court cases. The two make him so angry that by the end of the show Will wanted his forgiveness so he turns on "And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going" by Jennifer Holliday and sings to Uncle Phil.<br/> <br/>-===[[Arkansas]]===<br/>-*[[University of Arkansas]] &ndash; ''The Arkansas Traveler''<br/>-*[[Arkansas State University]] &ndash; ''The Herald''<br/>-*[[Arkansas Tech University]] &ndash; ''Arka Tech''<br/>-*[[University of Central Arkansas]] &ndash; ''The Echo''<br/>+==Issues addressed==<br/>+[[Image:Fresh Prince 3.jpg|thumb|Season three box set]]<br/>+While the show addressed many serious issues, these episodes were often lauded as [[very special episode]]s.

His uncle (himself a former Civil Rights activist) was furious, and pointed out Will's frequently-mentioned belief in the philosophy of [[Malcolm X]].  "I heard the brother speak," Phil angrily informed his nephew.  <br/>+:*In a later episode, Will and one of his old school friends, Ice Tray, reminisce about how Ice Tray frequently had to save Will from [[bully|bullies]] who attacked him because he tried to be a good student.  When Vivian confronts Will about Ice-Tray's lack of drive in himself and challenges the assumption by Will that he and Ice-Tray are alike, Will mentions that Ice-Tray never had anyone to stick up for him, and by having Will's back kept Will from spiraling down the wrong path.  <br/>+:*In another episode, Will and Carlton try to join an all-black fraternity, but Carlton is singled out for being a "sell-out," because his family is wealthy and "acts white".<br/>+*In an episode where Will is shot in the back during an attempted robbery at a bank [[Automatic teller machine|ATM]] and then hospitalized, Carlton found himself pondering the idea of carrying a gun for self-defense. This leads to an emotional confrontation between the two.<br/>+*In another early episode, Will and Carlton are delivering a car to one of Phillip's friends, but are accused by the police of stealing it only because Will and Carlton are African Americans.<br/>+*The issue of absent fathers was touched upon when Will finally meets his father Lou (played by [[Ben Vereen]]) in one of the series' more emotional episodes.  When Will was still an infant, his jobless father had one day walked out to "get a pack of smokes" and just never came home.  Years later he returned now employed as a trucker but by then Will was going to college.  Phil and Vivian gave him the cold shoulder for abandoning Will and his mother, Phil going so far as to say to him accusingly "How dare you set foot in my house." Will tried to remain conciliatory towards his father since this was his chance of meeting him, but the episode concluded with Will having to confront his grief when his father abandons him a second time. Symbolically Will accepts the fact that his Uncle Phil is the closest thing to a dad that he has ever had.<br/>+*The issue of teenage pregnancy was brought up in one episode in which Ashley was curious about sex. Will and Carlton, determined to find a way to talk to Ashley about it, go down to the local pregnancy center and find out about the issues.<br/>+*The issue of interracial marriages is addressed in one episode where one of Vivian's sisters announces her engagement to a white man, which Will's mother at first has doubts about. The episode ends with a wedding scene.<br/>+*Drug use is addressed in an episode where Will, busy with finals, basketball, and his girlfriend, is having trouble staying awake. When one of Will's classmates gives him some [[amphetamines]] to help him stay up, Carlton takes the pills, which he presumes to be vitamin E pills. After Carlton's near-fatal overdose, Will confesses that although he never used the drugs, he is to blame for Carlton's using them.<br/>+*The issue of alcohol abuse is explored as well. While at a party, Will and a rival drink shots to see who can drink the most. When Will passes out from drinking so much, some bullies drop Will off at a graveyard and Will meets the other dead spirits who are stuck playing an eternal game of poker. While the poker sequence is shown humorously, the mood gets somber when a ghost child (who was with the other spirits) tells Will that he died when a drunk driver hit him.<br/> <br/>-===[[Colorado]]===<br/>-*[[Adams State College]] &ndash; ''The South Coloradan'' <br/>-*[[University of Colorado at Boulder]] &ndash; ''Campus Press'' <br/>-*[[University of Colorado at Denver]] &ndash; ''The Advocate'' <br/>-*[[Colorado State University]] &ndash; ''Rocky Mountain Collegian'' <br/>-*[[University of Denver]] &ndash; ''Clarion''<br/>-*[[Front Range Community College Westminster]] &ndash; ''The Front Page''<br/>+==DVD releases==<br/>+''The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air'' has been released on Region 1, 2 and 4 DVD.<br/> <br/>-===[[Connecticut]]===<br/>-*[[University of Connecticut]] &ndash; ''The Daily Campus'' <br/>-*[[Wesleyan University]] &ndash; ''The Wesleyan Argus'' <br/>-*[[Yale University]] &ndash; ''The [[Yale Daily News]]'' (daily), ''The [[Yale Herald]]'' (weekly)<br/>+In the US and Canada, [[Region 1]], the first season was released on [[February 8]] [[2005]].

Carlton also had a thing for Michael Jackson. The irony was that not only did the young Alfonso Ribeiro appear with Michael Jackson in a 1980s Pepsi ad, dressing similar to and dancing as well as the superstar in it, he also had his own starring role in a Broadway musical entitled ''The Tap Dance Kid'' when he was eight years old.

Antivirus programs such as [[Norton Antivirus]] treated Back Orifice, NetBus, and some other free RA tools as necessarily [[malware]] and deleted them. However, they treated commercial RA tools such as [[pcAnywhere]] and [[Windows Terminal Server]] as necessarily legitimate and did not so much as bring their presence to the user's attention.<br/>+<br/>+The distinction between a ''remote admin tool'' and a ''backdoor program'' lies in whether the user has the right to install it on the computer in question -- not in the brand of program or the amount paid for it. The AV vendors' lapse was not in treating Back Orifice and NetBus as malware (since ''most'' installs of these programs are illegitimate) but in treating ''every'' detected installation of Back Orifice as a case of malware and at the same time treating ''every'' installation of a commercial RA program as legitimate.

The enrollment at Penn State is over 84,000 students, placing it among the ten largest public universities in the [[United States]]. Penn State offers more than<br/>-160 majors and administers a $1.4&nbsp;billion ([[United States dollar|USD]]) endowment.<ref name="endowment" /><br/>-<br/>-==History==<br/>-<br/>-Penn State was founded as a degree-granting institution on [[February 22]], [[1855]] by act P.L. 46, No. 50 of the [[Pennsylvania General Assembly|General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]] as the Farmers' High School of Pennsylvania. [[Centre County, Pennsylvania|Centre County]] became the home of the new school when [[James Irvin]] of [[Bellefonte, Pennsylvania|Bellefonte]] donated 200 [[acres]] (809,000&nbsp;m²) of land&mdash;the first of 10,101 acres the University would eventually acquire. In [[1862]], the school's name was changed to The Agricultural College of Pennsylvania, and with the passage of the [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act|Morrill Land-Grant Act]], Pennsylvania selected the school in 1863 to be the state's sole land grant college. In the<br/>-following years, enrollment fell as the school tried to balance purely [[Agricultural science|agricultural studies]] with a more classic education, falling to 64 undergraduates in [[1875]], a year after the school's name changed once again to The Pennsylvania State College.<br/>-<br/>-[[George W. Atherton]] became president of the school in [[1882]], and worked to broaden the school's curriculum. Shortly after he introduced [[Engineering|engineering studies]], Penn State became one of the ten largest engineering schools in the nation.{{fact}} Atherton also expanded the [[liberal arts]] and agriculture programs, for which the school began receiving regular appropriations from the state in [[1887]]. Atherton is widely credited with saving Penn State from [[bankruptcy]]{{fact}}, and is still honored today by the name of a [[U.S. Route 322|major road]] in [[State College, Pennsylvania|State College]]. Penn State's [[Atherton Hall (Penn State)|Atherton Hall]], a well furnished and centrally located dormitory, is named not after George Atherton himself, but after his wife, Frances Washburn Atherton. His grave rests in front of [[Schwab Auditorium]] near [[Old Main (Pennsylvania State University)|Old Main]], and is marked by an engraved [[marble]] block resting in front of his statue.<br/>-<br/>-[[Image:Penn state old main summer.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Old Main (Pennsylvania State University)|Old Main]]]]<br/>-In the years that followed, Penn State grew significantly, becoming the state's largest sources of [[Bachelor's degree|baccalaureate degrees]] and reaching an enrollment of 5,000 in [[1936]]. Around that time, Commonwealth Campuses were started by President [[Ralph Hetzel]] to provide an alternative for [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era students who were economically unable to leave home to attend college.<br/>-<br/>-In [[1953]], President [[Milton Eisenhower]] changed the school's name to The Pennsylvania State University, and the University developed rapidly under his successor [[Eric Walker]]. Under Walker's leadership ([[1956]]-[[1970]],) the University acquired hundreds of acres of the surrounding land, and enrollment nearly tripled. Additionally, in [[1967]], the [[Hershey Medical Center]], a college of medicine and hospital, was established with a $50 million gift from the [[Hershey Trust Company]]. <br/>-<br/>-In the 1970s, The Pennsylvania State University became a [[state-related]] institution. As such, it now belongs to the [[Commonwealth System of Higher Education]], and is not part of the fully public [[Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education]].<br/>-<br/>-In recent years, Penn State's role as a leader in education in Pennsylvania has become well-defined. In [[1989]], the [[Pennsylvania College of Technology]] in [[Williamsport, Pennsylvania|Williamsport]] joined ranks with the University, and in [[1997]], so did the [[Dickinson School of Law]]. Currently, the University is the largest in Pennsylvania, and in [[2003]], it was credited with having the largest impact on the state economy of any organization, generating an economic effect of over $6 billion on a budget of $2.5 billion. To offset the lack of funding due to the limited growth in state appropriations to Penn State, the University has turned to seeking philanthropy. 2003 marked the end of the Grand Destiny campaign&mdash;a seven-year effort which raised over $1.3 billion for the University.<br/>-<br/>-==Ranking and reputation==<br/>-Pennsylvania State University was ranked #47 on U.

Paris and Madrid earned the top scores; a further evaluation process in early 2005 put Paris and London in a close race which only became tighter as the final vote approached.

Key points in the accusations were London 2012's abortive athlete incentive iniatiative and lobbying by British prime minister [[Tony Blair]].  These comments were essentially eliminated by IOC president [[Jacques Rogge]]'s public statement that the competition had been fair and no rules had been violated.  Another controversy erupted when an IOC member claimed that Madrid had been eliminated in the third round due to another member pressing the wrong button while voting; that member turned out to have abstained altogether in that round.<br/> <br/>-{{Boxboxtop|Music:}}<br/>-{{User:Cielomobile/User Musician}}<br/>-{{user band}}<br/>-{{User:William Pembroke/Userboxes/Treble}}<br/>-{{User:William Pembroke/Userboxes/Bass}}<br/>-{{User:The Dark Side/Original userboxes/Music3}}<br/>-{{user composition}}<br/>-{{user piano}}<br/>-{{user clarinet}}<br/>-{{user flute}}<br/>-{{user oboe}}<br/>-{{user saxophone}}<br/>-{{user Classical}}<br/>-{{User:UBX/artist-3|Chopin}}<br/>-{{User:UBX/artist-3|Beethoven}}<br/>-{{User:UBX/artist-3|Schumann}}<br/>-{{User:UBX/artist-3|Schubert}}<br/>-{{User:UBX/artist-3|Liszt}}<br/>-{{User anthems}}<br/>-{{user midi}}<br/>-{{User Phantom of the Opera}}<br/>-{{User Wicked}}<br/>-{{User:EVula/Userboxes/Les Mis}}<br/>-{{User film Score}}<br/>-{{Boxboxbottom}}<br/>-{{Boxboxtop|Mathematics:}}<br/>-{{user mathematician-3}}<br/>-{{User:N4nojohn/Userboxes/Polar Coordinate}}<br/>-{{User:Worthawholebean/Mathlete}}<br/>-{{User:The Raven's Apprentice/Userboxes/User Metric}}<br/>-{{User:N4nojohn/Userboxes/Problem Solving}}<br/>-{{Boxboxbottom}}<br/>-{{Boxboxtop|Science:}}<br/>-{{User:The Raven's Apprentice/Userboxes/User Astronomy}}<br/>-{{User:OhanaUnited/Userboxes/Protect_Environment}}<br/>-{{User:The Raven's Apprentice/Userboxes/User Chemistry}}<br/>-{{User:Snuffles72/Userbox/memorizedpt}}<br/>-{{User:The Raven's Apprentice/Userboxes/User Linguistics}}<br/>-{{User:The Raven's Apprentice/Userboxes/User Physics}}<br/>-{{User:Karlhahn/user celestial mechanics}}<br/>-{{User:The Raven's Apprentice/Userboxes/User Warm}}<br/>-{{Boxboxbottom}}<br/>-{{Boxboxtop|Life:}}<br/>+==Bidding process==<br/>+<!-- Right here should be an overview of a normal bidding process, and how this specific bid series followed (or deviated from) the normal process.

Paris also planned to build temporary venues for some sports that can be moved and re-used elsewhere after the Games (dubbed "pre-cycling").

Madrid had also organised several high-quality European and world championships. The bid gained resounding support among the city and national population and was helped with the support of former IOC president [[Juan Antonio Samaranch]], who was lobbying votes for the Madrid team.

The city has plentiful accommodation and one of the strongest aspects of the bid was the city's ability to market itself throughout the world. At the heart of the X was to be the 4,400 room Olympic Village which would have provided spacious rooms well above the IOC benchmark. The bid was dealt a setback when New York State refused to approve the construction of the [[West Side Stadium]] which was to be a main venue for the Olympics, and hampered the bid in the short-run.<ref name="BBC New York" /> However, the New York bid was revived with the utilization of a new stadium, [[Citi Field]], as the primary venue for athletics and the ceremonies.

Probably the most controversial move by London 2012 was its initiative to offer incentive packages for participating athletes (including free flights, economical accommodations, food and vouchers for long distance calling) and immediately after announcing it, London 2012 withdrew it.  This U-turn was probably a result of [[Jacques Rogge]], President of the IOC, raising concerns because it could have started a "bidding war" if not withdrawn.  Paris 2012 also claimed that the lobbying by [[Tony Blair]] would have broken IOC rules.  This was strongly denied by Downing Street.  Neverthless, allegations about underhand tactics continued to be made by certain members of the Paris 2012 delegation until on [[4 August]] [[2005]] Jacques Rogge eliminated any further controversies by a clearly worded statement: "I made it very clear that, in my opinion, the competition was fair.

He further postulated that if this had happened, Madrid would have beaten Paris in resulting run off ballot for second place, and gone on to beat London in the final round. However, [[Craig Reedie]], another IOC member, dismissed the claims, commenting that a claim that an unnamed member 'might' have done something which 'might' have brought about something else which 'might' have brought about a different result is 'the kind of tittle-tattle that happens after many an IOC vote'.<ref name="wrongh">{{cite news |publisher = News.com.au |accessdate = 2005-12-23 |url = http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,17649352-2,00.html |title = London Olympics 'a mistake' }}</ref><ref name="wrongi">{{cite news |publisher = BBC News |accessdate = 2005-12-23 |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/olympics_2012/4553116.stm |title =  'Voting error' gave London Games }}</ref><br/>+<br/>+At the end of December 2005, Lambis Nikolaou denied the claim: "All speculations regarding my role in the third round of candidate cities for 2012 are completely unfounded.

On the ''Piece of Mind'' album, a [[backward message]] was placed at the start of the track "Still Life" as a kind of internal joke.  Reverse this track, and you will hear drummer McBrain clearly saying "Hmm, Hmmm, what ho sed de t'ing wid de t'ree bonce. Don't meddle wid t'ings you don't understand",<ref name="Wall246">Wall, Mick (2001), p. 246.</ref> followed by a [[belch]].

Not only did Herbert refuse to allow the song to be called "Dune", he also refused to allow a spoken quotation from the book to appear as the track's intro.  Bass player [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]]'s request was met with a stern reply from the agent: "No.  Because [[Frank Herbert]] doesn't like rock bands, particularly heavy rock bands, and especially rock bands like Iron Maiden".<ref>Wall, Mick (2001), p. 244.</ref>  This statement was backed up with a legal threat, and eventually the song was renamed "[[To Tame a Land]]" and released in 1983.<!--end of references from 12 Wasted Years video--><br/>+<br/>+===Experimentation===<br/>+<!--references from Official Biography (see below)--><br/>+In 1988, the band tried a different approach for their seventh studio album, titled ''[[Seventh Son of a Seventh Son]]''. This was a [[concept album]] featuring a story about a mythical child who possessed [[Clairvoyance|clairvoyant]] powers based on the book ''[[Seventh Son]]'' by [[Orson Scott Card]]. [http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=2936]{{fact}}.<br/>+<br/>+For the first time, the band used keyboards on a recording (as opposed to guitar synths on the previous release). In the opinion of some critics, this produced a more accessible release.{{fact}} The band also headlined the annual ''[[Monsters of Rock]]'' Festival for the first time this year. The 1990 edition of the [[Guinness Book of Records]] contains the following entry:<br/>+<blockquote><br/>+"Largest PA system: On Aug 20th 1988 at the Castle Donington "Monsters of Rock" Festival a total of 360 Turbosound cabinets offering a potential 523[[watt|kW]] of programme power, formed the largest front-of-house PA. The average Sound Pressure Level at the mixing tower was 118[[decibel|dB]], peaking at a maximum of 124 dB during Iron Maiden's set. It took five days to set up the system."{{fact}}<br/>+</blockquote><br/>+To close off their first ten years of releasing singles, Iron Maiden released ''[[The First Ten Years]]'', a series of ten [[cd]]s and double [[12"|12" vinyls]]. Between [[February 24]] and [[April 28]] 1990, the individual parts were released one by one, and each contains two of Iron Maiden's singles, including the b-sides, along with a part of "Listen With Nicko!"<br/>+<br/>+===Decline===<br/>+For the first time in seven years, the band had a line-up change with the departure of guitarist/backing vocalist [[Adrian Smith]]. Former [[Gillan]] guitarist [[Janick Gers]] was chosen to replace Smith, and in 1990 they released the raw sounding album ''[[No Prayer for the Dying]]''. This album went back to the heavy style of the band. This album featured one last song co-penned by Adrian Smith with Bruce Dickinson, "Hooks in You", despite Smith's having not been involved in the band after ''Seventh Son of a Seventh Son''. Vocalist [[Bruce Dickinson]] also began experimenting with a raspier style of singing that was a marked departure from his trademark operatic style. Nonetheless, the band obtained their first (and to date, only) number one hit single "Bring Your Daughter to the Slaughter". It was released on [[December 24]], [[1990]], and was one of the first records to be released on several different formats with different B-sides, thus encouraging fans to buy several copies. The single holds the record for being the fastest release straight in to number one and straight out of the charts again over the following couple of weeks. The song was originally penned and recorded by Bruce Dickinson for the soundtrack to [[A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child]].{{cn}} <br/>+<br/>+Before the release of ''[[No Prayer for the Dying]]'', [[Bruce Dickinson]] officially launched a solo career alongside Iron Maiden, with Gers as guitarist. Dickinson performed a solo tour in 1991 before returning to the studio with Iron Maiden for the album ''[[Fear of the Dark (album)|Fear of the Dark]]''. Released in 1992, the album had several songs which were popular amongst fans, such as the title track and "Afraid to Shoot Strangers".{{cn}}<br/>+<br/>+In 1993 [[Bruce Dickinson]] left the band to further pursue his solo career.{{cn}} However, Bruce agreed to stay with the band for a farewell tour and two live albums{{cn}} (later re-released in one package). The first, ''[[A Real Live One]]'', featured songs from 1986 to 1992, and was released in March 1993. The second, ''[[A Real Dead One]]'', featured songs from 1975 to 1984, and was released after Bruce had left the band. He played his farewell show with Iron Maiden on [[August 28]], [[1993]]. The show was filmed, broadcast by the [[BBC]], and released on video under the name ''[[Raising Hell (VHS/DVD)|Raising Hell]]''. [[Magician]] [[Simon Drake]] performed grisly illusions on the performance, culminating in Dickinson's "death" in an [[Iron Maiden (torture device)|Iron Maiden]]. However, after Bruce's departure from the band there was a great deal of bad feeling toward him from the other band members.{{cn}}<br/>+<br/>+===Winds of change===<br/>+The band auditioned hundreds of vocalists, both unknown and famous (among them [[Doogie White]] of [[Rainbow (band)|Rainbow]]<ref>The Official Doogie White Webpage, ''"Biography & Bands"'', 2004, Doogie White's Official Website, reported at [http://web.archive.org/web/20041014225316/http://www.doogiewhite.com/biog.html Archive.org]; last accessed [[October 8]], [[2006]].</ref>), and even offered the position to [[James LaBrie]] of [[Dream Theater]] but he declined.{{cn}} They finally chose [[Blaze Bayley]] in 1994, formerly of [[Wolfsbane (band)|Wolfsbane]]. Bayley had an altogether different style to his predecessor, which received a mixed reception amongst fans. After a three year hiatus, Maiden returned in 1995 with the 70+ minute-long album ''[[The X Factor (album)|The X Factor]]''. The album was generally seen as having dark, brooding songs that seemed more melancholy and introspective than usual.{{cn}} Chief songwriter [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]] was going through serious personal problems at the time with the break-up of his marriage and the loss of his father and many feel the album's sound is a reflection of this.{{cn}} The 11-minute epic "Sign of the Cross", opening the album, is perhaps the stand-out track, and even Bayley's detractors tend to recognise it as a classic.{{cn}} The first concert supporting the new album took place on September 28, 1995 in [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]].<br/>+<br/>+The band spent most of 1996 on the road before returning to the studio for ''[[Virtual XI (album)|Virtual XI]]'' (1998).  The album contained few notable tracks, with only "The Clansman" and "Futureal" surviving on future tours, and chart positions were observably lower.{{cn}} One of the most criticized tracks was the single "The Angel and the Gambler", which was all that many people heard of the album before deciding not to buy it.{{cn}} ''[[Virtual XI]]'' failed to reach the one million mark in worldwide sales for the first time, and thus sounded Bayley's death knell.{{cn}}<br/>+<br/>+===Reunion===<br/>+[[Image:BluceD.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Bruce Dickinson'' left the band in 1993, before returning in 1999]]<br/>+In February 1999, Bayley left the band, apparently by mutual consent. The main reason for his departure was his inconsistent onstage performance - Blaze's voice was not up to the rigours of a full-on Maiden tour. At the same time, the band shocked their fans when they announced that both [[Bruce Dickinson]] and guitarist [[Adrian Smith]] were rejoining the band, which meant the classic 1980s lineup was back in place - plus [[Janick Gers]], who would remain. Iron Maiden now had three guitarists for the first time. A successful reunion tour followed.<br/>+<br/>+====The new millennium====<br/>+In 2000, a more progressive period began for the band when they released the 67 minute long album ''[[Brave New World (album)|Brave New World]]''. The songs were longer (with all but three of the ten tracks clocking in at over six minutes) and the lyrics spoke about both dark themes and social criticism. The band gained a new fan base when they began exploring the genre of [[progressive metal]] with their more classic sound, and the world tour that followed ended in January 2001 with a show at the famous [[Rock in Rio]] festival in Brazil, where Iron Maiden played to an impressive crowd of 250,000.<br/>+<br/>+The band continued with their progressive trend with ''[[Dance of Death (album)|Dance of Death]]'' released in 2003. All but two of the eleven tracks chime in at over five minutes, and nearly all have a recurrent theme of death, though not always in a dark manner.  While failing to reach Gold status in the United States, the album went platinum in several other countries and left no doubts that the band was still a force to be reckoned with. Both ''Brave New World'' and ''Dance of Death'' were named "Best Metal Album" of 2000 and 2003 respectively by Metal-Rules.com.<br/>+<br/>+In 2005, Iron Maiden announced a tour to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the release of their first album and the 30th anniversary of their formation. The band re-released the "Number of the Beast" single, which went straight to number three in the UK charts. The band hit the road to support the 2004 [[DVD]] entitled ''[[The Early Days]]'', in which the band celebrates the music mainly from its 1975-1983 period.<br/>+<br/>+<!--As of 01.08.05, this is verifiable on the Latest News section of the www.ironmaiden.com official site--><br/>+<!--If it's old news there's no point in being here, and if we're going to detail this tour, so we should detail their past tours too--><br/>+Iron Maiden toured the United States with a stint on the 10th anniversary [[Ozzfest]] tour, playing before [[Black Sabbath]] from [[July 15]] through [[August 20]], [[2005]].

It was preceded by the "[[The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg]]" single on August 14. The album was once again produced by Kevin Shirley, and is the longest Iron Maiden album to date.<br/>+<br/>+The band has also recorded four cover tracks for use as b-sides, the first time for over ten years. In an interview with the Greek Metal Hammer magazine, [[Adrian Smith]] revealed these to be [[ZZ Top]]'s "Tush", [[Deep Purple]]'s "Space Truckin'", [[Thin Lizzy]]'s "Angel of Death" and [[Focus (band)|Focus]]'s "Hocus Pocus", the latter featuring [[Nicko McBrain]] on vocal duties. However, none of these songs ended up as b-sides for the aforementioned single.<br/>+<br/>+The tour in support of the album started on October 4th in Hartford (Connecticut). The North American Leg includes 8 US shows and 3 Canada shows. Then Maiden will move to Japan to play 5 gigs, the first of them on October 25th at the legendary Nippon Budokan and finally they'll start the European leg in Aalborg on November 9th. The European leg will end with 2 nights at London's Earls Court.  Whilst Iron Maiden had announced as early as 2003 that they would be cutting back on the length of each tour, the forthcoming tour has been criticised for it missing out many areas usually visited by the band. In particular, the absence of any Eastern European dates (such as [[Poland]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Greece]]) despite a strong fan base existing there has been questioned. In addition other countries where Maiden traditionally are very successful ([[Germany]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]]) are host to only one or two gigs where usually in excess of five are played in each country respectively. Maiden have however announced extensive dates in the UK and [[Scandinavia]], the latter possibly a reward for the area's staggering support for the band on previous tours. Most of the European shows are sold out several months before such as the Scandinavian shows and both nights in Milan.<br/>+<br/>+Touring in [[South America]] and possibly [[Australia]] has still to be announced and it is expected to follow in early 2007. <br/>+<br/>+Anticipating the release, the official website released two songs in streaming audio on August 10 and 11. The album entered the UK charts at #4 and entered the US charts at #9, while making their best debut in [[India]] at #4 and #2 in Canada. This was also the highest chart position any hard rock or metal act has ever reached, let alone debuted in India.

They differed from earlier leftist movements that had been more oriented towards [[labour movement|labour]] activism, and instead adopted a broader definition of political activism commonly called [[social activism]]. The U.S. "New Left" is associated with college campus mass protest movements and radical leftists movements. The British "New Left" was an intellectually driven movement which attempted to correct the perceived errors of "[[Old Left]]" parties in the post-WWII period. The movements began to wind down in the 1970s, when activists either committed themselves to party projects, developed [[social justice]] organizations, moved into [[identity politics]] or [[alternative lifestyles]] or became politically inactive.<br/>+<br/>+==Origins==<br/>+<br/>+[[World War II]] severely hindered operations of established [[communism|Communist]] parties in the United States and Western Europe. [[Political repression]] such as the [[Second Red Scare|Red Scare]] restricted organizing and limited Communist recruitment in the immediate post-war period, particularly in the U.S. In Western Europe, [[social democracy|social-democratic]] parties nationalized [[National Health Service|health care]] and transportation services, co-opting key planks of pre-war Communist party platforms.<br/>+<br/>+The confused response of the [[Communist Party of the USA]] and the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] to the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] created a crisis of confidence in party decision making. Independent [[Marxism|Marxist]] intellectuals began to develop a more [[individualistic]] approach to leftist politics, which was opposed to the perceived bureaucratic and inflexible politics of the pre-war leftist parties. In Western Europe, these new developments occurred both inside and outside social democratic and Communist parties, contributing toward the development of [[eurocommunism]]. The New Left in the U.S. was primarily based on college campuses. The New Left in the United Kingdom emerged through the links between dissenting Communist Party intellectuals and campus groups.<br/>+<br/>+==The British New Left==<br/>+<br/>+As a result of [[Khrushchev]]'s [[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences|Secret Speech]] denouncing [[Stalin]] and the [[Hungarian Revolution, 1956|Soviet invasion of Hungary]] in 1956, many left the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB) for various [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] groupings or the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. <br/>+<br/>+The British New Left concentrated on the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] and [[global justice]]. Some within the British New Left joined the [[International Socialists]], which later became [[Socialist Workers Party (Britain)|Socialist Workers Party]] while others became involved with groups such as the [[International Marxist Group]]. Trotskyist [[Tariq Ali]], who played a role in some of the New Left protests of this era, documents his involvement in his book ''Street Fighting Years.''<br/>+<br/>+The Marxist historian [[E. P. Thompson]] established a dissenting journal within the CPGB called ''Reasoner''. Once expelled from the party, he began publishing the ''[[New Reasoner]]'' from 1957.  In 1960, this journal merged with the ''[[Universities and Left Review]]'' to form the ''[[New Left Review]]''. These journals attempted to synthesise a theoretical position of a [[Marxist revisionism|revisionist]], [[humanism|humanist]], [[socialist]] marxism, departing from [[orthodox Marxism|orthodox Marxist]] theory. This publishing effort made the ideas of culturally oriented theorists available to an undergraduate reading audience. The ''New Left Review'' popularised the [[Frankfurt School]], [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Louis Althusser]] and other forms of [[Marxism]]. Other periodicals like ''[[Socialist Register]]'', started in 1964, and ''[[Radical Philosophy]]'', started in 1972, have also been associated with New Left theory and published a range of important writings in this field.<br/>+<br/>+As the campus orientation of the American New Left became clear in the mid to late 1960s, the student sections of the British New Left began taking action in these areas. The [[London School of Economics]] became a key site of British student militancy (Hoch and Schoenbach, 1969). The influence of the May 1968 events in France were also felt strongly throughout the British New Left. The politics of the British New Left can be contrasted with [[Solidarity, UK]], which continued to focus primarily on industrial issues.<br/>+<br/>+==New Left in the United States==<br/>+In the United States, the "New Left" was the name loosely associated with liberal, sometimes radical, political movements that took place during the 1960s, primarily among college students.  The origin of the name can be traced to an open letter written in 1960 by [[sociologist]] [[C. Wright Mills]] entitled ''Letter to the New Left''.  Mills argued for a new [[left-wing politics|leftist]] ideology, moving away from the traditional ("[[Old Left]]") focus on [[Labor movement|labor]] issues, towards more personalized issues such as opposing [[alienation]], [[anomie]], [[authoritarianism]], and other ills of the modern affluent society. Put differently, Mills argued for a shift from traditional leftism, toward the values of the [[Counterculture]].<br/>+<br/>+The New Left opposed the prevailing authority structures in society, which it termed "The Establishment," and those who rejected this authority became known as "anti-Establishment."  The New Left did not seek to recruit industrial workers, but rather concentrated on a [[social activist]] approach to organization. Many in the New Left were convinced that they could be the source for a better kind of [[social revolution]]. <br/>+<br/>+Most New Left thinkers in the U.S., to varying degrees, were influenced by the [[Vietnam war]] and the [[Chinese Cultural Revolution]].  Like the British New Left, they also believed that the [[Secret Speech]] drew attention to problems with the Soviet Union, but unlike the British New Left, they did not turn to [[Trotskyism]] or [[social democracy]] as a result. Much of the U.S. New Left argued that since the Soviet Union could no longer be considered the world center for proletarian revolution, new revolutionary Communist thinkers had to be substituted in its place — [[Mao Zedong]], [[Ho Chi Minh]] and [[Fidel Castro]] were identified as key contributors to this new framework.<br/>+<br/>+Other elements of the U.S. New Left were [[anarchist]] and looked to [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialist]] traditions of American [[Radical Left|radicalism]], and investigated the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] and previous union militancy.  This group coalesced  around the historical journal ''Radical America'' and in grouplets.  American [[Autonomist Marxism]] was also a child of this stream the U.S. New Left, for instance in the thought of [[Harry Cleaver]].<br/>+<br/>+The U.S. New Left both influenced and drew inspiration from [[black radicalism]], particularly the [[Black Power]] movement and the more explicitly left-wing [[Black Panther Party]]. The Panthers in turn influenced other similar militant groups, like the [[Young Lords]], the [[Brown Berets]] and the [[American Indian Movement]]. <br/>+<br/>+===Students for a Democratic Society===<br/>+{{main|Students for a Democratic Society}}<br/>+The organization that really came to symbolize the core of the New Left was the [[Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS). In 1962 [[Tom Hayden]] wrote its founding document, the [[Port Huron Statement]], which issued a call for "participatory democracy" based on nonviolent civil disobedience.  The SDS marshalled anti-war, pro-civil rights and free speech concerns on campuses, and managed to bring together liberals and more revolutionary leftists. The SDS became the leading organization of the antiwar movement on college campuses during the [[Vietnam War]], and during the course of the war became increasingly [[militant]].  As opposition to the war grew stronger, the SDS became a nationally prominent political organization, but opposing the war became an overriding concern that overshadowed many of the original issues that had inspired SDS. <br/>+<br/>+In 1968 and 1969, as its radicalism reached a fever pitch, the SDS began to split under the strain of internal dissension and increasing turns toward [[Maoism]]. In this vein, along with adherents known as the [[New Communist Movement]], some extremist [[terrorism|terrorist]] splinter factions also emerged, such as the [[Weatherman (organization)|Weather Underground Organization]].<br/>+<br/>+==International movements of the New Left==<br/>+<br/>+The [[Prague Spring]] was legitimised by the Czech government as a reformist movement to revitalise [[Czechoslovak]] socialism.  The 1968 events in the Czech Republic were driven forward by [[industry|industrial]] [[workers]], and were explicitly theorized by active Czech unionists as a revolution for workers' control.<br/>+<br/>+The driving force of near-revolution in [[France]] in May 1968 were students inspired by the ideas of the [[Situationist International]], which in turn had been inspired by [[Socialisme ou Barbarie]].  Both of these French groups placed an emphasis on cultural production as a form of production.  Unlike the New Left, the sphere of culture was not unrelated to productivity.<br/>+<br/>+While the [[Autonomia]] in [[Italy]] have been called New Left, it is more appropriate to see them as a unique response to the failure of the Italian PCI and PSI to deal with the new Italian industrial working class in the 1950s.  The Autonomia was a result of traditional, industrially oriented, communism retheorising its ideology and methods.  Unlike most of the New Left, Autonomia had a strong blue-collar arm, active in regularly occupying factories.<br/>+<br/>+The [[Provos]] were a Dutch [[counter-culture|counter-cultural]] movement of mostly young people with anarchist influences.<br/>+<br/>+==Criticism of the legacy of the New Left==<br/>+As many of those who supported the New Left in the 1960s are now in charge of the institutions they once opposed, conservative opponents argue that their assumptions - which are sometimes described as [[politically correct]] [[multiculturalism]] - are now the establishment orthodoxy. In what has been described as the [[culture wars]] and [[science wars]], conservative critics of this orthodoxy such as [[Allan Bloom]] and [[Roger Scruton]] assert that New Left [[Radicalism|radical]] [[egalitarianism]] is motivated by [[anti-Western]] [[nihilism]].<br/>+<br/>+==Inspirations and formative influences on the New Left==<br/>+*[[Albert Camus]]<br/>+*[[Guy Debord]]<br/>+*[[Frantz Fanon]]<br/>+*[[Allen Ginsberg]]<br/>+*[[Che Guevera]]<br/>+*[[Ho Chi Minh]]<br/>+*[[R.D.

The term "architecture" refers to the logical structure of the system that must be implemented in order for the instruction set to perform [[computation]]. This logical structure usually comprises the memory, registers and their interactions with a [[central processing unit]].<br/>-<br/>-== Encoding ==<br/>-<br/>-Instructions have traditionally been encoded in [[binary]] words consisting of 32 [[bit|bits]], although recent trends increasingly suggest that they will be encoded in 64 bits. A bit is a one or a zero. For example, 1001110110110111111001100011101001100110101011 could be a valid computer instruction. Instructions usually have representations known as [[mnemonics]], such as MOV 100 X which are intelligible to human beings.<br/>-<br/>-== Interface == <br/>-<br/>-The Instruction Set Architecture tends to form the interface between computer hardware and software. The architecture is implemented in hardware using electrical circuitry with many [[transistor|transistors]] to obtain a system that is able to perform logical operations. Computer scientists create software programs known as [[compiler|compilers]] that are able to translate code in high level languages into sequences of instructions.<br/>-<br/>-== Types of Architecture ==<br/>-<br/>-There are two broad classifications of Instruction Set Architecture, Reduced Instruction Set Computing ([[RISC]]), and Complex Instruction Set Computing ([[CISC]]). Finer levels of differentiation usually take place at the level of [[Random Access Memory|memory]] interaction. Architectures may then be classified into load-store architecures, stack architectures and a variety of others.<br/>-<br/>-=== RISC Instruction Sets ===<br/>-<br/>-RISC instruction sets are also known as load-store architectures, and represent the minimal set of instructions on which a stack of software can be built. They load and store words in memory locations, perform the arithmetical operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on floating point numbers as well as integers. They perform the logical operations of AND, NOT, OR and others on data, and have the ability to make decisions based on the results of logical or arithmetical calculations. These decisions usually result in some form of branching.

The exclusion may also extend to products derived from animal carcasses, such as [[lard]], [[tallow]], [[gelatin]], [[rennet]] and [[cochineal]]. Some who follow the diet also choose to refrain from wearing products that involve the death of animals, such as [[leather]], [[silk]], [[feather]], and [[fur]]. It should be noted that although many vegetarians abstain from all animal by-products, others make exceptions in their diet and attire. Vegetarians may consume dairy products; a stricter diet is [[veganism]] and the strictest is [[fruitarianism]].<br/>+<br/>+[[Image:Vegetarian diet.jpg|thumb|260px|A selection of produce typical of a vegetarian diet.]]<br/>+<br/>+==History==<br/>+Vegetarianism has been common in the [[South Asia|Indian subcontinent]], since possibly the [[2nd millennium BC]] for [[spirituality|spiritual]] reasons, such as ''[[ahimsa]]'' ([[nonviolence]]) and reducing bad [[Karma|karmic]] influences. [[Jainism]], which claims between eight to ten million adherants, enjoins its followers to be vegetarian. Many [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monks have also historically practiced vegetarianism. In looking for parallels in [[Jew]]ish and [[Christianity|Christian]] antiquity for these practices, some Christian vegetarians feel a kinship with [[Nazirite]], Essenes and [[Ebionite]] practices.  <br/>+<br/>+Many Hindu scriptures advocate the diet. The secular literature of [[Tirukural]] in [[Tamil Nadu]], India, proclaimed over 2000 years ago: "Perceptive souls who have abandoned passion will not feed on flesh abandoned by life. How can he practise true compassion, he who eats the flesh of an animal to fatten his own flesh?" {{ref|Kural}}<br/>+<br/>+Vegetarians in [[Europe]] used to be called "[[Pythagoreans]]" {{ref|Spencer}}, after the philosopher [[Pythagoras]] and his followers, who abstained from meat in the [[6th century BC]].

According to the Roman poet [[Ovid]], [[Pythagoras]] said: "As long as Man continues to be the ruthless destroyer of lower living beings he will never know [[health]] or [[peace]]. For as long as men massacre animals, they will kill each other. Indeed, he who sows the seed of murder and pain cannot reap joy and love." {{ref|WynneTyson}}<br/>+<br/>+In [[1847]], the first [[Vegetarian Society]] in [[Ramsgate]], [[England]], agreed that a "vegetarian" &mdash; from the Latin ''uegetus'' "lively", and suggestive of the English word "vegetable" &mdash; was a person who refuses to consume flesh of any kind.<br/>+<br/>+Seventh-Day Adventists and Rastafarians, denominations founded in the 19th and 20 century, are also frequently vegetarian.  African Hebrew Israelites only eat an organic vegetarian diet that also excludes dairy products such as milk.<br/>+<br/>+==Recent trends==<br/>+<br/>+Indian vegetarians, primarily lacto-vegetarians, are estimated to make up more than 70% of the world's vegetarians. They make up 20 to 30% of the population in India, while occasional meat-eaters make up another 30%. {{ref|Indian_diet_patterns}} Most Asian countries had a predominantly vegetarian diet until the past few decades, when increasing industrialization and westernization changed that. Perhaps the most famous vegetarian group is the [[Hunza]]s that reside near the [[Himalaya]]s in Pakistan, Afghanistan, China and India.  These people usually live to be over a 100 years old and have an exclusively vegetarian diet.<br/>+<br/>+In the [[Western world]], the popularity of vegetarianism steadily grew over the [[20th century]] as a result of nutritional, ethical, and more recently, [[environmental movement|environmental]] concerns. In the U.S., as of 2000, 2.5 to 3% said they never eat meat [http://www.vrg.org/journal/vj2000may/2000maypoll.htm], which may mean they are vegetarian, while 5 to 6% said they do not eat meat [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FDE/is_3_22/ai_106422316]. This represents an increase over the last decade [http://www.vrg.org/nutshell/poll.htm] and a great increase since 1950 when vegetarianism was very rare, although per-capita meat consumption has increased considerably since then, as the price of meat has fallen due to [[factory farming]], and the average income has risen.<br/>+<br/>+==Terminology and varieties of vegetarianism==<br/>+Different practices of vegetarianism include: <br/>+<br/>+* [[Lacto vegetarianism]] &mdash; Lacto vegetarians do not eat meat or eggs, but may consume dairy products. Most vegetarians in India and those in the classical Mediterranean lands, such as Pythagoreans, are or were lacto vegetarian. <br/>+<br/>+* [[Lacto-ovo vegetarianism]] &mdash; Lacto-ovo vegetarians do not eat meat, but may consume dairy products and eggs. This is currently the most common variety in the Western world.<br/>+<br/>+* [[Ovo vegetarianism]] &mdash; Ovo vegetarians do not eat meat or dairy products, but may eat eggs. <br/>+<br/>+* [[Veganism]] &mdash; Those who avoid eating any animal products, including eggs, milk, cheese, and sometimes honey, are known as dietary vegans. Those who avoid eating or using animal products, such as leather and some cosmetics, are called vegans.<br/>+<br/>+The following are less common practices of vegetarianism:<br/>+<br/>+* [[Raw food diet]] &mdash; Involves food, usually vegan, which is not heated above 116°F (46.7°C); it may be warmed slightly or raw, but never cooked. Raw foodists argue that cooking destroys enzymes and/or portions of each nutrient. However, some raw foodists believe certain foods become more bio-available when warmed slightly as the process softens them, which more than negates the destruction of nutrients and enzymes. Other raw foodists, called "living foodists", activate the enzymes through soaking the food in water a while before consumption. Some spiritual raw foodists are also [[Fruitarianism|fruitarians]] and many eat only [[organic food]]s.<br/>+<br/>+* [[Macrobiotic diet]] &mdash; Involves a diet consisting mostly of [[whole grain]]s and [[bean]]s, and is usually spiritually based like fruitarianism.<br/>+<br/>+* [[Natural Hygiene]] &mdash; Involves a diet principally of raw vegan foods.<br/>+<br/>+* [[Fruitarianism]] &mdash; Fruitarians, or fructarians, eat only fruit, nuts, seeds, and other plant matter that can be gathered without harming the plant (some fruitarians eat only plant matter that has already fallen off the plant). This typically arises out of a holistic philosophy.  Thus, a fruitarian will eat beans, tomatoes, cucumbers, pumpkins, and the like, but will refuse to eat potatoes or spinach. It is disputed whether it is possible to avoid [[malnutrition]] with a fruitarian diet, which is rarer than other types of vegetarian or vegan diet.<br/>+<br/>+The following similarly named diets are not considered full vegetarianism:<br/>+<br/>+* [[Pesco/pollo vegetarianism|Semi-vegetarianism]] ("pesco" or "pesco/pollo") &mdash; Some people choose to avoid certain types of meat for many of the same reasons that others choose vegetarianism: health, ethical beliefs, etc. For example, some people will not eat "red meat" (mammal meat &ndash; beef, lamb, pork, etc.) while still consuming poultry and seafood. It may also be used as an interim diet by individuals who are on a path to becoming fully vegetarian.<br/>+<br/>+* [[Flexitarianism]] &mdash; Flexitarians adhere to a diet that is mostly vegetarian but occasionally consume meat. Some, for instance, may regard the suffering of animals in [[factory farm]] conditions as their sole reason for avoiding meat or meat-based foods, and will eat meat or meat products from animals raised under more humane conditions or hunted in the wild.<br/>+<br/>+* [[Freeganism]] &mdash; Freegans practice a lifestyle based on concerns about the exploitation of animals, the earth, and human beings in the production of consumer goods. Many tend towards veganism but this is not an inherent practice. Those that eat meat generally support the arguments for vegetarianism, but as freegans are very concerned about waste many prefer to make use of discarded commodities than to allow them to go to waste and consume landfill space. [http://freegan.info]<br/>+<br/>+==Motivation==<br/>+===Religious===<br/>+{{main|Vegetarianism and religion}}<br/>+The majority of the world's vegetarians, according to the [[Society of Ethical and Religious Vegetarians]], follow the practice for religious reasons. Many religions, including [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Taoism]], the [[Bahá'í Faith]], [[Sikhism]], and especially [[Jainism]], teach that ideally life should always be valued and not willfully destroyed for unnecessary human gratification. Smaller denominations that prescribe the diet include the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], Rastafarianism and [[Sufism]]. <br/>+<br/>+[[Hinduism]] and [[Jainism]] both hold vegetarianism as the ideal. They believe that food shapes the personality, mood and mind. Meat is said to promote aggressiveness and a mental state of turmoil known as "[[Rajas]]" while a vegetarian diet is considered to promote [[Satvic]] qualities, calm the mind, and be essential for spiritual progress. They believe that animals have souls (a manifestation of the eternal [[monist]]ic consciousness [[Brahman]]) and killing animals have [[karma|karmic]] repurcussions that are bound to be reaped later by oneself. Also, the principle of [[Ahimsa]] (non-violence) compels one to refrain from injuring any living creature, physically, mentally or emotionally. Most of the secular motivations for vegetarianism such as ethical considerations and nutrition apply to Hindu & Jain motivations as well.<br/>+<br/>+Chinese [[Mahayana]] Buddhism strongly denounced meat eating and their monks are vegetarian. Tibetan, majority of Japanese Mahayana and Theravadan Buddists, on the other hand, do not believe that a vegetarian diet is essential to their practice.<br/>+<br/>+[[Jews]], [[Christians]], and [[Muslim]]s are left with the biblical ideal of the [[Garden of Eden]] diet, which from all appearances is [[fruitarian]]. However, only a relative minority within these religions practice such diets, since the book of [[Genesis]] later gives permission to [[Noah]] to consume animal flesh further citing that God gave [[Adam and Eve]] dominion over them.<br/>+<br/>+===Nutritional===<br/>+{{main|Vegetarian nutrition}}<br/>+[[Image:Fruit.jpg|thumb|right|260px|A small selection of vegetarian foods]]<br/>+Most [[nutrition]]ists claim that a diet rich in fresh fruit and vegetables but low in animal fat and red meat offers numerous health benefits, including a significantly lower risk of [[coronary heart disease|heart disease]], [[cancer]], [[renal failure]] and [[stroke]].<br/>+The [[American Dietetic Association]], the largest organization of nutrition professionals <!--largest in US or the world?-->, states on its website "Vegetarian diets offer a number of nutritional benefits, including lower levels of [[saturated fat]], [[cholesterol]], and animal protein as well as higher levels of carbohydrates, [[fiber]], [[magnesium]], [[potassium]], [[folate]], and [[antioxidants]] such as [[vitamins]] C and E and [[phytochemicals]]. Vegetarians have been reported to have lower [[Body mass index|body mass indice]]s than nonvegetarians, as well as lower rates of death from [[ischemic heart disease]]; vegetarians also show lower blood cholesterol levels; lower [[blood pressure]]; and lower rates of [[hypertension]], type 2 diabetes, and [[prostate]] and [[colon]] [[cancer]]." [http://www.eatright.org/Public/GovernmentAffairs/92_17084.cfm] [http://www.mayoclinic.com/invoke.cfm?id=HQ01596] The [[American Heart Association]]'s website states "Many studies have shown that vegetarians seem to have a lower risk of obesity, [[coronary heart disease]] (which causes heart attack), high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus and some forms of cancer." [http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4777] [http://www.organicconsumers.org/toxic/breastpest.cfm Studies] show that a vegetarian mother's [[breast milk]] has significantly lower levels of [[pesticide]] residue than a non-vegetarian's.<br/>+<br/>+Some vegetable protein sources lack in one or more "essential" amino acid.  For example, <br/>+Grains and nuts are low in lysine and legumes are low in methionine.  While everyone should eat a variety of foods to ensure a balanced nutrition, the body’s requirement for essential amino acids now appears to be much less important than researchers once believed.  Vegetarians get all the protein and [[amino acid]]s they need from eating a normal variety of [[whole grains]] (whole [[wheat]] [[bread]], [[oatmeal]], [[brown rice]]), [[beans]], [[nuts]], and [[soy]] ([[tofu]], veggie [[burgers]]/[[hotdog]]s, [[edamame]], etc). The intake of such foods has to be larger since the protein percentage in these foods are comparatively lower than in a similar serving of meat. Attaining sufficient protein intake is rarely a problem in [[developed countries]] and the lower protein intake of vegetarians has even been suggested as a possible cause of some of the health benefits above. A vegetarian diet does not include [[fish]] - a major source of [[Omega 3]], though some plant-based sources of it exist such as [[soy]], [[hempseed]], [[pumpkin]] seeds, [[canola oil]] and, especially, [[walnuts]] and [[flaxseed]].<br/>+<br/>+Some suggest that vegetarians have higher rates of deficiencies in those nutrients which are found in high concentrations in meat. Surprisingly, studies endorsed by the ADA found that this was not the case for [[iron]] or [[calcium]]. On the other hand, [[Vitamin B-12]] and [[zinc]] from vegetarian sources other than dairy products and eggs are not readily absorbed by the body and a vegan diet usually needs supplements.  [http://www.cyberparent.com/nutrition/vegandiet.htm]. Nonetheless, these nutrients are now commonly supplemented in milks and cereals in the western world, and is not necessarily a problem in a vegetarian diet.<br/>+<br/>+===Ethical===<br/>+[[Image:TIME Vegie.jpg|right|thumb|[http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101020715/story.html Cover Story] on [[TIME]]]]<br/>+{{main|Ethics of vegetarianism}}<br/>+Many vegetarians consider the [[factory farming|production]], subsequent [[slaughterhouse|slaughtering]] and consumption of meat or animal products as [[ethics|unethical]]. Reasons for believing this are varied, and may include a belief in [[animal rights]], or an aversion to inflicting [[pain]] or harm on other [[life|living]] creatures. In developed countries, ethical vegetarianism has become popular particularly after the spread of [[factory farming]], which has reduced the sense of [[husbandry]] that used to exist in farming and led to animals being treated as commodities. Many believe that the treatment which animals undergo in the production of meat and animal products obliges them to never eat meat or use animal products.<br/>+<br/>+===Environmental===<br/>+{{main|Environmental vegetarianism}}<br/>+<br/>+Environmental vegetarianism is the belief that the production of meat and animal products at current and likely future levels is [[environmentalism|environmentally]] [[sustainable development|unsustainable]]. Industrialization has lead to intensive farming practices and diets high in animal protein, primarily in first world countries and mainly the United States. According to the [[National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS) "Most of the world's population today subsists on vegetarian or near-vegetarian diets for reasons that are economic, philosophical, religious, cultural, or ecological." [http://www.nap.edu/books/0309039940/html/41.html]<br/>+Thus, the main protest of environmental vegetarians is primarily of intensive farming in first world countries.<br/>+<br/>+According to the [[United Nations Population Fund]] "Each U.S. citizen consumes an average of 260 lbs. of meat per year, the world's highest rate. That is about 1.5 times the industrial world average, three times the East Asian average, and 40 times the average in Bangladesh." [http://www.unfpa.org/6billion/ccmc/u.s.scorecard.html] As well "The ecological footprint of an average person in a high-income country is about six times bigger than that of someone in a low-income country, and many more times bigger than in the least-developed countries." [http://www.unfpa.org/swp/2004/english/ch3/]<br/>+<br/>+All modern, intensive farming practices consume heavy amounts of fossil fuel and water resources and have lead to emissions of harmful gases and chemicals. As well, they consume heavy amounts of fossil fuel and water resources and  destroying far greater areas of habitat (large industrial [[monoculture]] corn and soy fields, etc.) than is found in more sustainable farming practices such as [[organic farming]], [[permaculture]], [[arable]], [[pastoral]], and rainfed agriculture. <br/>+<br/>+Animals fed on grain, and also those which rely on grazing, need far more water than grain crops [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3559542.stm]. According to the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] growing the crops necessary to feed farmed animals requires nearly half of the United State's water supply and 80 percent of it's agricultural land. As well animals raised for food in the U.S. consume 90 percent of the soy crop, 80 percent of the corn crop, and a total of 70 percent of it's grain. [http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/sb973/sb973.pdf]. In tracking food animal production from the feed trough to the dinner table, the inefficiencies of meat, milk and egg production range from 4:1 energy input to protein output ratio up to 54:1. [http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/Aug97/livestock.hrs.html] The result is that producing animal based food is typically much less efficient than the harvesting of grains, vegetables, legumes, seeds and fruits.<br/>+<br/>+Environmental vegetarianism can be compared with [[economic vegetarianism]]. An economic vegetarian is someone who practices vegetarianism from either the philosophical viewpoint concerning issues such as public health and curbing world starvation, the belief that the consumption of meat is economically unsound, part of a conscious simple living strategy or just out of necessity. According to the WorldWatch Institute "Massive reductions in meat consumption in industrial nations will ease the health care burden while improving public health; declining livestock herds will take pressure off of rangelands and grainlands, allowing the agricultural resource base to rejuvenate. As populations grow, lowering meat consumption worldwide will allow more efficient use of declining per capita land and water resources, while at the same time making grain more affordable to the world's chronically hungry." [https://www.worldwatch.org/press/news/1998/07/02]<br/>+<br/>+===Social===<br/>+Some people are vegetarian because they were [[parenting|raised]] in a vegetarian household. Others may have become vegetarians because of a vegetarian [[partner]], [[family]] member, or [[friend]]. Some people live in a predominantly vegetarian society  (such as [[India]]), and so adopt this practice to avoid ostracism, or for the difficulty of buying meat in such a society <!--source?-->.<br/>+<br/>+===Spiritual===<br/>+Many [[Eastern world|Eastern]] religions claim that [[spirituality|spiritual]] awareness and experiences are greatly enhanced on a vegetarian diet. They believe that vegetarianism helps an individual to explore deeper levels of [[consciousness]] and establish a connection with the Divine, through such practices as [[meditation]], [[yoga]] or [[Sufi whirling|whirling]]. In the Western world there are also individuals like [[James Redfield]] who, independent from any specific religious beliefs, share the same sentiment. In the West this motivation is regarded by many as a [[New Age]] reason for being vegetarian.<br/>+<br/>+===Physiological===<br/>+There is considerable debate over whether humans are [[human physiology|physiologically]] better suited to a [[herbivore]] or [[omnivore]] diet.  Some, such as [[Albert Einstein]], regard an evolution to a vegetarian diet as part of our [[human evolution]], with each new generation moving slowly away from the necessity of eating meat.  Others study statistical information, such as comparing life expectancy with regional areas and local diets. For example, [[eskimo]]s whose [[carnivore]] diet consists of only [[Pinniped|seal]] meat and fish have one of the lowest life expectancies on Earth [http://www.energygrid.com/health/2004/05ap-atkins.html] (cancer is one of the highest causes of death, although this could equally be due to the harsh climate in which they live), while the Chinese whose diet is basically semi-vegan have some of the oldest living people in the world [http://www.chinahand.com/qigong/ckhistory.htm].  Other examples include looking within countries themselves.  For instance, life expectancy is considerably greater in southern [[France]] where a semi-vegetarian Mediterranean diet is common (fresh fruit, vegetables, olive oil, goats cheese and fish), than northern France where an omnivore diet is more common (also including pork, beef, butter, cows cheese and cream) [http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/04/050425111008.htm] [http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/bmj;330/7498/991]. Although it must be noted that many other influences come into life expectancy, such as clean water, sunshine, pollution, genetics and lifestyle (alcohol, smoking, stress etc), so it is difficult to provide conclusive proof of a link between regional diets and life expectancy. It is also worth pointing out that these comparisons assume food is available and there is no malnutrition, which is an overriding life expectancy influence in parts of the developing world for instance.<br/>+<br/>+Some vegetarian beliefs (such as [[Hare Krishna]] and Modern [[Buddhism]]) suggest that human beings are "[[Intelligent design|designed]]" to consume vegetable matter rather than meat. The reasons are mainly associated with the differences between predators and plant-eating animals.<br/>+<br/>+Predators usually have sharp teeth to tear fresh meat. Dogs, cats or lions are examples, while plant-eating animals have no sharp teeth to tear meat. Horse, deer, sheep and  human beings have no sharp teeth to consume meat.<br/>+<br/>+The intestines of predators are relatively short compared with those of plant-eating animals. This allows meat eaten by predators to pass more quickly though the intestines. Since meat rots much faster than vegetables, it is necessary for predators to have short intestines to prevent meat rotting inside the body that could harm the creature. Herbivores, however, need a much longer intestine to allow sufficient time for the digestion of vegetable fibres. Human kind could have the same digestive system with the plant-eating animals.<br/>+<br/>+According to The [[Straight Dope]], this is not actually factually correct. [http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a3_087.html] as humans have evolved to be omnivores. Human intestinal length is, taken as a ratio, half way between carnivores, like cats and dogs and herbivores like cows and horses.<br/>+<br/>+If there is a need for predator's intestines to be short enough to digest meat and excrete it as soon as possible before it is harmful(rotten) to the predators, any considerable longer intestine length could still harm the eater. Human digestive system may have evoluted to have shorter intestine than those herbivores as an alternative measures to reduce harmful effect from eating meat. As the food source for human become wider, human become less depend on the blind gut that digesting fibres. Those omnivores may be "forced" to consume meat(herbivores) or consume vegetables(predators) provided there was a food shortage. Consuming meat may harm the herbivores with long intestine length. Predators' short intestines may not capable to digest vegetables that need more time to digest. Any form of omnivores may be an alternative way to confront enivronment difficulties. Either shorter or longer intestine, would be well suit for either eating meat nor vegetables. There seems no mid-way in-between.  <br/>+<br/>+The way in which predators and plant eating mammals drink is another reason that is suggested. Predators like dogs, cats or lions use their tongue to drink water as digesting meat does not consume as much water compared with digesting vegetables. Plant-eating animals like horses, deer or sheep, suck water as do humans.<br/>+<br/>+Some Modern Buddhism proponents even hypothesize that human ancestry were ultimately vegetable eaters. During the [[Younger Dryas|last ice age]], much of human ancestry could not have survived by eating vegetables eclusively. As there was a lack of vegetables at that time, human beings would have had to change their diet (consume meat). The dead bodes of the large animals in the ice age that did not rot would have provided a stable food supply. This eating habit continued in humans after the ice age, as eating both meat and vegetables would have ensured a larger food supply.<br/>+<br/>+===Psychological===<br/>+<br/>+Many vegetarians choose to be so in part because they [[psychological]]ly find meat and meat products unappetizing. Proponents assert that human beings are instinctively attracted in an [[aesthetic]] sense neither to live or dead meat. For example, the carcass of a cow lying in a forest would attract a real carnivore like a wolf or leopard, but would disgust most human beings. If one gives a three-year-old child in a crib an apple and a live chicken, the child would instinctively play with the chicken and eat the apple, while the same apple and chicken is given to a young cat of equivalent maturity, it will play with the apple and eagerly kill and eat the chicken, all by itself. [http://www.wordwiz72.com/veg.html]<br/>+{{section-stub}}<br/>+<br/>+==Vegetarian cuisine==<br/>+{{main|Vegetarian cuisine}}<br/>+This generally means food which excludes ingredients under which an animal must have died, such as meat, meat broth, cheeses that use animal [[rennet]] (some vegetarians will eat all cheeses and others none, because of its milk content), [[gelatin]] (from animal [[skin]] and [[connective tissue]]), and for the strictest, even some sugars that are whitened with [[bone char]] (e.g. [[sugarcane|cane]] sugar, but not [[sugar beet|beet]] sugar) and [[alcohol]] clarified with [[gelatin]] or crushed [[shellfish]] and [[sturgeon]].<br/>+<br/>+==Country specific information==<br/>+* In [[India]] ''vegetarianism'' is usually synonymous with ''lacto'' vegetarianism, although ''lacto-ovo'' vegetarianism is practiced as well. 20 to 30% of Indians are estimated to be vegetarians and vegetarian restaurants (almost always lacto vegetarian) abound {{ref|India}}. There are usually many vegetarian (''Shakahari'' (~''plant-eater'') in Hindi) options available in all restaurants ('hidden' meat ingredients such as [[lard]], [[gelatin]], meat stock are not used in the traditional cuisine).<br/>+* In the [[United States]], ''vegetarianism'' is usually synonymous with ''ovo-lacto'' vegetarianism. However, vegetarians are sometimes wrongly assumed to be pesco/pollo vegetarians who will tolerate some meat. Many restaurants and caterers provide vegetarian options to patrons, often explicitly indicated as such. It is also possible to order a vegetarian meal and be served meat. Polls find that 2.8% of Americans are vegetarian as of [[2004]] [http://msnbc.msn.com/id/6008949/]. In addition, vegetarianism in the United States generally reflects regional cultural differences. It is more difficult to find vegetarian options in rural restaurants than in urban ones. The same applies to Midwestern city restaurants compared to West Coast restaurants. This seems to be slowly changing as vegetarian market innovations (such as veggie burgers) attain wider acceptance, demand, and distribution.<br/>+* In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], voluntary labelling of vegetarian foods is widespread, but far from universal. Many manufacturers will label food as "suitable for vegetarians" though there is currently no agreed definition of this. In addition, the Vegetarian Society operates a scheme where foods that meet its strict criteria can be labelled as "Vegetarian Society-approved". Cheese is often labelled as well, making it possible to identify cheeses that have been made with non-animal [[rennet]]. Flavourings in ingredients lists do not need to specify if they come from animal origin, which can make identifying vegetarian foods difficult if they are not otherwise labelled as such. 5% of the UK are estimated to be vegetarians. The [[United Kingdom|British]] Vegetarian Society regards a product as vegetarian if it is free of [[meat]], fowl, fish, [[shellfish]], meat or bone stock, animal or [[tallow|carcass fats]], [[gelatin]], [[aspic]], or any other ingredient resulting from slaughter, such as [[rennet]]. Where [[egg (food)|eggs]] are used, they must be [[free range]], and the product should not have involved [[animal testing]]. [http://www.vegsoc.org/business/corporate/symbintro.html]<br/>+* In [[Ireland]], food labelling is in place.<br/>+* In [[Spain]], most vegetarian meals will be served with egg, or even tuna. [[Stock (food)|Stock]] is normally used in vegetable soups and many sauces.<br/>+* In [[France]] the situation is similar to that in Spain, but is slightly less unfavourable.<br/>+* In [[Germany]], the confusion of vegetarianism with pesco/pollo vegetarianism is also common. There is no food labelling in place, and buying only vegetarian foods can involve having to read the fine printed ingredients list ("Zutaten") on many food products. However widespread [[Organic farming|Wholefood]] emporia provide sources for vegetarian foods in even remote areas.  <br/>+* In [[Australia]] the same conditions apply as in Germany. Some manufacturers who target the vegetarian market will label their foods, however except for foods intended for export to the [[United Kingdom]], this labelling can be inconsistent. Flavourings in ingredients lists do not need to specify if they come from animal origin. As such, ''natural flavour'' could be derived from either plant or animal sources.<br/>+<br/>+==Vegetarian societies==<br/>+Vegetarian societies (apart from India) were first formed in majority meat eating European countries both as a means to promote the diet and to gather together vegetarians for mutual support. By 2000, most western and developing nations had functioning vegetarian societies. The countries that were first to establish societies are still the ones most likely to have the greatest proportion of vegetarians within their populations.<br/>+<br/>+The first societies were:<br/>+*1847 &mdash; [[United Kingdom]]<br/>+*1850 &mdash; [[United States of America]] <br/>+*1867 &mdash; [[Germany]]<br/>+*1880 &mdash; [[France]]<br/>+*1886 &mdash; [[Australia]]<br/>+*1889 &mdash; [[India]]<br/>+*1890 &mdash; [[Ireland]]<br/>+*1893 &mdash; [[Switzerland]] <br/>+*1894 &mdash; [[Netherlands]] <br/>+*1895 &mdash; [[Sweden]] <br/>+*1896 &mdash; [[Denmark]]<br/>+*1896 &mdash; [[Hungary]] <br/>+*1899 &mdash; [[Belgium]] <br/>+*1900 &mdash; [[Austria]] <br/>+<br/>+The [[International Vegetarian Union]] [http://www.ivu.org/], a union of all the national societies, was founded in [[1908]].<br/>+<br/>+==Criticism==<br/>+There are some people who criticise vegetarianism on the grounds that it is difficult, if not impossible, to get a sufficient amount of [[B12]] from a strictly vegetarian diet [http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/reprint/78/1/3.pdf], although the American Dietetic Association and Dietitians of Canada statement on vegetarianism which has been reaffirmed four times over 15 years strongly disputes this [http://www.eatright.org/cps/rde/xchg/ada/hs.xsl/advocacy_933_ENU_HTML.htm]. Additionally, since B12 is produced in relatively copious amounts by bacteria in the human digestive system as well as organically cultivated soil, it is argued that only our recent age of obsessive cleanliness (in particular the excessive cleaning of vegetables) has made possible the potential for B12 deficiency in a vegan diet. In any case involving B12 deficiency, this can be easily remedied by simply taking a B12 supplement or eating common B12-fortified food products such as soymilk, breakfast cereal, or nutritional yeast.<br/>+<br/>+Some people have allegedly suffered from health problems because of various types of vegan diets [http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/reprint/156/10/1454.pdf]. However, many other people have suffered from health problems due to various types of non-vegan / non-vegetarian diets. For example, the [[World Health Organization]] indicates that [http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/publications/facts/cancer/en/ there is an possible but insufficient data] that eating animal fats increases your risk of cancer, and [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/oup/aje/2005/00000161/00000003/art00239 a study published in The American Journal of Epidemiology] in February 2005 finds that long term high intake of dairy and red meat may have "potentially adverse health consequences" in term of cardiovascular disease.<br/>+<br/>+Some question the assumption that food given to livestock could instead be used to feed humans. In developing countries particularly, such food is usually of poor quality and not fit for human consumption, though the land it utilizes could be turned over to human food production{{fact}}.  However, Cornell scientists have advised that the U.S. could feed 800 million people with grain that livestock eat [http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/Aug97/livestock.hrs.html] Also, there exist some types of terrain (such as mountains) that are suitable for grazing animals, but not suitable as farmland.<br/>+<br/>+Some people produce environmental criticism based on the water consumption of local farmers: In most of the poor countries in Asia, the main source of carbohydrates and intake of cereals comes from [[rice]] consumption. The cultivation of [[paddy]] requires two to four times as much water when compared to cultivation of other dry crops [http://www.fao.org/rice2004/en/pdf/renault.pdf (FAO)] thus making it far more environmentally friendly to diversify the production.<br/>+<br/>+Other criticism of vegetarianism comes from people who exclusively eat meat and dairy products produced locally in humane conditions.

Also, no offence to any contributors, but I think a lot of the prose as it is is poorly-written.  All the shuffling around has left a few holes... for example, a sentence in the third paragraph ends, "...sidelining Lowe's Seaborn", before any priot mention of Seaborn and the fact that she show was originally built around that character.

Well, uneducated people can not write an encyclopedia.  This is not prejudice, it's just a fact of reality.  We should be kind to people who are trying their best, of course.<br/>+<br/>+:The case that led to this conversation is a case of a contributor who is also rude and hostile and was breaking the rules of civility that we require of everyone.

As a result of discussion with a number of wikipedians I've created {{tl|fairusenoalternative}} and {{tl|Fairusereplace}}. Both make it clear that fair use depends on context and that all fair use should have a reason. One claims that we do not believe there is an alternative to the work for our needs, the other suggests that a free replacement is possible. The replace tag puts the images in a wanted replacement category.  I'm going to move forward and suggest that these tags completely replace the generic {{tl|fairuse}} and that we create similar fairuse tags to replace our other special area fairuse tags where it makes sense.  Although this doesn't create the broad prohibition on replaceable fair use works which some would favor in a new fair use policy, it does provide us with a good approach to reduce the  amount of unneeded fairuse in Wikipedia. I believe this will be broadly supported, so I'm not concerned about that. What I would like to know, however, is if this fits into your vision of increasing the clarity of license and freedom of the content in Wikipedia going  forward? --[[User:Gmaxwell|Gmaxwell]] 10:33, 18 September 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:I'm broadly supportive of fair use tagging improvements, and this sounds like a move in the right direction.

This is not current policy, and even I hesitate to push too far too fast in that direction.  But my very good friend Terry spends a lot of his spare time going to baseball games to take photos of baseball players for us, and he finds it disheartening that many of the photos he is taking aren't adding to wikipedia except in the narrow sense of improving things from a "fair use" to "GFDL" standpoint.  He's prefer to be known as the hero who went to baseball games year in and year out to get hundreds of photos for Wikipedia for article which would have otherwise been bare.<br/>+<br/>+:On the related issue of the image upload form, and the options people are given, I think perfectly valid options which should be on the list is "I do not know the source of this photo" and "I found it on another website".  Those will be CSD'd in a week if someone doesn't find a proper source and a proper fair use rationale.  I think we should be extremely (extremely!) paranoid about giving newcomers to the community any kind of incentive to lie to us about where they got a photo.

Doing so would require an act by the copyright holder, and may not be likely in many cases, but it is still possible. It is also what we hope to achieve. As Wikipedia grows and becomes more recognized the ease of getting such things to happen will increase and it's important to note that it's happened already: there have been many cases of people asking for license grants for material we'd otherwise have to use via fair use or not at all.

One of the things missed in the current new tags is the distinction I've provided for replacable images verses ones which likely can't be. For some catagories of fair use it's only going to be one way or the other, but in many cases it's not so. I think this is a critically important piece of information we need to tag up front and which should be a part of any dicussion about the fair use of an image. And if a list of images to be replaced isn't one of the outputs of our fair use endeavors, well, we might was well just go home. :) In any case, the tags to a great job of giving clear justifications (although I did have a problem with a user who assumed a strained reading of the magcover one), but they don't make it clear *where*..

Anyway, all that said I notice that a warning note about the new policy has been added to the top of the My Watchlist page, and I think that's an excellent idea.

SlimVirgin who had no history with the Terri Schiavo article, and with no discussion on the talk page, made a massive edit to the article (9 edits over the course of 3 hours, putting the "in use" tag up during that time). Several editors complained that such an edit was inappropriate for an article that was in mediation and marked as contoversial (and an experienced editor and admin should have known that), and that her edit contained numerous factual errors and contained biases violating NPOV. Ed remained silent on SlimVirgin's edit. However, when Neuroscientist posted an exceedingly detailed and neutral 5,000 word criticism of SlimVirgin's edit [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ATerri_Schiavo&diff=18726255&oldid=18719115], Ed Poor made a rare appearance on the talk page warning Neuroscientist about No Personal Attacks.

They should be encouraged constantly to present their problems in a constructive way". I've been trying to do that, and have reached the end of the dispute resolution process. Arbcom refuses to address any specifics around the Ed Poor case, and there is no step after arbitration for me to take. It also says "Anyone who just bitches without foundation ...  I must simply reject and ignore". I think the evidence I've submitted is sufficient foundation that Ed Poor broke some specific policies. It would seem to be a legitimate foundation, and I was asking arbcom to make the final decision as to whether policy was actually violated or not.<br/>+<br/>+Your "principles" page also mentions "a culture of thoughtful diplomatic honesty", "There must be no cabal, there must be no elites". I think that Ed Poor has acted as an elite, going so far as admitting he gets away with stuff because he's been around a long time. And arbcom's response appears to reinforce the image of a cabal, given that their handling of the Ed Poor case is unlike any other arbitration case I've seen, given that it was opened and closed in a single week before editors had submitted all evidence, given nothing in the case acknowledges even a single policy violation, and given how the members of arbcom have different explanations as to whether Ed plead guilty, whether guilt was simply "implied", or whether any violations were officially recognized at all.<br/>+<br/>+I've tried to be as diplomatic as I can around this issue, with no resolution.

The evidence I submitted is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Ed_Poor/Evidence#Evidence_presented_by_FuelWagon here]. It shows that Ed showed unacceptable behaviour as mediator and misuse of administrator priviledges once SlimVirgin began editing the article on July 11. As it happens, Ed Poor and SlimVirgin are both administrators who have worked together a long time and so it seems that Ed's friendship with SlimVirgin colored his actions as mediator on the Terri Schiavo article. Ed Poor "warned" [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Neuroscientist&diff=prev&oldid=18749442] user Neuroscientist about the possibility of violating NPA when all Neuroscientist had done was criticize the content of SlimVirgin's edit [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ATerri_Schiavo&diff=18726255&oldid=18719115].

(This is inserted as an example of a '''forbidden comment''', go ahead and complain about me if you want, but I was [[Wikipedia:illustrating a point|illustrating a point]].<br/>+<br/>+Ed's behaviour as mediator on the Terri Schiavo article was unacceptable. He defended his personal friend, SlimVirgin, to the point of attacking anyone who criticized her edits and misusing admin priveledges by blocking me for preparing an RfC against SlimVirgin. Several editors in good standing left wikipedia immediately following this fiasco, including Neuroscientist, Duckecho, and A Ghost. And their only crime was criticizing the content of SlimVirgin's edits. Had a neutral mediator been involved with the Terri Schiavo article, a lot of this would have been avoided, and these editors might still be making good contributions to wikipedia. However, Ed Poor was not neutral in any way around this incident, to the point of (1) warning an editor of possible NPA violations for criticizing SlimVirgin (2) misusing admin powers by blocking me for preparing an RfC against SlimVirgin (3) attacking the RfC against SlimVirgin and thereby attacking anyone who supported it and (4) attacking me personally. <br/>+<br/>+The arbitration case against Ed Poor has been closed without finding any facts about Ed Poor's behaviour. Arbcom accepted Ed's resignation as bureaucrat, but this incident involves Ed acting inappropriately as a mediator and misuing admin priveledges. <br/>+<br/>+Fred Bauder has said the request to reopen the case has been denied. So the only step left is to appeal to you. I do not want additional punishment against Ed Poor, but I do want a finding of fact on his actions. Arbcom closed the case against Ed Poor without making a single determination on his behaviour. I would like some sort of determination that would come out and say yes or no as to whether Ed acted inappropriately as a mediator and as to whether he misused his admin priviledges when he blocked me. <br/>+<br/>+It seems that arbcom has made a special case for Ed Poor here, specifically avoiding saying Ed did anything that was a violation of any specific policy. No other editor that I know of before arbcom has ever been treated this gingerly. Every other case has a finding of facts to determine whether someone's behaviour was acceptable or not. In the case of Ed Poor, the facts have been buried. Arbcom says that Ed "plead guilty", but in the real world, pleading guilty means you plead guilty of a specific and usually lesser crime in order to avoid prosecution of a greater crime. in this case, Ed plead guilty to nothing and offered up his bureaucratship in exchange for ''avoiding'' prosecution of any kind. Arbcom is completely silent on whether Ed violated any policy at all. Ed Poor has effectively been ''pardoned'', he resigned to avoid further prosecution. <br/>+<br/>+I don't ask for additional punishment, but I do ask that Ed's behaviour be judged, that a determination be made as to whether Ed's actions were appropriate for a mediator, whether his block was a misuse of admin priveledges, rather than leave it buried.<br/>+<br/>+Since the request to reopen the case has been denied, I appeal to you that the truth might not be buried.

I have noticed an unreasonable expectation that newcomers will be intimately familiar with Wikipedia ethics prior to making any edits.  This is of course contrary to the advertisement on the home page: "anyone can edit."  While standards are valuable, recrimination is not the way to improve anything, especially an information source that can easily be abused.  I would argue that editors who do not maintain a civil tone should be blocked from editing, just as should editors who vandalise the Wikipedia.  It is all well and good to speak the truth but, such truth need not be stated with contempt, much less ill will.  Further, it should be the goal of every editor to improve the editing skills of every other editor.  Quality of the Wikipedia ought be the most important goal.  The second most important goal ought be civility.  I ask not for political correctness.  Just kindness and patience.  [[User:William R. Buckley|William R.

These brothers then got Ph.Ds. on the basis of these publications of repudiated merit.  Now these same brothers want to author the article about this affair.  These Bogdanoff brothers and their supporters (and sock puppets) have done '''nothing''' else for Wikipedia other than action on this sole article.  I have been a Wikipedian for about 2 years working on a bunch of physics, electrical engineering, and audio signal processing articles.<br/>+<br/>+I have been was extremely NPOV when I started in this [[Bogdanov Affair]], but became convinced later, after much investigation, that these Bogdanov brothers are simply dishonest.  They lie about other people's positions.  They have taken criticism of their "work" and translated them into French as a praise and published the mistranslation on their books.  They have used sock puppets repeatedly.  They have threatened legal action against critics.  They clearly have something to gain or lose by the suppression or revelation of the factual content of the affair and are desperately trying to suppress it.  I simply want to include all of the factual content (most of which is not flattering to the Bogdanoffs).<br/>+<br/>+Can you help?  Many honest editors would greatly appreciate it.

Igor would be correct to imply that only the "specialists" can debate this effectively, but he is not correct that this is the salient question for debate about the Wikipedian article.  Wikipedia is not the ''Annals of Physics'' nor ''Classical and Quantum Gravity'' nor the USENET newsgroup ''sci.physics.research''.  it would be nice if we could get more real physicists other than [[User:YBM]] involved, but then again, Wikipedia is not the place for real physicists to slug out what is or is not real physics.<br/>+<br/>+:2.  the other question that is salient is: what does the wider community of physicists say about the quality and veracity of the Bogdanoff's work?  well, there is quite a record and, '''despite''' the publication of their earlier papers in reputable journals, the record is not flattering for the Bogdanoffs.  the VAST majority of the credentialed physics community has utterly rejected and dismissed their published work as "wrong", "hoax", "embarrassing", "incoherent", "gibberish", conceptully invalid (my paraphrase of many positions), and even "BS" (and i don't think they mean "Bachelor of Science").  VERY, VERY, FEW physicists have come to their defense on the record.  we virtually only hear the journal referee's comments (and only relayed to us via the Bogdanoff's, that has to be a dubious source) but that fails to recognize the problem.  no one disputes that the Bogdanoff's got published in a couple of legitimate journals of theoretical physics.  the problem is that their papers are believed '''by the mainstream''' to be without merit.  the journal referees competence regarding this arcane field are also suspect (indeed physicist [[John Baez]] has said that the referees have something to answer for).  and the merit that Bogdanoff's try to extract from such publication has been destroyed by the fact that the editorial board of CQG has made it clear that the papers, in retrospect, have failed to meet the standards expected of any article published in the journal.  the editors of CQG have repudiated the very papers that the Bogdanoffs have published in their journal.  this is undeniably damning (except that Igor does actually deny that it is).<br/>+<br/>+the Wikipedia policy is that there is no original research and neutral POV.  the fact that the Bogdanoffs continue to defend their work as genuine should be reported as such.  but the fact that their work is overwelmingly rejected by the mainstream physics community should also be reported as such.  including links to [[fringe science]], [[protoscience]], [[junk science]], and [[pseudoscience]] is not inappropriate at all, because there is no way that anyone can claim it to be in the [[mainstream]].

I'm sysop on Slovene Wikipedia and we have a problem regarding deletion on images, which don't have stated source and/or copyright tag. I'm trying to sort this problem for several months and with your new criterion (warning, 7 days, then deletion) on this would be everything easier. But several users on :sl (including some admins and bureaucrats) are opposing deletion of such activity, inspite that several pictures are almost 2 years old and uploader didn't nothing. 3 moths ago I started to work on this problem and immediatly I hit a wall. Several users stated that they have uploaded many photos and they couldn't check them all. So I went through all material and propaly taged them (if missing source, description, copyright tag). They they stated that this isn't good because there were only 3 large categories, so I asked Andre Engels to write a bot script to clear this. So the bot had sorted photos according to uploader to personal categories (this was completed almost 2 weeks ago). Some users used this to sort out (add missing info), but most didn't. So today I started with deletion of problem photos and immediatly they apposed this (even threated with de-sysoping). During this deleting today (I went through about 100 photos) I accidently delete also one properly taged photos because of bug problems on :sl WP. So I'm asking you if you could visit Slovene [[sl:Wikipedija:Pod_lipo|Village pump]] and add your comment on this (current discussion is [http://sl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedija:Pod_lipo#Brisanje_slik_z_nepopolnimi_podatki here]). Some of the opposers want another extend time-limit for deletion from some days or to 3 months. When I started with sorting of this problem almost half of all uploaded photos were missing some sort on info, so this could be a big legal problem.

Outside of Wikipedia, I contribute to the Flags of the World website. From there, many of "our" images on Wikipedia came from the FOTW website. (see http://groups.yahoo.com/group/flags/message/97681, if you cannot see it, I will give you the gist of it.) We, at FOTW, have a rule stating that our flag drawings can only be used for non-commercial purposes, [http://fotw.vexillum.com/flags/disclaim.html#cop] which has been illegal since May of this year. The images that Revolucion uploaded came from FOTW and did not credit FOTW for the images. Because of that, and based on the ear-ful messages I got at FOTW, I had to delete all of their images (I am in the process of doing that now) from here and also redrew some myself. And, really, because of the abuse of the flag images from FOTW and Flags.net (who I asked for permission before but I was not replied to), I had to change {{tl|PD-Flag}} to {{tl|Flagimage}}. While I know that this image use policy from FOTW was brought to Wikipedia by surprise, but if my guys over there are complaining about the images and want them gone, I have to get rid of it to honor their requests.

However, we have reported on some court hearings in the [[Terri Schiavo]] article, and, back on the 24th, I gave notice [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Terri_Schiavo&diff=23875813&oldid=23868416#Vanity_links:_Removed_per_User:GordonWatts here] that I was removing all "vanity" links -to pages where I was the editor -even though they seemed appropriate -because I didn't want to give the ''appearance'' of impropriety or "vanity promotion" -and since there were many other links that could be used in these categories.<br/>+<br/>+Indeed, [[Wikipedia:Vanity_page]] makes it quite clear that "The insertion of links that appear to promote otherwise obscure individuals by pointing to their personal pages...[are examples of] edits within non-Vanity articles that '''may''' be deemed as ''vanity edits.''"

Or shouldn't it be mainly democratic? ==<br/>+<br/>+My considerations are as follows: <br/>+<br/>+On WP votes to decide for example a ban are common. Voting is something required to democracy. But democracy is not simply just voting. I would not label a state democracy, where for example the majority would vote for holocaust. It is possible. Voting for holocaust is probably an extreme case, which is not probable (altough german voted in for Hitler). So a modern democracy has also some laws, some consistency of laws, some human rights in the constitution and so on. You can not vote in modern democracy for something, which contradicts the constitution. You can not vote on something, which contradicts another law. Moreover, you can not vote simply for executing a person. That is called [[lynching]]. You also can not ban minorities, or opposition. <br/>+All these things have a common term: "rightfullness". I think, and I have personal experiences with this, that WP without such warrants for rightfullness can not maintan NPOV, can not maintain tolerance, so it can not work properly.<br/>+<br/>+So I guees something is needed for warranting rightfullness, voting is not enough. We should take the good things from the system of a modern, democratic state, and put those good parts into WP. It is highly missed, I think.<br/>+<br/>+--[[User:Seingalt|Seingalt]] 11:43, 29 September 2005 (UTC) (am more active on the Hungarian WP)<br/>+<br/>+:I would say it's not, and in a way you've shown that yourself, by posting this question here, on Jimbo Wales's talk page. Ultimately, it seems that in the end arguments often come down to an appeal to Jimbo if nothing else works, and he decides based on his own judgement. He is therefore in the position of a president or head of state or perhaps supreme court judge, but not one that we actually voted in, or one we could ever vote out. That is in fact the definition of a dictator. In this case I hope a benign one. The image deletion debacle also shows that if Jimbo makes an error of judgement, there is not much of a mechanism in place to prevent its consequences before it's too late, and also shows there are any number of willing minions willing to carry out those decrees. This isn't to malign Jimbo, I don't know him personally nor have anything against him, but to my mind the situation isn't ultimately a very healthy one. [[User:GRAHAMUK|Graham]] 12:12, 29 September 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::Wikipedia most closely resembles a constitutional monarchy of the British sort, though of course it has homegrown institutions which are not precisely like the British ones.

There are personal rights, there is tolerance, there are laws inhibiting discrimination. Ond there is a system of consitency: you may not have inconsistent law system.

These parts of state are separated.<br/>+<br/>+I think that WP is firstly a project to create a lexicon, but actually it has to become something like a minimal democracy in order to function properly. I think WP is more like a state than a company. In a company the human resource maganer, and in the end the CEO may decide to contract somebody or ban somebody. If WP does this, than it is like a company, but then it is not a world-wide, free community.<br/>+<br/>+What I want to emphasize is if WP wants to become a free, world-wide community, which works efficiently on the encyclopedia, than it needs these "laws" warranting rightfullness, tolerancy and so on.

In my opinion, he has now special power, and authority. The metaphor with the English Queen is quite good. Ideally Jimbo shall use his power to kick off the project the best way he can. After a while the system should be some kind of complete enough. At this point Jimbo should suggest himself to limit his power (step down, or declare elections:). He may be an authority for a while, like the British Queen. But actually the ideal sytuation would be: "now the system works without me, I resign my power, let it function itself". --[[User:Seingalt|Seingalt]] 13:39, 29 September 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:I think Jimbo is well on his way to achieving just that.  Although vested with tremendous&ndash;heck, absolute&ndash;authority, he uses it very sparingly...and usually to do things that the community finds reasonable.  Up in Canada, we have a constitutional monarchy; technically our head of state is Queen Elizabeth II, with her authority vested in a local Governor General.  On paper, the GG has a tremendous amount of power&mdash;she can refuse to sign legislation, preventing the passage of laws; she is the commander-in-chief of our armed forces; she can dissolve Parliament and force an election (or refuse to dissolve Parliament, for that matter).<br/>+:In practice, the GG actually wields very little of that authority.  The GG acts on the advice of the elected Government and Prime Minister of the day; a Governor General hasn't acted against the wishes of the Prime Minister since the 1920s.  Many of the duties of the Governor General are ceremonial: goodwill tours, administering the [[Order of Canada]], that type of thing.  There has been very little interest in eliminating the office of the GG or removing the Queen as head of state.  Partly it's because amending a Constitution is a pain in the neck, but also it is because people are comfortable knowing that there is one individual who can act as a sanity check&ndash;a brake&ndash;on any sort of flaming idiocy a government might choose to enact.  The Governor General is sometimes described as the holder of the 'Constitutional fire extinguishers'.<br/>+:Right now, Jimbo interferes very little in the operation of Wikipedia.  Quasi-governmental and quasi-judicial bodies like the ArbCom take care of tasks that used to require solutions imposed from on high.  Jimbo now fills two roles that are very similar to those of the Canadian Governor General.  First, he is a public face for Wikipedia; he is seen as relatively non-partisan, uncontroversial, and&ndash;dare I say it?&ndash;popular.  While he leads the organization, he doesn't usually get involved in the dirty day-to-day business.   Second, he holds the fire extinguishers.  In those rare situations where ArbCom is unable to move sufficiently quickly to address a problem, or administrators and bureaucrats disagree on how to cope with a situation, or there is an issue that puts the project in jeopardy (legal or otherwise), Jimbo is empowered to step in and resolve matters with essentially absolute authority.  There is an expectation that he will use his 'fire extinguisher' sparingly, else editors would become restive and stop listening to him.  There is also a comfort&ndash;as long as Jimbo continues to be a trusted member of the community&ndash;that there ''is'' a desk at which the buck stops.

Further, our primary purpose is not to build a community or to develop new forms of government (though those might be beneficial side effects).  We are here to create an encyclopedia.  A popular comparison in Canadian constitutional law seems apt&mdash;my apologies for drawing yet more Candiana into the discussion.  The United States was forged in secession and revolution; the Declaration of Independence speaks of inalienable rights to "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"&mdash;it's heady stuff.  In contrast, the preamble of the Canadian Constitution grants powers for the purpose of establishing and maintaining "peace, order, and good government".  Canada has a reputation as a country that (mostly) politely and quietly goes about its business.  <br/>+:Wikipedia is an experiment in neither anarchy nor democracy.  It ''is'' an experiment in a new way to create an encyclopedia.  We should encourage behaviour which supports that goal, and strongly discourage actions which detract from that.  Editors who persist in actions which make it more difficult to achieve our goals should face censure or ejection.  Common sense should rule in that determination&ndash;see the 'Philosophical note' at [[WP:IAR|Ignore All Rules]]&ndash;rather than strict legalisms or bureacratic red tape.<br/>+:We're not here to provide a soapbox or forum for political discourse.  We're not building a utopia; we're building an encyclopedia.  If people would like an outlet for their free speech, take it to Uncyclopedia or Encyclopedia Dramatica.  They can start&ndash;and pay for&ndash;their own blog and their own bandwidth.  While such a policy may cause some people to leave, quite frankly they're not needed here.  They make it difficult for the quiet majority who would like to go about our work writing articles in peace.

It will not work, that "Please join our community, you will not get anything, you must work here, and even your rights are not maintained." Would you join WP if this would the advertisement? Not. And indeed the advertisement is different.

The line between consensus and democracy is a thin one, but the model being used is more akin to a republic than a democracy.  Keep in mind that at its heart, Wikipedia remains an experiment.  The pure democracy model has failed in the past for projects like this, as has the dictatorship, anarchosyndicate, etc.  Heck, even the republic model has failed before, but there are always tweaks to the system that can be tried.  Without putting words into Jimbos mouth, I think one answer to your question would be "the characteristics that are desirable for WP are those that work".  - [[User:Chairboy|C<small>HAIRBOY]]</small> ([[User_talk:Chairboy|☎]]) 14:50, 30 September 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+Chairboy: Your example about the sheep and the wolves is similar to my example about majority banning minority.

Currently on WP it is possible for the wolves to eat the sheep. In a modern democracy this is not possible, because there is constitution, there is tolerance, there are human rights, and so on. This is missing from WP. The policies are not enough. We need policies to ensure tolerance.

It's not a new argument, but most vandalism is down to anon users. In a constitutional monarchy or pretty much any other system, every person is required to register, either at birth or when they immigrate. The anon IP situation is a little like allowing a person from any nation in the world to visit without a passport, then allowing them to vote. I must admit it's a very forward thinking sort of idea, but the problems it creates are self-evident. However, having said that of late I have personally found that the vandalism issue appears to have lessened in proportion to the huge numbers of new legitimate contributors, though perhaps I'm just not paying as much attention to it any more.<br/>+<br/>+::By the way the image deletion issue (which I called a 'debacle', which might have been a bit strong) is not because of its necessity, which on the whole I understand, but due to its implementation, which caused a lot of unnecessary anger, and more to the point, damage to the encyclopedia, which is what really matters. However it did throw some light on the power structures of the system, and the most disturbing aspect of this to my mind is not the power vested in Jimbo, but in those who take it upon themselves to carry out ill-considered orders unquestioningly, invoking their presumed mandate from Jimbo whenever they are challenged. Somebody else here called them 'brownshirts' and I really understand where that person is coming from - I think it's a very apt analogy. And while the issue has more or less blown over at least for me (and now seems a bit of a storm in a teacup), one of the things I felt initially is that the arbitration and other systems that have evolved here to resolve problems are quite tricky to negotiate if you don't have any experience of it. If you're an ordinary contributor that has generally avoided conflict and confrontation, then when it arises the system can appear quite impenetrable. The feeling one is left with is helplessness. If the Wikipedia 'state' is to function, I wonder if some analog to lawyers and barristers is needed - to help ordinary users when they get into trouble work through the system. In other words a voluntary group of advocates one can call on to put one's case in the proper channels (and of course keeping their own views out of it). What do others think?

Well, as a practical matter, an active Wikipedian can exert more influence over this project than over any national government, however democratic it is.  My personal opinion, influenced by the inordinate amount of my volunteer time that's been consumed in dealing with a few problem users, is that we should move a little further ''away'' from a model based on individual rights.  In a few extreme instances, we should say, "This person is simply not suited to participate in a collaborative project.  To try to accommodate his involvement will take too much time on the part of other editors, admins, mediators, ArbCom members, etc., out of proportion to any benefit to the encyclopedia from his contributions."  People like that could reasonably be banned without nitpicking over whether they violated a specific policy.  Such an approach by a government, of course, would be quite improper.

We must respect this principle as sacred". This morning I checked a big amount of changes made by IP users in the de-Wikipedia. More than the half of it in this random sample was vandalism. Unfortunately, such vandalism paralyses the work of benevolent users. At [[:de:Wikipedia:Fragen_zur_Wikipedia#Dauervandalismus]] we are discussing solutions in that problem. I.e. in my opinion an e-mail registration to enable a Wikipedia account is a very small and easy barrier that could improve the quality tremendously.

The list of pop culture references was too long (I see that it has now been moved to a new article.) The "Biography" section was poorly assembled. But I still think "nearly unreadable crap" was harsh because the article would have brought a cold reader who knew nothing about Gates (and such people do exist) up to speed on his life. It described where he went to school, key milestones in the business he led, and interesting oddities such as his house.

Here are some points from a recent email to you:<br/>+<br/>+In my interpretation, the fundamental problem with the [[race and intelligence]] article (and area of research) is the lack of a logical rationale for what appears to be a highly unscientific method of presentation. Why do the proponents of the article go to great lengths to frame and describe the IQ test results disparity exclusively in racial terms when that is just one among many ways of presenting data? The article needs to disassociate description of an issue from analysises of the cause(s) for that issue. This should be basic NPOV policy, what is the article's proponents' rationale for utilizing such a narrowly focused and apparently extremely biasing presentation method?  If the proponents of the article are themselves "race and intelligence" or "intelligence" researchers and were trained in the scientific method then their one sided method of presentation is exponentially more puzzling.

If I take a picture of a lawnmower on top of a baby seal, add it to the article [[George Bush]], and caption it "George Bush likes to run over baby seals with his lawnmower"...then you need to have some sort of corroboration.  In other words, it's entirely verifiable that the picture shows a lawnmower on a baby seal; you need an independent and trustworthy source to support the claim of what the picture ''implies''.

There are a number of pages on Wikipedia which reproduce lists of things published elsewhere. For example, [[Newsweek's List of the 1,000 Top U.S. Schools (2005)]] and [[Newsweek’s List of Top High Schools (2003)]] are essentially reproductions of text published by Newsweek. It has been [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Newsweek’s List of Top High Schools (2003)|argued]] that these Wikipedia pages are not violations of Newsweek's copyright as they are merely names of schools. Quite so; however, it appears to me that these lists, ie. the ''ordering'' of these schools on the pages of Newsweek using data and analyses conducted by them, are their work, and is copyrightable. The interest of a page called ''Newsweek's List of the 1,000 Top U.S. Schools'' is really the ''ranking of the schools'' conducted by a reputable publisher, not so much the mere compendium of school names. As such it seems to me that to take such material and unilaterally publish them on the pages of Wikipedia under the GFDL licence is not lawful. Is it?

Basically, the case concluded with a decision to ban an administrator from communicating on the administrators' noticeboard, and also restricted my communication elsewhere by limiting what I can say about other admins. Mainly I criticize the decision for two reasons: 1) I was not given proper time to present evidence (I had a month, and admittedly did not use it, but I feel there should've been no rush, and I shouldn't be blamed for using my Wikipedia time primarily for actual editing instead of litigation&mdash;note that the ArbCom is always careful to acknowledge that my editing is good even if they think I have a horrible personality. I feel a temporary injunction could have alleviated any concerns about my allegedly problematic behavior while giving me time to gather evidence and discuss matters in detail with the arbitrators.) 2) I was contrite about my incivility on the AN pages, and I had clearly stopped making the kinds of comments the ArbCom objected to (partially for several months, completely for the most recent few weeks). I do maintain that the things I was complaining about were worse than my reactions to them (deeds being more harmful than words), but I fully acknowledge that I was excessive in the criticism and it would've been more constructive if it had been toned down. Part of the reason why I often reacted so bitterly was because I saw in the mistreatment of others the same mistreatment that was done to me early in the year, and wanted them to be treated fairly by our more aggressive admins. But this contrition was disregarded entirely by the arbitrators. I'm not sure why. Possibly they thought I was being insincere; possibly they felt that a case that had progressed so far had to reach the normal conclusion (a punitive ruling); possibly other reasons.<br/>+<br/>+As far as other reasons go, one of them was stated by Raul in an IRC conversation I had with him: basically, my views are illogical and crazy and therefore aren't acceptable even if I am perfectly civil about them. So it's irrelevant if I apologize for the incivility; the views still need to be kept quiet. How do you, personally, feel about this notion? Another reason was more overt: they said that my comments were "ignorant" and I needed to research situations before commenting on them. I deny that they were uninformed in general, and could have offered a mountain of proof of my comments being obviously informed by the evidence of the cases I was considering; furthermore, the ArbCom is itself guilty of ignoring the evidence in ''three'' cases against me (there are numerous comments on the cases' various talk pages illustrating blatant ignorance of the matters they were arbitrating), so even if I was guilty here they'd be in no position to judge me.<br/>+<br/>+I would like to hear your thoughts about the situation?

I told him that Wikipedia isn't that sort of project, but was wondering if there was a project like that on Wikimedia so I could give him a definite answer.

The precedent, in the U.S. at least (it differs in other countries, which makes for a problem for a multinational site like this) is that pure factual information is not copyrightable, but  anything involving creative expression is; hence, as was ruled in a court case, a telephone directory was not copyrightable because it simply presented names and addresses in alphabetic order, representing no creativity either in the selection of who to include or the order they were presented. A music chart has more claim at protection given that Billboard uses some sort of proprietary method to generate it, but to the extent that they claim it to be a scientific representation of the most popular music of the time without any subjectivity in its selection, the more it becomes purely factual in nature and unprotectable.  Even if the complete chart is copyrightable, giving positions of individual songs/albums on it is probably fair use; it has never been considered a copyright violation to report on the winners of Academy Awards, even if the process of selecting them involves subjectivity and creativity on the part of the Academy and its members; the mere fact that somebody won an Oscar in a particular category in a particular year is still purely factual.  The same probably holds for music chart positions.

When archiving old discussions off this page, please do ''not'' archive this section --><br/>+<br/>+Contributors frequently propose new criteria for speedy deletion. If you have a proposal to offer, please keep a few guidelines in mind:<br/>+<br/>+* The criterion should be '''objective''': an article that a reasonable person judges as fitting or not fitting the criterion should be similarly judged by other reasonable people. Often this requires making the rule very specific. An example of an unacceptably ''subjective'' criterion might be "an article about something unimportant."<br/>+* The criterion should be '''uncontestable''': it should be the case that ''almost all'' articles that can be deleted using the rule, should be deleted, according to general consensus. If a rule paves the path for deletions that will cause controversy, it probably needs to be restricted. In particular, don't propose a CSD in order to overrule ''keep'' votes that might otherwise occur in AfD. Don't forget that a rule may be used in a way you don't expect if not carefully worded.<br/>+* The criterion should '''arise frequently''': speedy deletion was created as a means of decreasing load on other deletion methods such as [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion]] and [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion]]. But these other methods are often more effective because they treat articles on a case-by-case basis and incorporate many viewpoints; CSD exchanges these advantages for the practical goal of expeditious, lightweight cleanup. If a situation arises rarely, it's probably easier, simpler, and more fair to delete it via one of these other methods instead. This also keeps CSD as simple and easy to remember as possible.<br/>+* The criterion should be '''nonredundant''': if an admin can accomplish the deletion using a reasonable interpretation of an existing rule, just use that. If this application of that rule is contested, consider discussing and/or clarifying it. Only if a new rule covers articles that cannot be speedy deleted otherwise should it be considered.<br/>+<br/>+If you do have a proposal that you believe passes these guidelines, please feel free to propose it on this discussion page. Be prepared to offer evidence of these points and to refine your criterion if necessary. Consider explaining how it meets these criteria when you propose it. Do not, on the other hand, add it unilaterally to the CSD page.<br/>+__TOC__<br/>+<br/>+== proposed I8: Images available on Commons (again) ==<br/>+<br/>+This is a perennial proposal, but I really don't understand why this does not fly. Here is an attemp on a compromise, sligthly wordy but it seems needed. This proposal meets all the criteria a proposal has to meet: It's objective (a checklist), it's uncontestable (images properly mived to Commons are routinely deleted at IFD, and this proposal includes an escape clause), it arises frequently (thousands of images meet it), it's nonredundant (obviously).<br/>+<br/>+'''I8''': Images available as bit-for-bit identical copies on Commons, provided the following conditions are met:<br/>+* The image's license and source status is beyond reasonable doubt, and the license is undoubtedly accepted at Commons.<br/>+* All image revisions that meet the first condition have been transferred to Commons as revisions of the Commons copy and properly marked as such.<br/>+* All information on the image description page is present on the Commons image description page. That includes the complete upload history with links to the uploader's local user pages.<br/>+** If there is any information not relevant to any other project on the image description page (like featured status), the image description page must be undeleted after the file deletion.<br/>+* The image is not protected, and the image description page does not contain a request not to move it to Commons.<br/>+* The image has been marked with [[Template:NowCommons]] or [[Template:NowCommonsThis]] for at least one week.<br/>+* If the image is available on Commons under a different name than locally, it must not be used on any local page whatsoever.<br/>+<br/>+That is more complicated than is required (the second and third points in particular are not required for public domain images at all), but they don't hurt either. Of course, administrators acting on this need to be well-versed with image licensing policy both here and on Commons, but people interested in this criterion generally are.

[[User:GRBerry|GRBerry]] 19:07, 19 June 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+*OK, here's a shot at it: "An article about a business or corporation that does not assert the importance or significance of its subject, or consists solely of advertising for the company or its products or services."  Like existing criterion A7 for people, this limits speedies to articles where notability is not asserted -- if it is, even incorrectly, the article has to go to prod or afd.<br/>+<br/>+As for the above discussion, one thing that I think has changed is the frequency of the problem.  I spend a lot of time categorizing articles, and a lot of the articles showing up with "uncategorized" tags are corporate spam -- often 5-10 a day.  Most of these would fail the above proposed category, and I think few if any "good" articles, or even future good articles, would be eliminated. [[User:NawlinWiki|NawlinWiki]] 19:23, 19 June 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+I saw the discussion above, which is part of why I decided to propose it. Everyone seems to be in agreement that this is needed, with the previous discussion's only reservation being how often it comes up, which I've addressed (there are plenty more examples at [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion]], if anyone isn't yet convinced). As for the others:<br/>+*''Objective:'' I see the criteria as being very similar to that for nn bands: failing to assert notability (in that case [[WP:MUSIC]], in this case [[WP:CORP]])<br/>+*''Uncontestable:'' As I've said, the votes for these articles are never controversial; even the authors themselves haven't claimed notability so there isn't much discussion beyond "Delete, spamvertisment" or something similar.<br/>+*''Non-redundant:'' If there is another criterion that addresses this, I would love to know so that we could start using it. [[User:Recury|Recury]] 19:24, 19 June 2006 (UTC)<br/>+I can support the first clause that NawlinWiki proposed: "An article about a business or corporation that does not assert the importance or significance of its subject".  I'm not sure about the second part.  The [[Virospack]] article example (#4 above) is one that could be read either way on "consists solely of advertising", but it also fails to assert notability.  Do we need the second clause?  Hmm, we could have a clear advertising claim (best/fastest/most) that is also an assertion of notability.  I think I'd rather see those go through Prod/AFD.  [[User:GRBerry|GRBerry]] 19:46, 19 June 2006 (UTC)<br/>+:I see what you're saying. But I don't think every best/fastest/most claim should be considered a claim to notability. Virospack's is that it is basically the best "specialist manufacturer of packaging for skin care and treatment products" which wouldn't be notable even if it were true, IMO. Certainly something like a claim to being the best independent fernery in Eastern Okeechobee County wouldn't be. Maybe a "significant advertising claim"? [[User:Recury|Recury]] 19:56, 19 June 2006 (UTC)<br/>+:I think it makes some sense to discount empty, meaningless superlatives like "best" (in what way?), "most popular" (among who? according to who?), or "most recommended" (by who? according to who?). I think the strategy I would take is:<br/>+:* One person edits out the meaningless claims.<br/>+:* Another person notes that there is no longer any claim of notability and deletes it.<br/>+:I'm not entirely sure whether this is considered "cheating", but if removing something that should be removed anyway leaves a speediable article it would seem like the article as a whole should be speediable. [[User:Deco|Deco]] 23:09, 19 June 2006 (UTC)<br/>+::A two step speedy deletion is a waste of effort, I'll agree.  But we'd need to be restrictive in the G4, in that if the article comes back with citations for the claims to ''independent'' sources, then the article is sufficiently different to not be speedyable again.<br/>+::Here are all of the companies sent to AFD yesterday: [[Google]] (speedy kept), [[Gecko sales]], [[Pulseware]], [[PC CLINIC Computer Service Center]], [[IR Gurus]], [[Macarthur Square]] (a mall is a company), [[Quova]], [[Virospack]] (#4 above), [[Vertek]], [[Doobstar]] (#2 above, and nominator BigDT said we need a CSD for things like this), [[Mochila]] (#1 above), [[Museum of Skateboard History]], [[IEI Food]], [[Intelliworks]], and [[Advocacy Investing]].<br/>+::Ignoring Google, we had 15 AFD nominations yesterday.  Only [[Mochila]] (link to NYTimes article) and [[Advocacy Investing]] (media coverage in last paragraph) make solid claims to notability.  How about "An article about a business or corporation that does not assert the importance or significance of its subject, or that cites no independent coverage (i.e. not press release reprints) and consists solely of advertising for the company or its products or services."  That way if it is only advertising, but actually cites independent coverage it will go to AFD.  With independent coverage, there is both a debatable chance of notability and a start on the sourcing needed to produce a NPOV version.

[[User:GRBerry|GRBerry]] 02:13, 22 June 2006 (UTC)<br/>+::::I don't think it's that vague; "point-of-view" is probably a good word to use because it describes the intent of the writer, which is very easy to tell. The problem with many of the articles on companies that are notable is that they are obviously written by a PR guy or the company's president and they all sound like [[DataSynapse|this]] instead of [[IBM|this]]. It's almost impossible to go from the first to the second without just totally rewriting it (an important thing to point out to editors who would say "just fix it instead of deleting it"). At least this way the PR people will eventually get that, for their article to have a chance, it has to sound encyclopedic. Just to emphasize that people should be writing encyclopedia articles, how about "...or is written from a corporate or promotional, instead of encyclopedic, point-of-view"? [[User:Recury|Recury]] 02:38, 22 June 2006 (UTC)<br/>+::::: I have to disagree with your presumption that the intent of the writer is easy to determine.

[[User:Rossami|Rossami]] <small>[[User talk:Rossami|(talk)]]</small> 03:22, 22 June 2006 (UTC)<br/>+It's only the ones at the extremes that we want to speedy: they either make absolutely no claim at notability or they make absolutely no attempt at writing an encyclopedia article. Maybe the language just needs to be stronger. [[User:Recury|Recury]] 13:29, 22 June 2006 (UTC)<br/>+: Understood.  My concern is that none of the wordings proposed so far really define the extremes clearly.  They leave more ambiguity than is healthy for a CSD criterion.  Unfortunately, I don't have a proposal for better wording.  On the other hand, 15 nominations on a sample day is not too bad.  Maybe we don't need a CSD criterion yet.  [[User:Rossami|Rossami]] <small>[[User talk:Rossami|(talk)]]</small> 01:32, 23 June 2006 (UTC)<br/>+::How about just "it is an article about a company that does not assert the importance or significance of the subject. (CSD A7)" We probably don't even really need the second clause about spam/promotional stuff. Unless we can just start using db-bio on them, but that doesn't seem right since they aren't "biographies" really. [[User:Recury|Recury]] 11:12, 23 June 2006 (UTC)<br/>+I oppose this expansion, even if we limit it to not asserting significance.  I don't think speedy is the way to handle this problem.  Delete if necessary, but give it a chance to be improved first.

Since I'm not an admin, I can't look back at the June 19th example day, but looking at the June 29th list, here's what I find in terms of nn corp-related discussions.  Out of 208 nominations: (1) [[Greendale Construction Limited]] ([[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Greendale Construction Limited {{{2|}}}|AfD]]) -- contested prod, speedied for lack of context, (2) [[Island Group Company, Ltd.]] ([[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Island Group Company, Ltd. {{{2|}}}|AfD]]) -- relist, uncontroversial, don't know if prod was tried, (3) [[Alliance architects]] ([[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Alliance architects {{{2|}}}|AfD]]) -- speedy may not apply, weak claims of notability made, prod not tried, (4) [[Z_Games]] ([[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Z_Games {{{2|}}}|AfD]]) - speedy wouldn't apply, prod not tried, (5) [[Prosperity Automated System]] ([[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Prosperity Automated System {{{2|}}}|AfD]]) - speedy might apply, recreated after prod deletion, (6) [[Seat24]] ([[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Seat24 {{{2|}}}|AfD]]) - speedy might apply, prod not tried, (7) [[Snuggle]] ([[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Snuggle {{{2|}}}|AfD]]) - speedy wouldn't apply, will be kept, (8) [[ThugLine Records]] ([[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/ThugLine Records {{{2|}}}|AfD]]) - prod not tried, speedy wouldn't apply, controversial, (9) [[Apocalypse games]] ([[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Apocalypse games {{{2|}}}|AfD]]) -- speedy would apply, prod contested, (10) [[St. Croix (store)]] ([[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/St. Croix (store) {{{2|}}}|AfD]]) -- speedy might apply, but deletion is controversial, prod not tried, (11) [[Beck Theatre]] ([[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Beck Theatre {{{2|}}}|AfD]]) -- speedy might well apply, prod not tried, (12) [[FakeAlibi]] ([[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/FakeAlibi {{{2|}}}|AfD]]) -- speedy wouldn't apply, prod not tried, (13) [[Southern Highlands Golf Club]] ([[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Southern Highlands Golf Club {{{2|}}}|AfD]]) -- speedy wouldn't apply ("world famous"), prod contested, (14) [[Armor Lock & Safe Co., Inc.]] ([[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Armor Lock & Safe Co., Inc. {{{2|}}}|AfD]]) -- speedy deleted as blatant spam (!), (15) [[New Horizon Films Ltd.]] ([[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/New Horizon Films Ltd. {{{2|}}}|AfD]]) -- speedy may/may not apply, prod not tried, and (16) [[True Blue PC]] ([[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/True Blue PC {{{2|}}}|AfD]]) -- speedy would def. apply, prod not tried.  My summary: having a speedy deletion criteria for nn corp would have helped #5 and #9, and made #14 legitimate.  The rest, either speedy wouldn't apply or prod wasn't tried, so the conclusion is people should use PROD more.  But while we're at it, note that in the case of #10, harm might actually be done; the article doesn't really claim notability, but all votes are for keeping.  I think the trouble is that it's one thing for an article on some nn software company or consulting firm, but other kinds of businesses it's tricky.  See [[Alien Workshop]] ([[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Alien Workshop {{{2|}}}|AfD]]) for instance: not "notable" but not everything must be; some areas are small.

Of course, as soon as someone edits it, they change the second ot the first. Articles just don't say "x is notable because". For example. [[Prime number]] doesn't even mention the word ''notable''. [[User:Stephen B Streater|Stephen B Streater]] 21:01, 25 July 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::: Actually the former example could not be speedied either as it is plainly a claim to notability.

These taggings were correct in sentiment: one image included the word "Dumbass" under a person's picture.  Of couse, CSD A6 doesn't apply to images; I am also wary of elevating A6 to General status, because (although personal attacks are always bad), I wouldn't want a personal attack speedy applied to a project-page in the midst of sometimes heated policy discussions.<br/>+<br/>+In cases so far, I have deleted the attack images under G3, which is, in fact, what was formerly done for personal attack articles prior to A6 being adopted.  Still, to clarify matters, I would propose an image criterion allowing for the speedy deletion of images obviously intended with the sole intent to disparage someone.  I don't think this is controversial: it wouldn't cover uploading images that might be called "unflattering" (eg., the first President Bush vomiting on the Prime Minister of Japan), but would cover a case where the image (or its description) literally labeled someone a "moron," etc.  I know G3 applies, but (as with the creation of A6), a specific criterion makes the issue more clear for all. [[User:Xoloz|Xoloz]] 02:17, 22 June 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:Having drawn no objection, nor comment, I will add CSD I8 as a corollary (and rephrasing) of A6, and see what people think then.

[[User:Arbitrary username|Arbitrary username]] 06:23, 27 June 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+== G4 revision ==<br/>+<br/>+This picks up on points in the "nn corporations" discussion above, but I think it's different enough to warrant a new section.  G4 contains a sentence that:<br/>+<br/>+:In case of a ''speedily''-deleted page, they must also determine that it met a criterion for speedy deletion in the first place.<br/>+<br/>+I envisage a problem with this, that a page is deleted say under A7, because the author has omitted the assertion of notability.  It is speedied.  The author recreates the page, otherwise identical, but this time including an assertion of notability.  Someone may still decide that the recreated version is "substantially identical", and speedy it again, as the test described here is whether the criterion was met for the ''earlier'' deletion (which it was).<br/>+<br/>+I think it would be better to replace the sentence with:<br/>+<br/>+:''Speedily''-deleted pages are not re-deletable under this rule alone, but may be deleted under another applicable speedy deletion criterion.  (This is a safeguard to ensure that the new content still meets the criterion.)<br/>+<br/>+Comments?<br/>+<br/>+[[User:Arbitrary username|Arbitrary username]] 11:17, 27 June 2006 (UTC)<br/>+:At a glance seems like instruction creep. If a claim of notability actually has been added, it's ''not'' "substantially identical", so the G4 would be invalid. The new version could be deleted under A7 again if it's different but there's still no assertion of notability... there's no need to add more instruction for what can already be done. --[[User:W.marsh|W.marsh]] 13:02, 27 June 2006 (UTC)<br/>+::To me, it makes no sense that we should have to have a rule to speedy delete recreated articles that were speedied in the first place--because clearly they already fall under other speedy criteria.  You're not really speedying it because it was previously deleted, IMO, but because it fails some other criteria. [[User:NickelShoe|NickelShoe]] ([[User talk:NickelShoe|Talk]]) 04:58, 28 June 2006 (UTC)<br/>+:::Isn't the G4 criterion primarily for items that were deleted in a non-speedy fashion the first time around, and wouldn't be speedies except that they're recreations of deleted material? -[[User:GTBacchus|GTBacchus]]<sup>([[User talk:GTBacchus|talk]])</sup> 05:01, 28 June 2006 (UTC)<br/>+::::All the comments above are correct. There was an article recently that had previously been speedily deleted, but I did not speedy it for being a speedy deletion or recreated content because it had not gone through AfD and I was not sure that it met the speedy deletion criteria. -- [[User:Kjkolb|Kjkolb]] 06:30, 28 June 2006 (UTC)<br/>+:::::Does anyone actually object to me making the proposed change?  I don't think it's "instruction creep", as by making the rule ''not'' apply to speedily-deleted pages, it's ''reducing'' the scope to what is actually necessary.  The change is only instruction creep in the minor sense that by adding an explanatory comment in brackets we are increasing the number of words.  If that's really an issue, we can discuss the wording.<br/>+:::::By making the rule ''not'' apply to ''speedily''-deleted pages, in one go we remove a whole stack of ridiculous anomalies that arise from the present wording of G4.  All of the following examples (list below) are re-deletable under the letter of G4 as it stands, simply because the ''original'' deletion met the criterion, even though common sense says that the recreated page should no longer be deletable because of the now changed circumstances.  By proposing a change with would prevent G4 from applying to speedies, the requester/admin would be forced to consider whether a valid speedy criterion ''still'' applies.<br/>+:::::* A bio deleted under A7, recreated with a lot of previously speedied content plus the additon of a relatively short but all-important claim of notability.  May well judged to be "substantially identical" to the deleted version (even if we argue that it shouldn't be) hence re-deletable under G4.<br/>+:::::* A page speedied under G5 (banned user).  Recreated with identical content after the ban expires.  Re-deletable under G4.<br/>+:::::* An orphaned talk page (perhaps created as an orphan in the first place), speedied under G8.   The corresponding article is subsequently created, with its talk page.  The talk page is re-deletable under G4.<br/>+:::::* A copyvio speedied under A8.  Permission is subsequently obtained and noted, and the page recreated verbatim.  Re-deletable under G4.<br/>+:::::* A redirect with no target is speedied under R1.  The target is subsequently created.  Redirect recreated.  Redirect re-deletable under G4.<br/>+:::::* An image exists with two filenames A and B.  B is speedied under I1 (redundant).  After a change of plan, filename B is prefered, so A is deleted and B recreated.  B is redeletable under G4.<br/>+:::::* An unused copyrighted image is speedied under I5.  The image is subsequently uploaded again, and this time used in a page under fair use.  Image re-deletable under G4.<br/>+:::::* Empty category speedied under C1.  Category recreated and populated.  Category re-deletable under G4.<br/>+:::::* User requests deletion of subpage under U1.  If user ever recreates it, it is re-deletable  under G4 on request by ''any'' user.<br/>+:::::[[User:Arbitrary username|Arbitrary username]] 23:42, 29 June 2006 (UTC)<br/>+:::::: I think you're reading too much into it.  G4 has ''never'' applied to speedy-deletions.  G4 does not allow any of the situations you cite above.  It ''only'' applies to content which was decided through a full XfD discussion.  A page can be re-speedied if the original speedy-deletion justification still applies but not as recreated content.  And, yes, I am concerned about increasing the wordiness of the instruction.  The page is already much longer than it should be.  How about this change instead?  I think it makes the clarification you are looking for but in even fewer words than the current.

Pages which have never gone through one of these deletion discussions (i.e. pages which have only ever been speedily deleted) must not be speedied with this criterion.''<br/>+Which seems to say most of what Rossami's version does, although PROD did not yet exist and would need adding. The blanket exception for user space is difficult to apply with the advent of MfD. -[[User:Splash|Splash]] - [[User talk:Splash|tk]] 16:31, 30 June 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:"Regular deletion processes" looks good at first glance, until you compare the number of pages speedied per day to those deleted by other processes.  The number that usually gets thrown about is 2000 deletions a day as of November 2005, I believe; no more than two or three hundred of those are nonspeedies.  If "XfD" is too jargony - and I don't think it is, keeping in mind that not only is this a page primarily aimed at the Wikipedia community, it's aimed at administrators and rc/np-patrollers - then "discussion-based deletion processes" might work.  Specifically enumerating speedy deletion and prod doesn't seem the way to go, since it's not inconceivable we could add more g4-immune processes in the future.<br/>+<br/>+:As for the userspace exception: perhaps "or was moved into the [[Wikipedia:User page|user space]]"? &mdash;[[User:Lamentation/sig|Lamentation]] [[User talk:Lamentation|:(]] 16:51, 30 June 2006 (UTC)<br/>+::I would explicitly exempt prod and speedy deletion.

The discussion has now been idle for a few days, and nothing has yet being changed.  I think there is a risk that this discussion gets forgotten without leading to any action.  So to avoid this, I am now going to implement Rossami's version, on the grounds that it is at least better than the status quo.  If details of the wording can be further improved, then let's iterate from here.  [[User:Arbitrary username|Arbitrary username]] 15:29, 4 July 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+I have 2 suggestions:<br/>+* The last sentence: ''Such cases should be taken to Articles for deletion for discussion by the community'' should IMHO be changed into ''Such cases should be taken to '''XfD''' for discussion by the community''.<br/>+:::Yes, I agree with you, and imagine that this change is uncontroversial.  I'm going to be bold and put it in. [[User:Arbitrary username|Arbitrary username]] 21:26, 4 July 2006 (UTC)<br/>+* Suppose somebody copied some text from a website. It is marked as copyvio and then deleted. It is recreated. Should it be speedied, even when it does not fully satisfy A8 (for example it was not identified within 48 h)? I think it should. According to the original sentence it should. According to the current meaning not.

As a result some new adspam articles sit on AFD for up to a week, when it's really very clear within hours that they're almost certainly non-notable and rapidly heading for [[WP:SNOW]].<br/>+<br/>+I'm thinking of this one, as an example of such an article: [[Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Kimi_height|WP:AFD/Kimi height]]. <br/>+<br/>+How would people feel about a policy tweak, either <br/>+# "Reroute to SD" is a valid response and consensus on AFD, or alternatively,<br/>+# WP:SD allows rerouting blatent non-starters from AFD to SD, given admin concurrance and AFD voting to date?<br/>+<br/>+What I'm thinking of is something simple, like that an advertizing article ''may'' be moved from AFD to SD "at admin discretion", if it appears to be NN advertising, ''and'' AFD appears to have already reached a tentative consensus (eg,to the point of WP:SNOW)? <br/>+<br/>+Just to have a way for the more blatent judgement cases to be handled faster.

Any image with a clearly invalid fair-use tag (such as a {{tl|logo}} tag on a photograph of a mascot) can be deleted at any time.<br/>+<br/>+This is a bad rule, primarily because an image that has an invalid fair-use tag on it may still be permissable under a ''correct'' fair-use tag, and other tags should be considered first. IfD is an appropriate forum for these considerations, as the deleting admin may not know an appropriate tag either. In addition, the rule does not require examining the history; it may be that the image once had a valid fair use tag but it was replaced with an invalid one. These are not theoretical issues, because the person who added the tag may have simply chosen the wrong one, for lack of knowledge of either fair use or our tag system.<br/>+<br/>+Even more bizarrely, this rule allows an "attack" in which a user can replace a fair use image's tag with an invalid fair use tag, then an admin (perhaps the same user!) deletes it. [[User:Deco|Deco]] 23:14, 27 June 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:I disagree. It's the admin's duty to ''check'' for this sort of thing, and somebody with no grasp of [[Wikipedia:Fair use]] shouldn't be dealing with CSD I7 (arguably they shouldn't be an admin at all, though that's debatable) - they'll get a good kick up the backside from the uploader if they messed up on an I7 call. We rely on admins to actually understand the rules they are using and to take due care when exercising them: I guess that's the main point of [[WP:RFA]]. A tag-swap attack would be blatant vandalism, I can't think that any serious user would ever want to do it or that a vandal or troll would get away with it. An admin can always change a CSD I7 nom into a "fair use disputed" tag in marginal cases where they may be a more suitable tag but they can't think which, and there is image undeletion in reserve if necessary. I think what you may be emphasising insufficiently is that having the right tag doesn't make something fair use - what matters is the rationale which all fair use images should have regardless of tag. There are plenty of instances where, for instance, "screenshot" is the correct tag but the image would not come under "fair use" doctrine the way it has been used in an article. Putting on a fair use tag is often (almost always!) an excuse for not bothering to write a rationale - and in these circumstances often no rationale would be very convincing. An image whose sole justification for its use in Wikipedia is an ''incorrect'' fair use copyright tag with no obvious alternative is almost certain to have no good fair use rationale, and should be viewed completely analagously to an image that has been uploaded with the "standard" fair use template and no rationale. This is the deeper logic behind I7 - it shouldn't be a way to evade the "standard template, no rationale" CSD criteria to throw an absolutely random fair use tag on. [[User:TheGrappler|TheGrappler]] 08:00, 28 June 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::But the action that I7 enables - immediate deletion with no waiting period - is even stricter than that for standard template, no rationale images. I'll admit that a tag swap attack is unrealistic, and that admins are (supposedly) supposed to check the history on every speedy, but I still think the decision of whether or not a more suitable tag is available is too subjective to assign to one person. Finally, the argument that it is essentially the justification that matters, not the tag, is something of an argument against the rule - what if they provide a clearly invalid tag with a perfectly valid justification? Such cases could be dealt with by a thinking admin with appropriate tag-changing, but I'd ideally like the letter of the rule - or at least the accompanying interpretation - to reflect this. [[User:Deco|Deco]] 03:41, 30 June 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:::I can see where you are coming from. Usually the existence or not of a suitable tag is pretty obvious, though sometimes it's not so clear. In the borderline cases a "good admin" would seek help. I suppose I am partly influenced here my philosophy that (a) our admins should be - and on the whole, are - very good, (b) and we should trust them with as many revertible powers as possible that keep the wheels of Wikipedia running smoothly. If I7 was being regularly abused by admins then I might change my mind about it, though.

And, even in cases where they do come back, it usually happens quickly, within two or three days. Right now, I'm not considering a formal proposal, but would like to see what everyone thinks of the idea. [[User:AlbertR|Alr]] 21:47, 4 July 2006 (UTC)<br/>+:Probably not a good idea; it will burn some people, who edit weekly, quite badly in exchange for slightly increasing the speed of removal.

The reason I added them was specifically to try and remove the "smoke and mirrors" that seems to come with those terms. The removal of [[Template:User transhumanist]] was what made it seem inconsistent to me. If we look literally at the term '''divisive''' then a template simply stating you are male clearly and undeniably '''IS''' divisive. So why the does this stay and others go? Clearly we do need to state definitions here and what better definition than one provided from this set of websites itself? The template is also not inflammatory, there is no global outcry or shouts of injustice or immorality with transhumanism, and with any topic there can always be those who vehemently oppose something... if I were to start objecting profusely against those people who like spagetti would it turn that template into an inflammatory one? I personally find religion itself offensive (as do many others), so a userbox which states someone follows a particular religion is something I would object against... so why do they have a right to exist but stating a belief in ones own evolution is considered "divisive and inflammatory"? The problem has not subsided... it has been moved into "slow motion" with templates being deleted every now and then in order to avoid the "do not go on mass deletions" dictate. [[User:Enigmatical|Enigmatical]] 22:29, 4 July 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:I agree with Tony's edit, precisely because this rule is not to be interpreted literally but based on consensus and precedent. It would be better to provide links to some relevant undeletion debates. [[User:Deco|Deco]] 17:38, 5 July 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::Well I have often found in a lot of cases where disagreement occurs it is a result of differing terms. One believes it means one thing and the other believes it means another. They both argue the other is wrong when in reality it is just a case of them not agreeing on the fundamental definition of what they are arguing over. I have also found that often those who wish to '''abuse''' terminology don't wish that terminology to be properly defined because in doing so it nullifies their ability to abuse it. Keep the term more.... ''fuzzy'' and thus you can always claim that something falls within its definition. It was my hope, ''in good faith'' to try and eliminate confusion and the potential for abuse by simply making the terminology clearer. I guess we must now go through another several months of the same old thing without any resolution of the matter. Is that desired? [[User:Enigmatical|Enigmatical]] 23:03, 5 July 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:::The original wording assumed a definition of both of the words. It did not place its worth on the definitions that Wikisource is able to come up with. It is much like saying you have to define every word explicitly or else it will be "fuzzy". The criteria survived a strenuous initiation period and should be fine as it is, given the low number of templates likely to be even under it given the recent happenings (see [[WP:JOU|Jimbo on Userboxes]]). Also, it is all well and good to complain when I put warnings about assuming good faith on your talk page, maybe you should be less hasty to put the words "bad faith edit" in your edit summaries.

[[User:Deco|Deco]] 18:12, 6 July 2006 (UTC)<br/>+::The reason to call it "patent nonsense" is so that G1 can refer to [[Wikipedia:Patent Nonsense]], which gives a more extensive definition.

If there is only one lower taxon, the higher taxon should redirect to the lower one anyway, so this rule always applies. (for example, ''Homo sapiens'' should NOT redirect to hominadae, but the other way around) People from TOL [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Tree_of_Life#Redirects_and_listing_links here] have already agreed that this is bad practice (in short, species articles shouldn't redirect to genus articles, etc). I also nominated a couple articles like that for speedy deletion, and were indeed deleted. I just want it to be an official rule --[[User:TheAlphaWolf|TheAlphaWolf]] 17:13, 7 July 2006 (UTC)<br/>+:I don't think this will work because unless you can explain it ''far'' more simply than above then its just too complicated (and possibly too specific) to work. IMHO speedy deletion criteria must be obvious, succinct and memorable. I also forsee the potential for many exceptions to be arguable in good faith. I know next to nothing about the subject area, and when I've looked up taxinomic names there seems to be no logic to whether the name I've heard of is a species, family or whatever. [[User:Thryduulf|Thryduulf]] 21:29, 7 July 2006 (UTC)<br/>+:This rule isn't suitable for speedy deletion as it requires admins to know taxonomy, which they might not.  Also, I don't think that these redirects are always a bad idea.  For example, an article on a family might include a list of genera broken down into subfamilies, in which case there seems no harm in redirecting the subfamily to the family; or, an article on a genus might include brief descriptions of some of its species in the case where there is insufficient material to warrant a separate article.  [[User:Spacepotato|Spacepotato]] 22:26, 7 July 2006 (UTC)<br/>+::Assume that the admin reviewing the nomination has no specialist scientific training - even someone with a PhD in a field like physics probably wouldn't have the relevant training.  Format the criteria so that they can tell just by following the redirect whether  the criteria is met.  KPCOFGS isn't that hard to remember. (heck, it ought to be a redirect or a short article, but it isn't.)  However, [[Taxon]] tells us that there are different systems that can rank the same thing (current example is [[liverworts]]) at different levels.  How would the non-science specialist be able to tell if it is a redirect from one system to another that is legitimate versus a same system redirect that isn't legitimate.  I've glanced at the criteria for proposals above, and if you can make it easy for the non-scientist to figure out, this shouldn't have much trouble.<br/>+::Alternatively, folks could just make a practice of converting a lower taxon redirect to a stub whenever they see one.  No need for a CSD if that practice evolves, and wikipedia gets better with that stub.  [[User:GRBerry|GRBerry]] 22:13, 7 July 2006 (UTC)<br/>+:This was written at a point when only Thryduulf had responded: Also, there was not that much participation at the talk page linked to, and I'm unconvinced that redirecting to the genus is a bad idea. The only downside that I can see is that you would not be able to tell that there was not an article on the species from looking at the link. Unless we intend to create individual articles for many, many species, I don't know if this is enough of a problem to prevent redirecting to the genus. Most species will probably not have articles for decades, and they may never have articles. Redirecting to the genus or some other higher taxon will at least give people some information. I don't think it is misleading, as was claimed on the talk page. Many topics are redirected to a larger or similar one. -- [[User:Kjkolb|Kjkolb]] 23:37, 7 July 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:First, about explaining it more easily- Redirecting lower to higher taxons is bad practice when lower taxons aren't described in the article. That's the reason. I think it qualifies as "obvious, succinct and memorable". Also, you said "I know next to nothing about the subject area, and when I've looked up taxinomic names there seems to be no logic to whether the name I've heard of is a species, family or whatever."... That's Part of the point. If someone like you searches a species name and gets redirected to a genus article, it will just confuse you and make life harder for you won't it? To put it simply, redirecting lower to higher taxons is the same thing as redirecting to the wrong article. For obvious reasons redirecting to the wrong article shouldn't be allowed. <br/>+<br/>+:About this requiring admins to know taxonomy, well... I can't help that. You're expecting us not to delete bad articles because they require knowledge of the subject matter? How then do you suppose the wrong things, vandalism, etc. will be fixed? If you don't know taxonomy, let me use a simple example. I'm sure you know that there are many types of monkeys right? Well, say you type in "Capuchin monkey" and it redirects you to "monkey". That's obviously wrong and should be deleted don't you think? That's a lower taxon redirecting to a higher one. Same thing with what I'm talking about. I can't help it if admins have to know some about taxonomy. <br/>+<br/>+:About that rule not always applying, I fixed the rule, because I guess you're right :P However, I've been across many redirects where the lower taxon isn't mentioned in the higher one. <br/>+<br/>+:GRBerry, you bring up a good point. Taxonomy is a pain, lol. And really I can't think of a way to solve that problem. However, how else do you propose us non-admins help contribute to wikipedia? The other day I tried to get a lower to higher taxon redirect deleted, and I'm guessing the admin didn't know about taxonomy (I'm not claiming I'm a taxonomer or anything, but this was obviously wrong), s/he deleted my tag. I'm proposing this category for speedy deletion so that we regular members can use a tag and cite the rule. That way, redirects that should be deleted are deleted, not left there to confuse people only because the admin isn't a taxonomist. If my proposed criterion is added, the admin wouldn't need to be a taxonomist. <br/>+<br/>+:Kjkolb , Here are (some of) my reasons for deleting those kinds of redirects:<br/>+:1. If someone searches a species name, they want to know about that species. They don't want to know about the genus or family, they want information specific to the species.<br/>+:2. For obvious reasons, linking species names in the genus page is pointless (say you have a genus article with a list of species, something which is very common), as they will redirect to the same page. If someone searches the genus and then wants to find out more about specific species, it is very annoying to have to copy and paste the unlinked name and then search, only to be redirected to the article you were reading in the first place. The same one that promted you to want to know more about specific species. <br/>+:3. It discourages people from making species articles. Many people who make articles are newbies, and they may not know how to start an article if their topic redirects to another page. Another issue are common names, it is annoying to have to change the redirects, and even more knowledgeable members may one- not know all the common names, or two- forget about some of them. This means that (for example) searching the scientific name of a plant will take you to it's own article, but searching one or more of it's common names will take you to the genus article. Obviously this is annoying and it makes wikipedia look bad. <br/>+:4. As mentioned above, not everyone is a taxonomist, and it IS misleading. Thryduulf gave us the perfect example: "I know next to nothing about the subject area, and when I've looked up taxinomic names there seems to be no logic to whether the name I've heard of is a species, family or whatever". Now, imagine if he/someone searches a species name and gets a genus article, that's even MORE confusing, and misleading.<br/>+<br/>+:Sorry this was so long --[[User:TheAlphaWolf|TheAlphaWolf]] 01:15, 8 July 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::TheAlphaWolf, I'd like to address the procedural points you've just raised.<br/>+<br/>+::# You say that the admin need not be a taxonomist because the person adding the tag can supply the taxonomical knowledge. However, this will not do as the admin must be able to verify that the tag has been applied correctly. <br/>+::# You ask how, without this rule, non-admins (I'm not an admin either) can get these redirects deleted.  The answer is that you should list them on [[Wikipedia:Redirects for deletion]].

But CSD is not the way to solve this. It requires a good knowledge of taxonomy, sometimes even a specialized knowledge of a small branch of taxonomy. However, there is an easy solution. There are several admins working within the ToL (I'm such an admin myself). This problem can perhaps be solved with a special list on the talk page of ToL, that would alert those admins and prompt them into action (by deleting or, even better, by writing the much needed article, or ask a specialist in the field to write the article). Anyway, this is too complicated to be handled  as a CSD. [[User:JoJan|JoJan]] 08:43, 9 July 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:Hmm, a special list... sounds good to me. It would make it much easier. --[[User:TheAlphaWolf|TheAlphaWolf]] 19:01, 9 July 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+I can't see an argument for deleting lower taxon redirects, much less speedily deleting them.  What would be the point of making accurate information about the higher taxon more difficult to access? --[[User talk:Tony Sidaway|Tony Sidaway]] 19:35, 9 July 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+And the idea of lower taxa redirects, of which AlphaWolf seems to approve, makes my head hurt; which lower taxon should the redirect point to? [[User:128.112.207.249|128.112.207.249]] 21:23, 9 July 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+I think this is not a case for speedy. As Tony says, it is likely that people may know the name of the lower order species and they may wish to search for that. Redirects are (almost) free, and as long as people are not abusing the redirect service with an extreme number of these redirects, the ones that are there should be fine. This issue is more appropriate on a Science/Biology Wikiproject.

I often work on [[WP:RFD|RfD]] and there are far to many cases of votes being done on cross namespace redirects like [[Articles for deletion]] → [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion]]. I think does should be rapidly deleted so the user does not have to fill out the whole rfd2 template. Also, many users do not know about the rules about cross namespace redirects and make them, this will help eliminate cross namespace redirects (which get numerous delete votes on rfd anyway, one request was, "'''delete'' this and all other cross namespace redirects.")

Indeed, comments there indicate that a "mistakenly created" necessity is inappropriate for Wikipedia and even legally invalid under the GFDL because the author retains copyright ownership over what he writes.

If the Wikimedia Foundation received a letter asking for removal of an article with only that one author, I think they would honor it. Also, this is not merely a legal matter. As said previously, Wikipedia should not be a "trap" and should honor requests to remove text added by one author. The problem is that, read literally, the current criterion would mean that an administrator must verify that it was created mistakenly, in the same way that an administrator must verify that a text is a copyright violation or that it was a recreation of deleted material. —[[User:Centrx|Centrx]]→[[User talk:Centrx|''talk'']]&nbsp;&bull; 01:44, 13 July 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::I also disagree with the proposal in the strongest terms.

Looking through the archives, it looks like the general consensus overall is that the criterion needs to be loosened a bit, but should not apply to all copy-paste articles or to all copyright infringements. However, with the growth of Wikipedia, it may be that copyright infringements only rarely get refactored into articles.

A possible, but complicated compromise is to say that any copy-paste that is just plain not notable should be speedy deleted, regardless of whether it asserts notability.

This would avoid the nuisance of anons persistantly re-adding such images and even removing the speedy tag.  It removes the need for people to "baby sit" the article and image while awaiting deletion. Of course users can re-upload such images, but anons can't, so this rule would have some positive effect.  I suggested this in the past, but now that images are undeleable, I see no reason not to do this now.  Replacing fair use with free images seems to be hopelessly slow process, filled with silly revert warring that's a total waste. <br/>+<br/>+p.s.

If the unwieldiness of [[WP:CP]] and [[:Category:Possible copyright violations]] is the problem, there are at least a couple of alternatives or combinations to resolve this: 1) Copyright violations could be dated and categorized like PROD is, see [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard#Dated categories for Deletedpages and Copyright violations]]; 2) the waiting time for copyright problems could be reduced, to say 3 or 5 days, which is far longer than the minutes or hours a CSD candidate gets before deletion; 3) copyright problems with claims of ownership could be dealt with more summarily with claims that are unsubstantiated or for users that don't respond within a couple days. —[[User:Centrx|Centrx]]→[[User talk:Centrx|''talk'']]&nbsp;&bull; 04:37, 19 July 2006 (UTC)<br/>+:How about making the amendment a bit stronger, like "Material is copied from a website with an obvious copyright notice that is unquestionable not compatible with Wikipedia."

However, to pour some cold water on the notion of making all copyvios speedier than PRODs, there have been at least a large number of cases where the copyright owner has only come back to check on their masterpiece a few days later. Shortening its delay to 48 hours is too much by far; not all our users live, eat and drink Wikipedia and while a lot can happen in 48 hours if one is very plugged in here, it is much shorter a time to people with less engagement in Wikipedia.

One admin shouldn't decide alone, if there's no possible use for an image (here or on Commons).  I would be open to the idea of allowing speedies of image spamming (e.g. "the 10 pictures of themselves" example above).  Also, if there's doubt whether an image is actually free, and its orphaned, then that should be speedied.  But I just don't think we're being swamped with definatively free images, and so I see little need for speedying them.  --[[User:Thivierr|Rob]] 03:14, 27 July 2006 (UTC)<br/>+**This is one of those things where WikiCommonSense needs to be used.  If someone uploads 50 worthless images for their advertisement, there's no reason that the closing administrator shouldn't just delete the images along with the ad.  Requiring that they be tagged, the uploader notified, and possibly (depending on the license) the images listed at IFD is nothing but a pointless exercise in wasting time.  If we had lots of people patrolling images and inappropriate images were quickly deleted, I'd agree with you, but as it is, it takes a really long time for something improper to get noticed and removed.  Check out [[Special:Uncategorizedimages]].  There are images in there that were uploaded months ago that are unsourced, unlicensed, unused, yet sitting happily undisturbed.  Either Orphanbot missed them or, in many cases, the uploader just blanks Orphanbot's warnings.  Until such time as there are enough image patrollers to cope with the number of images, we need tools like this CSD to help take some of the workload.

If someone creates an article about a person or group and their assertion of notability is vague, i.e. the band is really popular, or the band has a big following, or the person is a well respected individual or the individual has written some books, without really citing the books themselves, who the publisher is (to show they're not self-published), and if its questioned the article should be deleted. On regular articles if content is added without proper citation it can and is often removed until reasons are given for its inclusion in the article. I see no reason it should be any different for created articles. Obviously easily verifiably famous people don't need citations (though likely most articles have already been created), but anyone who is borderline should have some proper assertion of notability per WP:BIO or WP:BAND that can easily be verified by any editor and if it can't then send it to the grave until such a time that the person wants to properly establish notability. As for wording...most admins should be familiar with WP:BIO and WP:BAND so something along the lines of "''The author does not assert credible notability per guidelines. In the case of borderline individuals or groups this should be presented in the form of external references''". (I also think A7 should be expanded to cover any catagory that has accepted notability guidelines, but that is probably another discusison). I don't think this is unreasonable and I don't the admins should err on the side of caution. Don't get rude about it, but politely point them to the notability guidelines and ask them to resubmit the article per those guidelines. If they can't be bothered than the article probably wouldn't have been that good or useful anyway. If the subject is notable, it shouldn't be a huge issue to get those references.

If it wasn't a junk article and this was a genuine attempt to create a useful article, it gives the admin, or someone else the opportunity to interact with a new user, welcome them, explain the way things work, and mentor them a bit with the creation of the article.

I have no problem politely discussing policy and how to write an article with a new person, I've done it more than once with someone I was only a few minutes before at odds with who was repeatedly removing speedy and Afd tags from the article. Is there not an online resource for the OBE that could be easily verified, and if not, then yes it could be sent to AfD if the assertion seemed plausible, and if thats the assertion the article was based on. Maybe its not a difference of wikiphilosophies so much as I'm not completely explaining what I have in mind here. As I stated below I'm not saying we require 10 references to even consider keeping an article. I'm saying that that if the article makes a vague claim make a small effort to check up on it first, google it or ask the creator for clarification, etc. Explain the need for clarification of the notability. Don't err so far on the side of caution.  if they make a specific claim, i.e. "Sara won the United States Open in 1983", again make a cursory attempt to check up on it, however I think there should be a stipulation that if the person who puts it up for speedy or AfD if the admin removes the speedy, can prove the claim false, i.e. they find the official website which says the winner was indeed Larry, it should be removed on the spot, rather than sitting it out in AfD. I'm not saying every unsubstantiated claim should be removed on the spot. Claims that are vague and have no substantiation should be looked at more critically than specific claims. I could write an article about a guy and make the assertion that he's an author and runs a nationwide company. An admin might turn around and say "Hey thats an assertion, take it to AfD" but a 2 second google search may have revealed the book was self-published and the company consits of him, his dog, and a potted plant he found in a dumpster.--[[User:Crossmr|Crossmr]] 07:22, 2 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+::We don't want to dump our problem on AfD by shipping it off there because we don't want to be bothered to check the assertion ourselves.

(I just made up the names). Yet notability is asserted and it would have to sit on AfD for 5 days. That's a pretty obvious case, and I'm sure some admin when presented with the evidence would speedy it, but you're shifting the way wikipedia works from inside the article and article creation.

A single admin handling speedy deletion likely does not have the time to fully research each and every speedy deletion candidate. Speedy deleting without conducting such research would result in too many false positives of the type Centrx described above. [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion/Proposal/1]] and its talk page contain more on these issues. [[User:Christopher Parham|Christopher Parham]] [[User talk:Christopher Parham|(talk)]] 06:40, 30 July 2006 (UTC)<br/>+::::plausible is an awfully subjective word. Its also easy to make a plausible claim without it being true. I'm still at a loss as to why the burden has been shifted in the case of article creation to the person who wants it removed and not the person who wants it included. Yet once the article is created any further information to be added the burden goes on that person who wants it included. That shift isn't explained here anywhere at all. I also don't think the admin needs to research each and every case. Why not have the person nominating for speedy explain in full detail the reasoning as to why the individual or band isn't really notable. The admin reads the assertion in the article (which they need to do anyway) then reads the counter-argument. If it makes sense delete it and leave a template inviting the individual to read the guidelines, ensure the individual/group is notable, and resubmit it with a proper assertion per those guidelines. It might take a few more seconds per speedy tag for them to read the counter-argument, but I'm sure someone could whip up an automated tool that would delete the page and automatically leave a template on the original author's talk page.--[[User:Crossmr|Crossmr]] 15:56, 30 July 2006 (UTC)<br/>+:::::Actually, the standard is more or less the same in both cases. Implausible, unlikely, or derogatory statements that do not have sources can be removed, either by speedy deletion in the case of a new article or by excision from any other article. Other unsourced statements are usually dealt with less agressively -- by PROD or AFD for a new article or by, say, adding a {{tl|fact}} tag in other articles. These methods are intended to bring problems to wider attention so they can be fixed.

Any current band/person should have a google prescence of some sort. Its not a blanket criteria for all articles, common sense has to come into this and obviously its likely to be a lot more difficult to prove notability about a 200 year old music trio, than the latest garabge band.

A disputed, unsourced statement can be removed from an article and this is allowed.  So, it is within the letter of the law to first remove the dubious clame and ''then'' speedy delete the resultant article that has no assertion of significance.  However we should not expect admins to jump thru silly hoops like this when the result is the same.  I do speedy deletes quite frequently of things that probably don't exactly match a CSD, and so far there's been no controversy.  No amount of written rules are a good substitute for human judgment. [[User:Friday|Friday]] [[User talk:Friday|(talk)]] 16:00, 31 July 2006 (UTC)<br/>+:Which is nice that you do it, but my example about the band above illustrates the other side of the coin, where the band specifically said they had no commercial success but were "pretty popular in their little hometown" (paraphrased). There was obviously no way they were going to satisfy WP:BAND and made no assertion per those guidelines, but there was "an assertion of notability" (even though the notability was far from enough for an article here), and thus an admin sent it to AfD (where it was later deleted). However, I've seen more than one AfD where an article which clearly doesn't meet the threshold for inclusion was kept here because a few interested invididuals were able to muddle the discussion into "no concensus" and the closing admin didn't bother to look at the validity of the arguments and just said "Oh there is an equal amount on both sides give or take, lets just keep it". You essentially have a formula for getting an article kept here by at first making a vague claim to notability then getting a handful of buddies together (as most AfDs don't get massive attention) and muddling the discussion and hoping you get an admin who just tallies it up rather than reads it.--[[User:Crossmr|Crossmr]] 19:59, 31 July 2006 (UTC)<br/>+::But you overlook the criterion of frequency. "More than one" is not a preponderance of AfDs. Unless you really think there are so many articles of this type being AfD'ed that AfD can't handle them all, there's no reason to propose an expansion of this rule. And speedy deletion is not a method of overriding a keep vote - if such articles are kept, that is not evidence of the need for a CSD, but evidence that there should ''not'' be one. [[User:Deco|Deco]] 20:34, 31 July 2006 (UTC)<br/>+:::AfD regularly has backlog issues, so sending more articles there because of vague claims isn't really a good idea.  And abuse of the system is exactly a reason there should be a little more oomph to this criterion. I regularly come across articles that people have tried to delete in the past when it was absolutely clear the "keep" side had no basis for its argument but the admin never bothered to actually read those arguments and just did it as a vote.  I'm not going to start making a list, but I've seen good closing admin and I've seen bad closing admin.  I've seen closing admin who actually read the arguments and the article and even with a majority "keep" remove the article because they've recognized the keep side had no basis for their point.  I've also seen closing admin completely ignore the arguments where you have delete people saying "it violates this policy, this policy, this policy, fails for inclusions here here and here" and the keep people saying "I like this article, its pretty", and the closing admin claims no concensus and thats it.  By not giving this criterion any teeth that means we now have to turn around and submit this to a third process (where usually good sense prevails) of deletion review. I see no reason why we can take the position that non-notable or unsourced information can be immediately removed from an article and put the burden on the person who wants it included to prove its worthyness, yet have a non-notable article have to potentially go through 3 processes to be removed because we're worried there might have been some notability  to the subject. As I've pointed out some admin have taken this carefulness to the extreme, by saying even vague claims should be taken to AfD even if its obvious the claim woudln't meet the guidelines anyway. Also if the subject really IS notable, the original creator should have no issue providing that or even if they don't want to, a notable individual should have more than one person out there who wants to come to wikipedia to write about them.--[[User:Crossmr|Crossmr]] 22:21, 31 July 2006 (UTC)<br/>+:::and remember, AfD is supposed to be a discussion, not a vote, even though some treat it like that.

I'm not saying admins should automatically delete any article they see with db-bio or db-band on it, just take more care in ensuring the claim is remotely plausible before removing it and telling people to take it to AfD. I'm not saying we need 10 references and a dna sample to keep an article, but the assertion should be notable, it should be plausible, and if you can't verify the claim via a quick google search, perhaps ask for a little more info from either the original author or the person who put the tag on it. Heck maybe even a new tag to the effect of "This speedy deletion is currently under review" if you need a few minutes to verify the info. We're not in a race and if handling the article takes a few minutes of multi-tasking rather than a few seconds, I doubt wikipedia is going to collapse. On the other hand it ensures we're not needlessly shoving articles off to AfD.--[[User:Crossmr|Crossmr]] 22:36, 31 July 2006 (UTC)<br/>+::::Why not use [[WP:PROD]]?

Therefore, I did not actually see anyone stating what you would call non-consensus. I do not see how your arguments rebutt what the others said either.

The closing admin will normally have enough knowledge to know that Billy isn't President of the World (and hence delete), but even for them, something more obscure may make it difficult to know what is 'plausible'. A fair percentage of cases that go to AFD could probably be handled under A7, but they end up there because people don't know how to apply A7. Personally I'd like to see A7 go and be replaced by ''better'' prod guidelines: allowing you to prod it if you think it fails policies or guidelines regardless of whether it is likely to be contested, and making removal without comment a breach of policy.

I can't see that I'd be saved from hoaxes anyway(nonsense is of course covered by the perfectly sensible A1). There seems to be no reason for A7 to be speedy other than the fact that we don't want a lot of 'slam dunk' AFDs and prod is inadequate: it's not something that needs to be taken down quickly  for legal reasons.

I asked Jimbo on his talk page (since I3 is a policy from him) but I think now it might be better to have a discussion with others.  Okay; here's the issue.  A lot of "fair use" images, as part of their rationale, say "in the absence of a free alternative" or something similar.  The thing is, because of CSD I3, we basically reject entirely any images that would be free for Wikipedia to use, but which are not "free+" in the sense that they aren't GFDL-compatible.  So, what if an image was being used under a fair use claim, and a "with-permission" alternative existed, although not a "free+" one?  It seems to me, that would invalidate the fair use claim, as an alternative exists that would be free to use.  If this is the case, we need to either reconsider I3 or our fair use policy.

(In fact, since the institution of [[Template:Permission from license selector]], they do, and it gets speedied.) "GFDL" and "Creative Commons" still have a somewhat "mystical" feel for users and they don't tend to use them, or maybe it's just because the permission slot is earlier in the drop-down, I don't know.

I see a procedural problem with such a template since CSD-eligible articles can be (and frequently are) deleted on sight by any admin.  I'm not sure, but I suspect the issue is deletion under A7, without any warning, of "good faith" creations by editors who simply don't know the rules.  [[WP:CSD]] already says (2nd paragraph) ''Users nominating a page for speedy deletion should specify which criteria the page meets; it would also be considerate to notify the original author — remember, [[Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers|everyone was new once]].''  Perhaps we should create [[template:CSDWarning]] and [[template:CSDNote]] (as a new pair of [[Wikipedia:Template messages/User talk namespace#Deletion notifications|deletion notifications]]) not for the intent of warning about impending deletions, but ''to notify the original author'', particularly "new" users, what might have happened to their article in cases that could even charitably be considered "good faith".  Comments about this? -- [[user:Rick Block|Rick Block]] <small>([[user talk:Rick Block|talk]])</small> 15:51, 6 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+:I think that would be an excellent addition, as long as they're easy to type and remember, e.g: ((sdna#|PAGENAME)) = Speedy Deletion Notice Attack-page (which would also include the text from ((test#)), ((sdne|PAGENAME)) for Speedy Deletion Notice Empty page (perhaps adding text saying that if they were going to add material to the article after creating it, they should include at least some content in the original version, and mark it with ((stub))), etc. --[[User:SB_Johnny|<font color="green">'''SB_Johnny'''</font>]] | <sup>[[User talk:SB_Johnny|<font color="green">talk</font>]]</sup> 16:15, 6 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+:If A7 is a problem, we should discuss refining or excluding it from CSD. Changing the whole system will just confuse users, as by the time they likely read it, the page will be gone. It's different for AFD/IFD, where there's some question and debate to be had about the deletion. If a speediable page gets deleted, it can be recreated (if appropriate) in non-speediable form.

Of course, there are exceptions, particularly for some of the more debatable criteria such as A7. If you're thinking of adding a caveat that articles that have passed AfD cannot be speedied, I would support this - the point of CSD is to decrease load on AfD, and in this case the price is already paid. If the keep was based on premature nomination and conditional on improvement, it might be speediable, but they should probably renominate it. [[User:Deco|Deco]] 17:39, 6 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+::That's exactly what I'm thinking of doing.

The only other criteria I can see as having any real chance of being applied to a kept article are G9 and A8, and either would overrule an AfD result anyway (we can't keep a copyvio just because some Wikipedians voted for it, while Office Actions overrule everything here.) For the other criteria...<br/>+:::*A valid A1, A2, or A3 will never pass AfD, while someone making an invalid speedy deletion using those clear-cut criteria isn't going to stop just because you threw some more red tape at them.  If by some freak accident a valid A1-A3 speedy candidate ever ''does'' pass an AfD, we'll be in a situation so bizarre that extra verbage on this page is unlikely to matter much one way or the other; whatever strange, unforeseeable circumstances could bring that situation about would have to be dealt with as they arise.  <br/>+:::*A4 doesn't exist.<br/>+:::*A5 only applies when invoked by an AfD, so it doesn't matter here.<br/>+:::*A6 could theoretically be disputed, but in practice the definition of 'attack pages' is narrow and clear enough to lump it in with A1-A3, above.  The fact that the only major discussion of A6 in recent memory has been its duplication into I8 shows this.<br/>+:::*A8, as noted, would have to overrule an AfD keep.<br/>+:::The only thing that might be worth having is a slight rewording on A7 to clarify the fact that AfD results should be used instead of A7 when an article's classification is disputed (which would plainly be the case if it had been contested when it came up on AfD!)  I do not think that this is necessary, however, and I cannot see your proposed new rule being useful in any other case. --[[User:Aquillion|Aquillion]] 22:30, 7 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+==G4 on redirects==<br/>+The present G4 means that a deleted redirect can never be reconsidered; contrary to [[WP:NBD]]; since there is no way to make a ''different''  redirect from A to B. [[WP:DRV]] will not reconsider, since applying G4 to a recreated redirect, even if it is recreated as a result of popular demand a year later, is still ''proceedurally'' correct. I suggest the following language:<br/>+:''To avoid [[WP:NBD|irreversible decisions]], G4 shall not apply to redirect recreated more than 90 days after deletion.

For starters, if G4 overruled a DRV consensus to undelete as you say, then DRV could only undelete articles if they were substantially changed. That's not the case - DRV can undelete articles without them being substantially changed if the deletion was improper. Has there ever been a case of a redirect staying deleted per G4 when it clearly shouldn't have been, or is this an instruction-creeping solution in search of a problem? --[[User:Samuel Blanning|Sam Blanning]]<sup>[[User talk:Samuel Blanning|(talk)]]</sup> 23:53, 7 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+:::No, the problem is that, under present phrasing, all such speedies are proper.

[[User:Pmanderson|Septentrionalis]] 02:36, 8 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+I don't know that I like that idea.  I fully believe that, for example, cross-namespace redirects of essential Wikipedia pages are a good idea, but I don't want us to have to argue about the issue every three months. [[User:BigDT|BigDT]] 01:08, 8 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+:The problem now is that if a redirect is ever deleted, even by three or four discussants, it can be (legitimately) speedied every time anybody ever recreates it. (And under the proposal, we only have to discuss them if A recreates one ''and'' B RfD's it; i.e. if there is still disagreement on the matter.) Would adding "recreated by a different user" answer your objections? [[User:Pmanderson|Septentrionalis]] 02:34, 8 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+"Recreated by a different user" is easy to get around - think sock puppets.  Is there actually a specific case where this has been a problem?  I've got to think that if there is consensus among the editors of article Xyz that, though six months ago the redirect was deleted, it is now a meaningful redirect, and the conversation is referenced on the redirect page, no administrator is going to delete it.  On the other hand, having a particular waiting period set out for recreation is only going to [[WP:BEANS]] someone into recreating their favorite pet redirects every three months. How about solving the problem by spelling out in the criterion, "this clause also does not apply to deletions overturned at [[Wikipedia:Deletion review|Deletion review]]."  That way, there's a catch all in there just in case someone wants to Wikilawyer. [[User:BigDT|BigDT]] 02:53, 8 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+*I don't understand what the problem is here.  If something changes to suddenly make it a good idea to overturn the deletion of a redirect (which, given the nature of redirects, would include a sudden increased demand for that redirect), that would count as "new information", and the original deletion could therefore be challenged on DRV, no matter how old it might be...  although common sense says that in 'obvious' cases, DRV should only be consulted when someone objects to the restoration by requesting that the new redirect be deleted under G4.  In that case, you've got an old RfD result that is, essentially, being disputed again over allegations of new information; I don't see how it could go anywhere ''but'' DRV. If nothing at all has changed since the redirect's deletion... why are you challenging it? You cannot challenge an ?fD of any sort just because you don't like its results; that's universal to the ?fD system. AfDs don't prevent the creation of substantially different versions, yes, but that's because it's ''possible'' to have substantially different versions, which would mean the old AfD reasoning might not apply...  the fact that that doesn't apply to redirects is by design, not an accident. The fact that RfDs remain valid until new information arises is entirely inherent in the nature of redirects, so suggesting that we 'solve' it by having RfDs periodically expire on an arbitrary timescale makes no sense. --[[User:Aquillion|Aquillion]] 05:38, 8 August 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+== Suggested change in R2 ==<br/>+<br/>+A [[WP:CNR|proposal]] has been made which involves modifying the R2 criterion.

However, your criteria would include Klingon because some people have learnt to speak it, even though this is more due to the fact that it's part of the Star Trek cult than its inherent artistic merit, and exclude (what I consider to be) better conlangs whose creators are happy for their language's speakers to remain fictional.<br/>-<br/>-Pete Bleackley<br/>-<br/>-* This conlang criteria won't let any conlangs through. All it will allow on Wikipedia will be auxlangs. Hence why I disagree that they should be used. [[User:Cctoide|Cctoide]] 11:38, 28 July 2005 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-* It's worth noting that some conlangs have Private Use segments carved out for their invented scripts (see the [[http://www.evertype.com/standards/csur/ Unicode ConScript Registry]]). Should this factor into these criteria? [[User:ThomasWinwood|ThomasWinwood]] 11:57, July 28, 2005 (UTC)<br/>-:: I don't think so - the ConScript Registry is not any sort of official registry, it's just two people (I think, correct me if I'm wrong) and whatever gets submitted to them.  Every single one of Herman Miller's languages is in there, for instance, and I don't think all of those are notable.

[[User:Almafeta|Almafeta]] 13:19, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</i><br/>-I agree that the current conditions are a little auxlang-oriented. But I am glad that Almafeta is at least trying to establish some objective criteria. Currently everybody can just shout "notable" or "non-notable" at will, and therefore I genuinely think we nééd those criteria badly. <br/>-:<i>Agreed!  Right now, conlang articles and conlang VfDs are going around without rhyme or reason.</i><br/>-A few remarks:<br/>-<br/>-<u>Number of speakers</u>: like the others said, this can apply only to languages that were designed with the purpose of being spoken. In other words, IALs. True, there are some artistic languages that have some speakers, too. But IMO the number of Klingon speakers says as much about the importance of Klingon as the number of sold Star Trek T-shirts about the importance of [[Star Trek]]. Nobody can of course be sure, but a huge number of those people have learnt the language nót because they think it is important, or because they want to communicate in it, but because they are Star Trek fans. Another thing is that the "number of speakers" is terribly hard to establish: where do you get the info, and how well must a person speak the language for being qualified as a "speaker"?<br/>-:<i>Not necessarially.  Conlangs like Verdurian, Mango, and Talossan were created with one person in mind:  the creator.  Good conlangs attract speakers like good games attract players, even if they were designed with 'one person' in mind.</i><br/>-:<i>Also, Klingon is notable for other reasons.  Heck, how many other conlangs have translations of the Bible and Hamlet?</i><br/>-::Sorry, but I have to disagree with that. That's like judging a good poem by the number of times it has been recited in public. Some conlangers (including myself, I should add) simply don't WANT their languages to be actually used by other people. For measuring an auxlang, the number of speakers/users is valid; but in the case of artlangs, the equivalent would rather be the number of people who have "consumed" it, and who appreciate it. [[User:IJzeren Jan|IJzeren Jan]]<br/>-<br/>-:::How do you measure the consumption of an artlang? A poem's notability could be judged by its publication, sales of the work in which it was published, its inclusion in anthologies, the existance of critical analysis... what criteria can be used to establish the notability of a language that is not intended to be spoken? -[[User:Satori|Satori]] 23:32, 28 July 2005 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-<u>Books with ISBN numbers</u>: that's an dangerous one. There has been a period when the world was rather susceptible to the idea of a world language. All kinds of authors started building something Esperanto-like and could easily find a publisher to publish there ideas. Nowadays, I think such a thing is virtually impossible, especially when the subject is not an IAL but an artlang. Why would a publisher publish such a think if he knows in advance that he won't sell a huge number of copies? Even Tolkien couldn't manage such a thing; only now books are written about his conlangs.<br><br/>-Furthermore, nowadays we have the Internet.

As for minimum length, see below where I propose a minimum corpus size as one of the minor criteria. --[[User:Jim Henry|Jim Henry]] | [[User talk:Jim Henry|Talk]] 22:05, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</i><br/>-<br/>-<u>Older than usual</u>: I can live with that.

I'm not asking him to disclose the algorithms he uses, but I would like to know how useful in his opinion the result is; how easily one could manipulate the outcome; and in how far the outcome is influenced by people who might be looking for something completely different (I noticed for example that languages like "Gothic", "New English" and my own "Hattic" always score well, and I suspect that it because their names attract a lot of googlers). If you are reading this, Jeffrey, tell us this: if someone would, purely theorically, have a conlang called "Vagina". Would it become part of the Top-10, and if so, how quickly? <br/>-<br/>-<u>Mistaken for a real language</u>: By whom? When? Where? I have a website about Hattic, a naturalistic conlang with an entire quasi-history; it is never mentioned that the whole thing is fictional, and indeed I have stumbled upon people who thought the whole thing was real. But that is merely the result of how a language is presented, not how significant it is.<br/>-:<i>Some conlangs have been confused for real languages by governments or universities.  (There was a big bruhaha when a professor 'discovered' a 'lost' Romance tongue, when it turned out to be just some Euroclone.)</i><br/>-<br/>-<u>Caused controversy</u>: Frankly, I think the whole current set of VfDs regarding Brithenig, Verdurian, Wenedyk and others can be considered controversy too, isn't it?<br/>-:<i>I mean outside of Wikipedia.  'Causing controversy' is a general rule for inclusion in any article, but </i><br/>-<br/>-<u>ISO code</u>: I don't really know the mechanisms behind ISO 639-3. But I have seen the list of conlangs listed there, and my impression is that someone just picked a few conlangs from the Internet during a spare few minutes. The list hasn't changed at all since a number of years, and I also noticed that the list contains both [[Ceqli]] and [[Tceqli]], which as far as I know is exactly the same language (or perhaps the same language in two different stages of its development).<br/>-<br/>-<u>Wikipedia</u>: Question is: how does a language get a Wikipedia? Again, it seems to me that the number of users is decisive here. And even then, the whole thing seems to be rather prone to politicising (see the story of the Toki Pona wikipedia). <br/>-:<i>Languages get Wikipedias by (1) having a large number of active speakers and (2) not annoying Jimbo Wales (see Toki Pona for a case in point, as you said).</i><br/>-<br/>-<u>My point of view</u>: I think the most of the conditions Almafeta mentions can indeed '''contribute''' to a language's notability. But I can't accept that a language that does not fulfill them is therefore to be considered non-notable. Note for example that a language like [[Parseltongue]] wouldn't survive these points either, and undoubtedly many more languages wouldn't. What I miss is therefore some criteria that might apply specifically to conlangs of the artistic genre, like:<br/>-*Has this language influenced others?<br/>-*:<i>Good one...  perhaps it would count as a major qualification if it influnced a language that was made notable with a major qualification, and a minor qualification if it counted as a language that was made notable with a minor qualification?</i><br/>-:::And what if two languages influenced each other? :))) [[User:IJzeren Jan|IJzeren Jan]]<br/>-*How complete is the language?

In the case of Verdurian, even though Mark Rosenfelder developed it over a large span of time, there aren't many speakers.

A key point here is that of permanence - how long has a conlang been around? If a conlang appears on Monday and disappears on Friday, obviously not enough time has passed for the language to be developed.<br/>-:I suggest therefore that the limits for conlang articles be set as extensiveness of lexicon, completion of phonology and morphology (a highly subjective distinction; I shall bring the topic up on a conlang forum and see what emerges there) and notoriety outside its "foster" environment (for [[Verdurian]], for instance, the foster environment is the Zompist.com domain and accompanying IRC chat and forum).

Right now, my guidelines aren't good enough for those sorts of languages.  (For example, if we made a notability criteria having a certain number of words -- such as the often-quoted 2,500 words needed to achieve conversational fluency in English -- we'd ignore languages like Basic English, Toki Pona, and Baza, all of which are designed to work around an extremely restricted set of words.)<br/>-<br/>-Does anyone have a good idea what would make one of the four above types of conlang notable?  [[User:Almafeta|Almafeta]] 18:26, 28 July 2005 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-:Well, [[Loglan]] is notable for being a test of [[Sapir-Whorf]] and for being the most agressively logical conlang, and [[Quenya]] is notable because of the notability of [[Lord of the Rings]].  I'm not sure whether Eklektu or Toki Pona are notable. [[User:DenisMoskowitz|DenisMoskowitz]] 18:36, 2005 July 28 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-:: I would argue that any language with as many speakers as Loglan, Lojban or Toki Pona is notable regardless of its other characteristics.  As I mentioned elsewhere, I think the minimum number of speakers should be set far lower than 500, arguably lower than 50, especially for languages that aren't designed to be regular and/or easy.  Further down the page there is some discussion about "completeness" criteria (how thoroughly the phonology, grammar, semantics are defined; how large a corpus exists in the language; etc) that would apply to artlangs (and [[Engineered language|engelangs]] like [[Ithkuil]]) that may be too difficult to attract learners.  Influence on other conlangs is a criteria that applies well to artlangs and engelangs as well. --[[User:Jim Henry|Jim Henry]] | [[User talk:Jim Henry|Talk]] 21:09, 28 July 2005 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-::: Agreed.

[[User:IJzeren Jan|IJzeren Jan]] 21:38, 28 July 2005 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-:::: I agree, in the sense that an artlang (or engelang) may merit inclusion in Wikipedia even if it has no fluent speakers at all (even the creator) and has not been used in professionally published/broadcast fiction/media -- if it is complete enough (see discussion below) and there is some evidence that it is well known or influential on other conlangers.  However, I think having some speakers besides the creator is a ''plus''; an artlang that just barely merits inclusion based on its completeness, fame, influence, etc., would be pushed over the edge into definite notability by having some speakers besides the author (even if only 10 or 20).  We might do this with a structure similar to Almafeta's minor criteria: at least four of these criteria for expressivity/completeness, or at least three of those criteria plus at least 10 speakers other than the creator and friends. --[[User:Jim Henry|Jim Henry]] | [[User talk:Jim Henry|Talk]] 22:00, 28 July 2005 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-:::::Agreed on all accounts!

Yes, the way it looks now it is too simple (and too auxlang-oriented) and definitely deserves refining. But on the other hand, I don't think we do our "cause" much good if we turn it into an algorithm that is so complicated that hardly anyone can crack it. --[[User:IJzeren Jan|IJzeren Jan]] 09:24, 30 July 2005 (UTC)  <br/>-<br/>-:Besides, how do you verify a language's number of speakers?

Ability to read and write at asynchronous speeds would suffice, because it's easy to verify online.  For Toki Pona, for instance, we can point to a mailing list where a fair amount of the traffic is in the conlang itself (not just about it) and the number of people posting in the language is significant.  --[[User:Jim Henry|Jim Henry]] | [[User talk:Jim Henry|Talk]] 22:00, 28 July 2005 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-::: I definately think traffic on a message board by a number of speakers in different locales would establish a certain amount of notability.

For instance, in judging a language's completeness, neither thoroughly defined phonotactics, nor thoroughly defined grammar, nor a largish lexicon, are enough by themselves to make a language complete; you really need all three; but the existence of a sizable corpus and/or several speakers besides the creator demonstrates completeness even if the phonology is vaguely defined and the lexicon looks sparse.  -- Or maybe one of the minor criteria could be "completeness", which itself has several criteria (at least 3 out of of 4 or 5 completeness sub-criteria must be met, to meet the minor criterion of "completeness")?  That was almost coherent...  In short, among the various minor criteria some will deserve more weighting than others; any two of the weightier criteria will establish notability, or any three or more of the less weighty.  Does that make sense?  Or does it complicate things too much?  I should get some sleep before I post again. --[[User:Jim Henry|Jim Henry]] | [[User talk:Jim Henry|Talk]] 02:05, 29 July 2005 (UTC)<br/>-::I would just say "having a through grammar" would be what we would vote on, and (assuming it is adopted) coming back to define what a 'complete grammar' is in the future in case that it becomes important to define what, exactly, a conlang's grammar should be capable of.  [[User:Almafeta|Almafeta]] 17:13, 29 July 2005 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-==General Discussion==<br/>-What about notability?  Would a conlang that's trying to do something interesting and unique be notable despite lack of completion?  (Though notoriety outside its environment might cover this.) [[User:DenisMoskowitz|DenisMoskowitz]] 17:21, 2005 July 28 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-We could set some criteria about completeness of the language's description - lexicon size, whether a certain list of basic questions about its grammar and phonology are answered, etc.  I would also propose a minimum corpus size criterion: are there multiple texts written in the language, with some significant total wordage.  A language with several thousand words in its lexicon may not really be very complete if the only text available is a few sample sentences in the grammar document, and maybe the Tower of Babel story or the Lord's Prayer.  On the other hand, a language designed for lexical parsimoniousness should not be penalized for its small lexicon, if the amount of text written in the language proves that this language is more powerful than its small lexicon would suggest.  Corpus size counts extra if some significant part of was written by people other than the creator of the language.<br/>-<br/>-I would also suggest that the minimum number of speakers in Almafeta's criteria should be reduced.  500 speakers are certainly plenty to prove notability, but I think 50 are plenty even without one of the other "minor" criteria; having even 10 or 20 speakers is pretty notable for a naturalistic conlang that was not designed (like most auxlangs) to be easy to learn. --[[User:Jim Henry|Jim Henry]] | [[User talk:Jim Henry|Talk]] 17:37, 28 July 2005 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-:I guess that depends on the definition of notablity, which I grant is somewhat of an "eye of the beholder" problem.  However, let's say I create a board game.  I don't get it published or distributed.  Me and 20 or so of my friends play it from time to time.  If I created a wikipedia article about it, it would likely (and rightly IMO) be deleted.  Or take a more common hobby, such as music.  We routinely delete articles on non-notable local bands, even though some of them probably have 20-50 people who know about them and see them from time to time at a pub or cafe.  Furthermore, I don't speak [[Klingon language|Klingon]], [[Ido]], or [[Westron]], but I've ''heard'' of them.  Of course, just as there are hundreds of notable, record-contracted, hit-making bands I've never heard of, I'm sure there are many conlangs I've never heard of that are still notable in some way.  I think [[user:Almafeta|Almafeta]]'s criteria are a good standard for establishing that notability.  -[[User:Satori|Satori]] 18:06, 28 July 2005 (UTC)<br/>-::Well...  I don't.  That's why I started this discussion.  ^^;  [[User:Almafeta|Almafeta]] 18:26, 28 July 2005 (UTC)<br/>-:::Perhaps I should have said, they're a good start. -[[User:Satori|Satori]] 18:40, 28 July 2005 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-:: OK... I see your point.  Theoretically a language could have 10-20 speakers and still be extremely obscure, with scarecely anyone having heard of it outside its speaker community and their close friends.  Still, in a minor criteria section of a policy (at least two of these properties, or at least three of these properties...) maybe a minimum of 10 speakers ''outside of the creator's close friends'' would make sense.  Various minima for how complete the language is could also go in that minor criteria section.  For instance, a grammar that treats of all the points on the [http://lingweb.eva.mpg.de/fieldtools/linguaQ.html Lingua Questionnaire]; a thorough phonology description that treats of allophony and related issues; a lexicon of at least 2,500 words; a corpus of at least 25,000 words in the language by the creator, or at least 5,000 words in the language by people other than the creator. (Feel free to shoot at these specific numbers.) --[[User:Jim Henry|Jim Henry]] | [[User talk:Jim Henry|Talk]] 21:26, 28 July 2005 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-::: My main problem with "outside of the creator's close friends" is that could be hard to define, on its face.  How do you verify, say, in a VfD discussion, who the speakers are and what their relation to the creator is?  The minima on completeness surely helps.  But what are the factors of a conlang that would lead to someone outside that circle of friends to use it?  Those factors are probably indicators of notability. -[[User:Satori|Satori]] 21:33, 28 July 2005 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-:I originally had them at 10 and 100, not 50 and 500; however, this made the possibility of a conlang that is only spoken by one family (or one D&D group for that matter) being considered 'notable'.  I arbitrarially bumped the numbers of speakers up by fivefold to make it require more speakers than the creator's closest friends.  [[User:Almafeta|Almafeta]] 18:26, 28 July 2005 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-::Perhaps "notoriety outside of foster environment" would work here - spoken by 10 people outside of the creator and gang. [[User:DenisMoskowitz|DenisMoskowitz]] 18:43, 2005 July 28 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-I would like to note that #almea and the KutjaraWiki are not managed by or linked by any way to zompist. #almea hardly ever discusses Verdurian, and the Wiki is not run by Mark. [[User:Cctoide|Cctoide]] 18:23, 28 July 2005 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-FWIW, "notability" is an ever-elusive thing.  Given the various motives people have for creating languages, from auxiliary languages, artistic languages, and cryptographic languages, I am not sure that we need a policy here that can be applied like an algorithm.  I would prefer that conlang articles speak for themselves: if a language can be described in terms that make it "interesting" enough, and if the article that is written about it shows some sophistication and is otherwise encyclopedic, I would generally vote to allow such articles to remain.

For this reason I suggest the following:<br/>-* Lexicon size (say, larger than 500 or 1000) - subject to reviewal by a panel composed of other conlangers (nobody can review a conlang better than another conlanger, although in the panel should be representatives of auxlang, loglang, artlang etc. communities). A lexicon is not something which biases towards any one type of conlang, so it's a fair review of the span of a conlang.<br/>-* Translation of an approved text - this should demonstrate semantic, lexical and grammatical completion. To be decided by the same conlang panel. Again, doesn't bias in favour of any type of conlang.<br/>-* Finally, the whim of the conlang panel should be given priority, to eliminate objection. The conlang panel's decision is final.<br/>-<br/>-It might also be worth siphoning off all conlangs into a separate project. Then Wikipedia can simply block all conlangs, including Klingon and Atlantean and the rest. [[User:ThomasWinwood|ThomasWinwood]] 17:59, July 31, 2005 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-:Well Thomas, your suggestions are interesting, but I can't say I agree with them. <br/>-:First of all, lexicon size. Frankly I think 500 or 1000 is far too little. Look [http://www.langmaker.com/db/mdl_index_lexiconsize.htm#500 here] and convince yourself: we'd end up with far too many language. A number of 2000 or 2500 mentioned earlier would work better IMO.<br/>-:Then your idea of a panel. I like that idea. But your idea that "the conlang panel's decision is final" is impossible to carry out. Wikipedia simply doesn't work like that! No, a panel of a few knowledgeable people that can give trustworthy advise would be A Good Thing, and I'd happily be part of it. But its decision can never be final!<br/>-:Translation of an approved text. This is going much too far IMO. As if inclusion in Wikipedia was a primary target for the average conlanger! No, counting characters in texts in the conlang, that's one thing; picking "mandatory" texts to translate, that's another thing.<br/>-:I don't really understand what you mean by "a separate project". You mean, something outside Wikipedia? Remember, there are already several conlang wikis around. If that's really what you propose, that's about the same as one massive VfD against áll conlangs represented here, something I'd strongly oppose!<br/>-:Best regards, [[User:IJzeren Jan|IJzeren Jan]] 20:14, 31 July 2005 (UTC)<br/>-::Isn't the idea of Wikipedia to have a reference that is of use to the interested non-specialist?  Then, it would seem to me, that [[Wikibooks]] is the proper place for a textbook on the conlang, or for commentary that is of interest to specialists, and Wikipedia the proper place for summary articles that are informative to a wider readership.  [[User:Robert A West|Robert A West]] 03:02, 1 August 2005 (UTC)<br/>-:::Sure, I agree with that. Conlang articles definitey should not contain detailed grammatical descriptions (although some basic classificational info certainly won't hurt). That's what websites are for.

Much of the discussion here has centered around the lack of verifiability for many articles about artlangs due to the fact that no one has written about them except their authors; this is partly due to the fact that the zines devoted to conlangs died long ago and for the last few years we've had pretty much only the mailing lists and Zompist Bulletin Board as venues for discussion of conlangs, which don't serve quite the same purpose as a journal publishing in-depth articles (like Rick Harrison's ''Journal of Planned Languages''). <br/>-<br/>-: It would make sense to publish the original research on various artlangs there in the conlang wikicity, and at some point later, if it seems warranted, do articles at Wikipedia for the most notable of them. --[[User:Jim Henry|Jim Henry]] | [[User talk:Jim Henry|Talk]] 23:11, 3 August 2005 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-::Sounds good to me.

It consists of an infinite,  regular grid of ''cells'', each in one of a finite number of ''states''.  The grid can be in any finite number of dimensions.  Time is also discrete, and the state of a cell at time ''t'' is a function of the states of a finite number of cells (called its ''neighborhood'') at time ''t-1''. These neighbors are a selection of cells relative to the specified cell, and do not change. (Though the cell itself may be in its neighborhood, it is not usually considered a neighbor.) Every cell has the same rule for updating, based on the values in this neighbourhood. Each time the rules are applied to the whole grid a new ''generation'' is produced.<br/>+{{Template:US City infobox|<br/>+ city = Rockville|<br/>+ state = Maryland |<br/>+ nickname = |<br/>+ motto = |<br/>+ flag = Rockville md flag.gif |<br/>+ seal = Rockville md seal.gif|<br/>+ map = MDMap-doton-Rockville.PNG |<br/>+ map size = |<br/>+ map cap = Location in [[Maryland]]|<br/>+ founded = c.

Rockville has a [[sister city]] arrangement with [[Pinneberg]], [[Schleswig-Holstein]], [[Germany]].<br/> <br/>-One example of a cellular automaton (CA) would be an infinite sheet of graph paper, where each square is a cell, each cell has two possible states (black and white), and the neighbors of a cell are the 8 squares touching it.  Then, there are 2<sup>9</sup> = 512 possible patterns for a cell and its neighbors.  The rule for the cellular automaton could be given as a table.  For each of the 512 possible patterns, the table would state whether the center cell will be black or white on the next time step. This is an example of a two dimensional cellular automaton. See [[Conway's Game of Life]] for the most popular CA of this form.<br/>+==History==<br/>+[[Image:Beall dawson house.jpg|thumb|right|Beall-Dawson House, on West Montgomery Avenue near Rockville Town Center, was built in 1815.  The home was owned by Upton Beall, Clerk of the Montgomery County Court.]]<br/>+[[Image:Rockville railroad station.jpg|thumb|right|[[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] station in Rockville.]]<br/>+Situated in the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] region and crossed by three [[Creek (stream)|creek]]s (Rock Creek, Cabin John Creek, and Watts Branch), Rockville provided an excellent refuge for semi-[[nomadic]] [[Native Americans of the United States|Native Americans]] as early as [[8000 BC]]. By the [[first millennium BC]], a few of these groups had settled down into year-round [[agricultural]] communities that exploited the native flora, including [[sunflower]]s and marsh elder. By [[1200]] AD, these early groups (dubbed ''Montgomery Indians'' by later [[archaeologists]]) were increasingly drawn into conflict with the [[Senecas]] and [[Susquehannock]]s who had migrated south from [[Pennsylvania]] and [[New York]]. Within the present-day boundaries of the city, six prehistoric sites have been uncovered and documented, and borne artifacts several thousand years old. By the year [[1700]], under pressure from [[Europe]]an colonists, the majority of these original inhabitants had been driven away.<br/> <br/>-It is usually assumed that every cell in the universe starts in the same state, except for a finite number of cells in other states, often called a ''configuration''.  More generally, it is sometimes assumed that the universe starts out covered with a periodic pattern, and only a finite number of cells violate that pattern.  The latter assumption is common in one-dimensional cellular automata.<br/>+The first land patents in the Rockville area were obtained by Arthur Nelson between [[1717]] and [[1735]]. Within three decades, the first permanent buildings in what would become the center of Rockville were established on this land. Still a part of [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's County]] at this time, the growth of Daniel Dulaney's [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick Town]] prompted the separation of the western portion of the county, including Rockville, into [[Frederick County, Maryland|Frederick County]] in [[1748]].<br/> <br/>-[[Image:Torus.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A torus, a toroidal shape.]]<br/>-Cellular automata are often simulated on a finite grid rather than an infinite one.  In two dimensions, the universe would be a rectangle instead of an infinite plane.  The obvious problem with finite grids is how to handle the cells on the edges. How they are handled will affect the values of all the cells in the grid. One possible method is to allow the values in those cells to remain constant. Another method is to define neighbourhoods differently for these cells. You could say that they have fewer neighbours, but then you would also have to define new rules for the cells located on the edges. These cells are usually handled with a ''toroidal'' arrangement: when you go off the top, you come in at the corresponding position on the bottom, and when you go off the left you come in on the right. (This essentially simulates an infinite periodic tiling.) This can be visualized as taping the left and right edges of the rectangle to form a tube, then taping the top and bottom edges of the tube to form a [[torus]] (doughnut shape).  Universes of other dimensions are handled similarly. This is done in order to solve boundary problems with neighborhoods. For example, in a 1-dimensional cellular automaton like the examples below, the neighborhood of a cell ''x<sub>i</sub><sup>t</sup>''&mdash;where ''t'' is the time step (vertical), and ''i'' is the index (horizontal) in one generation&mdash;is {''x''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub><sup>''t''&minus;1</sup>, ''x''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>''t''&minus;1</sup>, ''x''<sub>''i''+1</sub><sup>''t''&minus;1</sup>}. There will obviously be problems when a neighbourhood on a left border references its upper left cell, which is not in the cellular space, as part of its neighborhood!<br/>+Being a small, unincorporated town, early Rockville was known by a variety of names, including '''Owen's Ordinary''', '''Hungerford's Tavern''', '''Daley's Tavern'''. The first recorded mention of the settlement which would later become known as Rockville dates to the [[Braddock Expedition]] in [[1755]]. On [[April 14]], one of the approximately two thousand men who were accompanying General [[Edward Braddock]] through wrote the following: "we marched to larance Owings or Owings Oardianary, a Single House, it being 18 [[miles]] and very dirty." Owen's Ordinary was a small rest stop on Rock Creek Main Road (later '''Rockville Pike'''), which stretched from [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|George Town]] to [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick Town]], and was then one of the largest thoroughfares in the colony of Maryland. <br/> <br/>-==History of cellular automata==<br/>-[[Stanislaw Ulam]], while working at the [[Los Alamos]] National Laboratory in the 1940s, studied the growth of crystals, using a simple [[lattice network]] as his model.  At the same time, [[John von Neumann]]&mdash;Ulam's colleague at Los Alamos&mdash;was working on the problem of [[self-replicating system|self-replicating systems]].  Von Neumann's initial design was founded upon the notion of one robot building another robot.  This design is known as the kinematic model.  As he developed this design, von Neumann came to realize the great difficulty of building a self-replicating robot, and of the great cost in providing the robot with a "sea of parts" from which to build its replicant.  Ulam suggested that von Neumann develop his design around a mathematical abstraction, such as the one Ulam used to study crystal growth.  Thus was born the first system of cellular automata.  Like Ulam's lattice network, von Neumann's cellular automata are two-dimensional, with his self-replicator implemented algorithmically.     The result was a [[universal copier and constructor]] (UCC) working within a CA with a small neighborhood (only those cells that touch are neighbors; for von Neumann cellular automata, only [[orthogonal]] cells), and with 29 states per cell.  Neumann proved mathematically that a particular pattern would make endless copies of itself within the given cellular universe.  This design is known as the [[tessellation]] model.<br/>+On [[September 6]], [[1776]], the Maryland Constitutional Convention agreed to a proposal introduced by Dr. Thomas Sprigg Wootton wherein Frederick County, the largest and most populous county in the Maryland, would be divided into three smaller units. The southern portion of the county, of which Rockville was a part, was named Montgomery County. The most populous and prosperous urban center in this new county was [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|George Town]], but its location at the far southern edge rendered it worthless as a seat of local government. Rockville, a small, but centrally located and well travelled town, was chosen as the seat of the county's government. Thereafter, the village was referred to by all as '''Montgomery Court House'''.<br/> <br/>-In the [[1970s]] a two-state, two-dimensional cellular automaton named [[Conway's Game of Life|Game of Life]] became very widely known, particularly among the early computing community. Invented by [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]], and popularized by [[Martin Gardner]] in a ''[[Scientific American]]'' article, its rules are as follows: If a black cell has 2 or 3 black neighbors, it stays black.  If a white cell has 3 black neighbors, it becomes black.  In all other cases, the cell stays or becomes white.  Despite its simplicity, the system achieves an impressive diversity of behavior, fluctuating between apparent randomness and order.  One of the most apparent features of the Game of Life is the frequent occurrence of ''gliders'', arrangements of cells that essentially move themselves across the grid. It is possible to arrange the automaton so that the gliders interact to perform computations, and after much effort it has been shown that the Game of Life can emulate a universal [[Turing machine]]. <br/>-Possibly because it was viewed as a largely recreational topic, little follow-up work was done outside of investigating the particularities of the Game of Life and a few related rules.<br/>+In [[1784]], William Prather Williams, a local landowner, hired a surveyor to lay out much of the town. In his honour, many took to calling the town '''[[Williamsburgh]]'''. In practice, however, Williamsburgh and Montgomery Court House were used interchangeably. On [[July 16]], [[1803]], when the area was officially entered into the county land records, however, the name used was "Rockville," believed to be derived from [[Rock Creek]]. Nevertheless, the name Montgomery Court House continued to appear on maps and other documents through the [[1820s]].<br/> <br/>-In [[1969]], however, [[Konrad Zuse]] published his book ''[[Calculating Space]]'', proposing that the physical laws of the universe are discrete by nature, and that the entire universe is just the output of a deterministic computation on a giant cellular automaton. This was the first book on what today is called [[digital physics]]. <br/>+By petition of Rockville's citizens, the [[Maryland General Assembly]] incorporated the village on [[March 10]], [[1860]]. General  George B. McClellan stayed at the Beall Dawson house in 1862. During the [[American Civil War]], General [[J.E.B. Stuart]] and an army of 8,000 [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[cavalry]]men marched through and occupied Rockville on [[June 28]], [[1863]] while on their way to [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]],and stayed at the Prettyman house. [[Jubal Anderson Early]] had also crossed through Maryland, on his way to and from his attack on Washington.<br/> <br/>-In [[1983]] [[Stephen Wolfram]] published the first of a series of papers systematically investigating a very basic but essentially unknown class of cellular automata, which he terms ''elementary cellular automata'' (see below). The unexpected complexity of the behavior of these simple rules lead Wolfram to suspect that complexity in nature may be due to similar mechanisms.  Additionally, during this period Wolfram formulated the concepts of intrinsic randomness and computational irreducibility, and suggested that [[rule 110]] may be [[Turing-complete|universal]]&mdash;a fact proved as part of the development of his later book.<br/>+In [[1873]], the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] arrived, making Rockville easily accessible from [[Washington, D.C.]] In [[July 1891]], the '''Tenallytown and Rockville Railway Company''' inaugurated Rockville's first [[trolley]] service, and in [[1900]], the '''Washington and Rockville Electric Railway Company''' extended its trolley service from Georgetown to Rockville, connecting Rockville to Washington, DC by trolley. Trolley service operated for four decades, until, eclipsed by the growing popularity of the [[automobile]], service was halted in [[August 1935]]. The '''Blue Ridge Transportation Company''' provided bus service for Rockville and Montgomery County from [[1924]] through [[1955]]. After 1955, Rockville would not see a concerted effort to develop a [[public transportation]] infrastructure until the [[1970s]], when the [[Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority]] (WMATA) began work to extend the [[Washington Metro]] into Rockville and extended Metrobus service into Montgomery County. The Rockville station of Washington Metro was opened on [[December 15]], [[1984]]. Metrobus service was supplemented by Montgomery County's own '''Ride On''' bus service starting in [[1979]].<br/> <br/>-Wolfram left academia in the mid-late [[1980s]] to create [[Mathematica]], which he then used to extend his earlier results to a broad range of other simple, abstract systems. In [[2002]] he published his results in the 1280-page text ''[[A New Kind of Science (book)|A New Kind of Science]]'', which extensively argued that the discoveries about cellular automata are not isolated facts but are robust and have significance for all disciplines of science.  Despite much confusion in the press and academia, the book did not argue for a fundamental theory of physics based on cellular automata, and although it did describe a few specific physical models based on cellular automata, it also provided models based on qualitatively different abstract systems.<br/>+From the [[1960s]], Rockville's town center, formerly one of the area's commercial centers, suffered from a period of decline. Attempts to revitalize interest in the region culminated in the unsuccessful [[Rockville Mall]] which failed to attract either major [[retailers]] or customers, and was demolished in [[1994]]. Although efforts to restore the town center continue, the majority of the city's economic activity has since relocated along [[Rockville pike|Rockville Pike]] (MD Route 355/Wisconsin Avenue).  In [[2004]], Rockville Mayor [[Larry Giammo]] announced plans to renovate the Rockville Town Center, including building new stores and housing and relocating the city's library.<br/> <br/>-==The simplest cellular automata==<br/>-The simplest nontrivial CA would be one-dimensional, with two possible states per cell, and a cell's neighbors defined to be the adjacent cells on either side of it.  A cell and its two neighbors form a neighborhood of 3 cells, so there are 2<sup>3</sup>=8 possible patterns for a neighborhood.  There are then 2<sup>8</sup>=256 possible rules.  These 256 CAs are generally referred to using a standard naming convention invented by Wolfram.  The name of a CA is the decimal number which, in [[binary numerical system|binary]], gives the rule table, with the eight possible neighborhoods listed in reverse counting order.  For example, below are tables defining the "rule 30 CA" and the "[[Rule 110 cellular automaton|rule 110 CA]]" (in binary, 30 and 110 are written 11110 and 1101110, respectively) and graphical representations of them starting from a 1 in the center of each image:<br/>-It is silly to use Mathematica to model CAs. <br/>+The grave site of [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] is located at St. Mary's Church, in the center of Rockville, and there is a small theater, next to '''Glenview Mansion''' in the Civic Center Park, named after him.  In addition, a new arts center and theater, named '''Strathmore Hall''', opened in [[2005]].

These figures are an increase from the earlier [[2000]] census, which cited a total population of 47,388 people, 17,247 housholds, and 12,003 families residing in the city.<br/> <br/>-A number of papers have analyzed and compared these 256 CAs.  The rule 30 and rule 110 CAs are particularly interesting.  <br/>+The [[population density]] is 1,360.3/km&sup2; (3,524.1/mi&sup2;).  There are 17,786 housing units at an average density of 510.6/km&sup2; (1,322.7/mi&sup2;).  The racial makeup of the city is 67.78% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 9.11% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.34% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 14.83% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.03% [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 4.78% from [[Race (U.S. Census)|other races]], and 3.13% from two or more races.  11.67% of the population are [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race.<br/> <br/>-Rule 30 generates apparent randomness despite the lack of anything that could reasonably be considered random input. Wolfram proposed using its center column as a [[pseudorandom number generator]] (PRNG); despite occasional claims to the contrary, it passes every standard test for randomness, and Wolfram uses this rule in the Mathematica product for creating random integers. (In particular, in the [[1990s]] a cryptography survey book claimed that rule 30 was equivalent to a [[linear feedback shift register]] (LFSR), but in fact the claim was about rule 90.) Although Rule 30 produces randomness on many input patterns, there are also an infinite number of input patterns that result in repeating patterns. The trivial example of such a pattern is the input pattern only consisting of zeros. A less trivial example, found by [[Matthew Cook]], is any input pattern consisting of infinite repetitions of the pattern '00001000111000', with repetitions optionally being separated by six ones.<br/>+There are 17,247 households out of which 33.0% have children under the age of 18 living with them, 56.6% are [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 9.5% have a female householder with no husband present, and 30.4% are non-families. 23.8% of all households are made up of individuals and 8.9% have someone living alone who is 65 years of age or older.  The average household size is 2.65 and the average family size is 3.13.<br/> <br/>-Rule 110, like the Game of Life, exhibits what Wolfram calls ''class 4'' behavior, which is neither completely random nor completely repetitive. Localized structures appear and interact in various complicated-looking ways. In the course of the development of ''[[A New Kind of Science (book)|A New Kind of Science]]'', Cook proved in [[1994]] that these structures were rich enough to support universality. This result is interesting because rule 110 is an extremely simple one-dimensional system, and one which is difficult to engineer to perform specific behavior.  This result therefore provides significant support for Wolfram's view that class 4 systems are inherently likely to be universal.  Cook presented his proof at a [[Santa Fe Institute]] conference on Cellular Automata in [[1998]], but Wolfram blocked the proof from being included in the conference proceedings, as Wolfram did not want the proof to be published before the publication of ''A New Kind of Science''.  In [[2004]], Cook's proof was finally published in Wolfram's journal [http://www.complex-systems.com Complex Systems] (Vol. 15, No. 1), over ten years after Cook came up with it.<br/>+In the city the population is spread out with 23.4% under the age of 18, 7.0% from 18 to 24, 32.1% from 25 to 44, 24.4% from 45 to 64, and 13.1% who are 65 years of age or older.  The median age is 38 years.  For every 100 females there are 95.2 males.  For every 100 females age 18 and over, there are 92.2 males.<br/> <br/>-==Reversible cellular automata==<br/>-A CA is said to be ''reversible'' if for every current configuration of the CA there is exactly one past configuration ([[preimage]]). If one thinks of a cellular automaton as a function mapping configurations to configurations, reversibility implies that this function is [[bijective]].<br/>+The median income for a household in the city as of 2003 is $73,275. As of 2000, the median income for a family was $79,051. Males have a median income of $53,764 versus $38,788 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the city is $30,518.  7.8% of the population and 5.6% of families are below the [[poverty line]].  Out of the total population, 8.9% of those under the age of 18 and 7.9% of those 65 and older are living below the poverty line.<br/> <br/>-For one dimensional CA there are known algorithms for finding [[preimage|preimages]], and any 1D rule can be proved either reversible or irreversible. For CA of two or more dimensions it has been proved that the reversibility is [[undecidable]] for arbitrary rules. The proof by [[Jarkko Kari]] is related to the tiling problem by [[Wang tile|Wang tiles]].<br/>+==Law and government==<br/>+===Mayor or City Executive===<br/>+The current Mayor of Rockville is '''Larry Giammo.'''

Such CA have rules specially constructed to be reversible. Such systems have been studied by [[Tommaso Toffoli]], Norman Margolus and others.<br/>+===Representative body===<br/>+Rockville has a four-member City Council, whose members, along with the Mayor, serve as the legislative body of the city. The Council members for the 2005 to 2007 session are Susan Hoffmann, Bob Dorsey, Phyllis Marcuccio, and Anne Robbins.<br/> <br/>-For finite CAs that are not reversible, there must exist patterns for which there are no previous states.  These patterns are called ''[[Garden of Eden pattern]]s''.  In other words, no pattern exists which will develop into a Garden of Eden pattern.<br/>+==Colleges and universities==<br/>+*[[Montgomery College]] (Rockville Campus) (a 2-year institution)<br/>+*[[University of Maryland University College]] (a 4-year institution); main campus in [[Adelphi, Maryland]]<br/>+*[[Johns Hopkins University]] ([http://www.mcc.jhu.edu/ Montgomery County Campus]) (a 4-year institution); main campus in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]<br/> <br/>-Several techniques can be used to explicitly construct reversible cellular automata with known inverses.  Two common ones are the [[second order cellular automaton|second order technique]] and the [[block cellular automaton|partitioning technique]], both of which involve modifying the definition of a cellular automaton in some way.  Although such automata do not strictly satisfy the definition given above, it can be shown that they can be emulated by conventional CAs with sufficiently large neighborhoods and numbers of states, and can therefore be considered a subset of conventional cellular automata.<br/>-<br/>-==Totalistic cellular automata==<br/>-A special class of CAs are ''totalistic'' CAs. The state of each cell in a totalistic CA is represented by a number (usually an integer value drawn from a finite set), and the value of a cell at time ''t'' depends only on the ''sum'' of the values of the cells in its neighborhood (possibly including the cell itself) at time ''t''&minus;1.  If the state of the cell at time ''t'' does depend on its own state at time ''t''&minus;1 then the CA is properly called ''outer totalistic'', although the distinction is not always made.  [[Conway's Game of Life]] is an example of an outer totalistic CA with cell values 0 and 1.<br/>-<br/>-==Uses in cryptography==<br/>-Rule 30 was originally suggested as a possible [[stream cipher]] for use in [[cryptography]]. <br/>-<br/>-Cellular automata have been proposed for [[public key cryptography]].  The [[one way function]] is the evolution of a finite CA whose inverse is hard to find.  Given the rule, anyone can easily calculate future states, but it is very difficult to calculate previous states.  However, the designer of the rule can create it in such a way as to be able to easily invert it.  Therefore, it is a [[trapdoor function]], and can be used as a public-key cryptosystem.  The security of such systems is not currently known.<br/>-<br/>-==Related automata==<br/>-There are many possible generalizations of the CA concept.<br/>-<br/>-One way is by using something other than a rectangular (cubic, ''etc.'') grid.  For example, if a plane is [[tiling|tiled]] with equilateral triangles, those triangles could be used as cells.<br/>-<br/>-Also, rules can be probabilistic rather than deterministic.  A probabilistic rule gives, for each pattern at time ''t'', the probabilities that the central cell will transition to each possible state at time ''t''+1.  Sometimes a simpler rule is used; for example: "The rule is the Game of Life, but on each time step there is a 0.001% probability that each cell will transition to the opposite color."<br/>-<br/>-The neighborhood or rules could change over time or space. For example, initially the new state of a cell could be determined by the horizontally adjacent cells, but for the next generation the vertical cells would be used.<br/>-<br/>-The grid can be finite, so that patterns can "fall off" the edge of the universe.<br/>-<br/>-In CA, the new state of a cell is not affected by the new state of other cells. This could be changed so that, for instance, a 2 by 2 block of cells can be determined by itself and the cells adjacent to itself.<br/>-<br/>-There are ''[[continuous automaton|continuous automata]]''. These are like totalistic cellular automata, but instead of the rule and the states being discrete (''e.g.'' a table, using states {0,1,2}), continuous functions are used, and the states become continuous (usually values in [[unit interval|[0,1]]]). The state of a location is a finite number of real numbers. Certain cellular automata can yield diffusion in liquid patterns in this way.<br/>-<br/>-Other automata are described as being "continuous", where these have a continuum of locations. The state of a location is a finite number of real numbers. Time is continuous, and the state evolves according to differential equations.  One important example is [[reaction-diffusion]] textures, differential equations proposed by [[Alan Turing]] to explain how chemical reactions could create the stripes on [[zebra]]s and spots on leopards.  When these are approximated by cellular automata, the CAs often yield similar patterns.<br/>-<br/>-==Cellular automata in nature==<br/>-[[Image:Textile cone.JPG|thumb|left|250px|''Conus textile'' exhibits a cellular automata pattern on its shell]]<br/>-Patterns of certain [[seashell]]s, like the ones in ''[[Cone snail|Conus]]'' and ''[[Cymbiola]]'' genus, are generated by natural cellular automata. The [[pigment]] cells reside in a narrow band along the shell's lip. Each cell [[secretion|secretes]] pigments according to the activating and inhibiting activity of its neighbours, obeying a natural version of a mathematical rule. The cell band leaves the colored pattern on the shell as it slowly grows. For instance, the widespread species ''[[Conus textile]]'' bears a pattern resembling the Rule 30 CA described above.<br/>-<br/>-Plants regulate their intake and loss of gases by using a cellular automaton model, each [[Stomata|stoma]] on the leaf acting like a cell.<br/>-<br style="clear:left;" /><br/>-<br/>-==Cellular automata in the chemistry lab==<br/>-The [[Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction]] is a spatio-temporal chemical oscillator which can be simulated by means of a cellular automaton. In the 1950s [[A. M. Zhabotinsky]] (extending the work of [[B. P. Belousov]]) discovered that when a thin, homogenous layer of a mixture of malonic acid, acidified bromate and a ceric salt were mixed together and left undisturbed, fascinating geometric patterns such as concentric circles and spirals propagate across the medium.  In the "Computer Recreations" section of the August 1988 issue of [[Scientific American]] Professor [[A. K. Dewdney]] presented a cellular automaton whose behavior closely resembles the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction.  (Dewdney's rules, and a modified version of them, are given [http://www.hermetic.ch/pca/algorithms.htm#bz1 here].)  These rules involve several parameters, and experiment reveals that the spirals of the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction occur only when values of these parameters are within a certain fairly narrow range.  Whether the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction actually occurs as the result of a cellular automaton at the molecular level is not yet known.<br/>-<br/>-==Articles on specific cellular automata==<br/>-* [[Conway's Game of Life]]<br/>-* [[Day & Night]]<br/>-* [[HighLife]]<br/>-* [[Immigration (CA)|Immigration]]<br/>-* [[Langton's ant]]<br/>-* [[QuadLife]]<br/>-* [[Seeds (CA)|Seeds]]<br/>-* [[Wireworld (CA)|Wireworld]]<br/>-* [[Rule 110 cellular automaton|Rule 110]]<br/>-<br/>-====Cellular automata designed to enable self-replication====<br/>-* [[Byl's loop]]<br/>-* [[Chou-Reggia loop]]<br/>-* [[Codd's Cellular Automaton]]<br/>-* [[Evoloop]]<br/>-* [[Langton's loops]]<br/>-* [[SDSR loop]]<br/>-* von Neumann's [[Universal Constructor]]<br/>-<br/>-==See also==<br/>-* ''[[A New Kind of Science]]''<br/>-* [[Bootstrapping]]<br/>-* [[Excitable medium]]<br/>-* [[Oscillator (CA)|Oscillator]]<br/>-* [[Spaceship (CA)|Spaceship]]<br/>-* [[Puffer train (CA)|Puffer train]]<br/>-* [[Reflector (CA)|Reflector]]<br/>-* [[Lights Out (game)]]<br/>-<br/>-== References ==<br/>-*[http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/toc.html Online access to the complete A New Kind of Science] with full searching, 30,000+ links,... <br/>-*[http://www.wolframscience.com/reference/notes/876b "History of Cellular Automata"] from [[Stephen Wolfram]]'s ''A New Kind of Science'' <br/>-*[http://cafaq.com/ Cellular automaton FAQ] from the newsgroup comp.theory.cell-automata<br/>-*[http://cell-auto.com/neighbourhood/index.html Neighbourhood survey] includes discussion on triangular grids, and larger neighbourhood CAs.<br/>-* von Neumann, John, 1966, ''The Theory of Self-reproducing Automata'', A.

The movie also claims that all the buildings came down at near free-fall speed and that, therefore, the official story that the buildings pancaked is impossible without breaking the laws of physics.<br/>+<br/>+==="Flight 93"===<br/>+* Suggests that [[United Airlines Flight 93]] did not crash in rural [[Shanksville, Pennsylvania]] but actually landed safely at [[Cleveland Hopkins Airport]] where it was evacuated by government personnel into an unused [[Glenn Research Center|NASA research center]].  Uses photographs and eye-witness reports of the crash site as evidence, suggesting that they show a lack of debris or severity of damage to site, a corresponding evacuation at Cleveland Hopkins Airport due to another hijacked plane and the corresponding reports, oddities in the transcripts of cell-phone calls supposedly placed from the plane during the hijacking, and the sighting of the tail number of Flight 93 on an aircraft in use at a later date.<br/>+<br/>+==="Oddities"===<br/>+* Asserts that cellular phone calls could not be made from American Airlines flights at the time of the crash. The film cites as evidence a later system installed in American Airlines planes which allowed the reception of cellular signals within the planes.  It questions why such a system would be needed if cellular transmissions were already possible within commercial airliners.<br/>+* Suggests that [[cell phone]] calls from passengers and crew were faked using sophisticated voice-morphing technology developed by the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] in [[New Mexico]] and that the [[December 13]], [[2001]] video of [[Osama Bin Laden]] admitting guilt was also faked.<br/>+* Asserts that of the list of [[Aircraft hijacking|hijackers]] initially released by the government, many were not in the planes and were alive after September 11, 2001 and may even still be alive.<br/>+<br/>+==="Cui Bono"===<br/>+* Outlines possible motives for the attacks.<br/>+* Alleges that [[Larry Silverstein]] stood to benefit significantly from the destruction of the towers from an extensive insurance policy.<br/>+* Alleges that some investors engaged in [[insider trading]] with an apparent foreknowledge of the eventual destruction of the towers.<br/>+* Suggests that billions of dollars in gold bars were secretly transported away from the World Trade Center before the Twin Towers collapsed.<br/>+* Alleges that conservative think-tank, the [[Project for the New American Century]], whose members include [[Dick Cheney]], [[Donald Rumsfeld]], [[Jeb Bush]], [[Paul Wolfowitz]], and [[John R.

The authors have since acknowledged this error and apologized.<br/>+<br/>+The film suggests that there is a rumour claiming $167 billion in gold was stored in vaults beneath the World Trade Center, and that only $200 million of that amount was recovered. This amount would have exceeded the entire amount of U.S. gold reserves by approximately $67 billion, and would be about 56% of the world's gold reserves in September, 2001. In fact, all of the approximately $230 million in precious metals stored in the vaults beneath the WTC was recovered. [http://www.rediff.com/money/2001/nov/17wtc.htm]<br/>+<br/>+The film focuses on the wrong type of engine for Flight 77. Bollyn, the reporter of [[American Free Press]] that Loose Changes uses, had contacted the factory in Indiana which makes engines for small planes like the [[Cessna Citation]] and [[RQ-4 Global Hawk|Global Hawk]], rather than the plant in [[Quebec]] that overhauls the 757 engines or the factory in [[Derby, England]]. Loose Change implies 757's only have [[Pratt & Whitney]] engines made of [[steel]] and [[titanium]] alloy. This is incorrect, because the engines used in Flight 77 are [[Rolls-Royce]] engines. <ref>[http://www.ccdominoes.com/lc/lcg2.html#Engine%20rotor%20mystery? 9-11 Loose Change Second Edition Viewer Guide]</ref><br/>+<br/>+The film falsified a quote in order to claim that air traffic controllers at Dulles International Airport thought that Flight 77 was a military plane. The quote used to support that claim is, "The speed, the maneuverability, the way that he turned, we all thought in the radar room, all of us experienced air traffic controllers, that that was a military plane," O'Brien said. "you don't fly a 757 in that manner. It's unsafe,"[emhasis added].

It would allow the interior of the building to collapse first; so that debris, floors and [[elevator]]s could fall inside the tower and blow out windows ahead of the exterior collapse.<br/>+<br/>+While [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]]'s initial report concluded the floor trusses gave way and created a pan-cake effect; a comprehensive report by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]] concluded the [[Collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center#Collapse_of_the_two_towers|WTC collapse]] occurred because the columns failed first.

Murtha Johnstown-Cambria County, Flight 93 headed south and then east and began a steady descent from an altitude of over 20,000 feet (6&nbsp;100&nbsp;m) to less than 6,000 feet (1&nbsp;830&nbsp;m). <ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A41095-2001Sep16 A Sky Filled With Chaos, Uncertainty and True Heroism]</ref><br/>+<br/>+The documentary asserts cell phone calls could not be made from an airplane, and cites new cell systems being tested after 9/11 in planes as compelling evidence in support of that position. Though the film briefly mentions that calls can be and were made using the plane's installed GTE Airphones, it does not explore this further; especially noted as lacking is the ratio of calls placed with this system as opposed to cell phones, despite the fact that many of the cited calls were made using the in-flight phone system. Although cell phone calls are entirely possible at lower altitudes, it could cause interference with the airplane and ground based cell phone networks. <ref>[http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,121399,00.asp PCWorld.com] &ndash; In-Flight Cell Phone Systems Gain Altitude</ref> <ref>[http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/cell_air.html ConsumerAffairs.com] &ndash; In-Flight Cell Phone System<br/>+Survives Test Flight</ref> The new in-flight systems allows phones to work over the ocean and at lower power levels as the signals are relayed using a [[satellite]] uplink; making interference far less likely.

Many peopl said that offensive userboxes disparaged the appearance of neutrality.  Well, he removed the material, so he has shown the willingness to change.  He also is extremely interested in working with the backlog, which is something we desperately need.  As far as the critreria for opposing, well we disagree there.

He is noted for the discovery of particle [[spin (physics)]] and for his theory of x-ray absorption spectroscopy.  His theories include the Kronig and Penney model and the Kramers-Kronig relation.<br/> <br/>-'''Jonathan Taylor Thomas''' (born [[September 8]], [[1981]] in [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]] as Jonathan Taylor Weiss) is an [[United States|American]] [[actor]], sometimes nicknamed "'''JTT'''".  <br/>+[[image:kronig.jpg|thumb|Ralph Kronig]]<br/> <br/>-As a child, Thomas played Randall William Taylor on the popular television show ''[[Home Improvement]]''. He went on to voice Young Simba in [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]'s ''[[The Lion King]]'' and [[Pinocchio]] in ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]''. He remained with ''Home Improvement'' well into his teenage years. <br/>+==Background==<br/>+Ralph Kronig (later Ralph de Laer Kronig) was born in 1904 from American parents in Dresden Germany where he received his primary education.  He went to New York to study at Columbia University until 1925 where he was an assistant professor.<br/> <br/>-As Thomas got older, he earned a reputation as a teen heartthrob and was a leading cover boy on teen magazines.  In [[1998]], he starred in the [[Christmas]] comedy ''I'll Be Home for Christmas'', which although heavily hyped as his break into movies, was actually a commercial flop.  He also appeared in the movies ''Man of the House'', ''Tom and Huck'', ''Wild America'', ''Walking Across Egypt,'' ''Common Ground'' and ''Speedway Junky''. He had a guest role on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[sitcom]] ''[[8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter]]'' in early [[2004]], and appeared in the [[The WB Television Network|WB]]'s ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'' in [[2003]] and [[2004]].  <br/>+But he returned during that time regularly to Europe and paid  visits to the important centers for theoretical-physics research in Germany and Copenhagen. It was a time of great expansion in the development of [[quantum mechanics]], and that development was taking place in Europe. Kronig was privileged to be a young, brilliant physicist in that glory-day of 20th century theoretical physics, which made it possible for him to live and work among the great physicists of that era (Bohr, Heisenberg, Pauli, Kramers). <br/> <br/>-Thomas attended [[Harvard University]] and the [[University of St. Andrews]] in [[Scotland]] as a visiting student.<br/>+In 1925, when Kronig was a young Columbia University PhD who had spent two years studying in Europe, he first proposed electron "spin" in Copenhagen. [[Werner Heisenberg]] and [[Wolfgang Pauli]] immediately hated the idea. They had just ruled out all imaginable actions from quantum mechanics. Now Kronig was proposing to set the electron rotating in space. Pauli especially ridiculed the idea of spin, saying that "it is indeed very clever but of course has nothing to do with reality". Faced with such criticism, Kronig decided not to publish his theory and the idea of electron spin had to wait for others to take the credit.  Ralph Kronig, had come up with the idea of electron spin several months before Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit, however, most textbooks credit these two men with the discovery.<br/> <br/>-A vocal opponent of [[abortion]], Thomas has been very active in various [[pro-life]] activities and causes.<br/>+Ralph Kronig did not hold a grudge against Pauli for this turn of events.  In fact, Kronig and Pauli remained friends for many years into the future.  They exchanged many ideas in physics through letters. However, many have argued (especially Dutch physicists) that Pauli only received the Nobel Prize for his exclusion principle due to Kronig's theory of particle spin.<br/> <br/>-He has [[Jewish]] and [[Portuguese]] ancestry.<br/>+In 1927, Kronig returned to Europe and remained there working in different prominent centres of research: Copenhagen, London, Zürich (where for a year he was Pauli's assistant). Around 1930 he settled in the Netherlands: first in Utrecht, afterwards in Groningen. He was recognized internationally by then as a reknowned Theorist who corresponded with the leading characters of that time and made interesting contributions to quantum mechanics and the application of it particularly on the physics of molecules and molecular spectra, an area on which he was the expert of those days.<br/> <br/>-==External links==<br/>-*[http://www.jttonline.co.uk Jonathan Taylor Thomas website]<br/>-* {{imdb name | id = 0001795 | name = Jonathan Taylor Thomas }}<br/>-* {{nndb name|id=869/000025794|name=Jonathan Taylor Thomas}}<br/>-*[http://www.jtt-fanpage.de Jonathan Taylor Thomas Fanclub e.V.]<br/>+Earlier in Kronig's life he had encountered [[Ehrenfest]] who while visiting America had advised the young American physicist Ralph Kronig to visit Europe.

Pauli briefs in his papers on the finished results, but not on the long, often laborious way, which had led to them, and also not on incomplete attempts. A part of his work is only carried in a satisfying way in his extensive exchange of letters."    <br/>+<br/>+[[Werner Heisenberg]] in developing [[Quantum Mechanics]] involved Kronig in his seminal ideas of the theory.  In the beginning of May 1925, Heisenberg wrote three times to Ralph Kronig, with whom he had cooperated a little earlier in Copenhagen on the spectral theory of multi-electron atoms. In the second letter, dated 5 May, he wrote down in some detail equations expressing the transition to a new atomic theory.<br/>+<br/>+Stumm von Bordwehr (1989) gives a detailed description of the life and accomplishments of Kronig, even recounting how his name was changed to Ralph de Laer Kronig.<br/>+<br/>+==Scientific achievement==<br/>+Ralph Kronig (1931, 1932), published the first theory of x-ray absorption fine structure which contained some of the basic concepts of the modern interpretation. Kronig and Penney (1931) published a one dimensional model of a crystal that showed how the electrons in a crystal would be dispersed into allowed and forbidden bands by scattering from the extended linear array of atoms. His first theory (1931) of EXAFS was the three-dimensional equivalent of this model. The theory showed that a photo electron traversing a crystal lattice would experience permitted and forbidden zones depending on its wavelength and, that even when the effect was averaged over all directions in the lattice, a residual structure should be observed. It was successful in predicting many generally observed features of the fine structure, including similar structure from similar lattices, inverse r2 dependence , correct r versus T dependence and increasing energy separation of the fine structure features with energy from the edge. The equation which was re-derived in a more quantitative way in 1932 was simple to apply and interpret. Every experimenter found approximate agreement with the theory. There were always some absorption features close to that predicted by the possible lattice planes. However, the expected strong reflections (e. g. (100), (110), (111), etc. ) did not always correlate with the most intense absorption features as intuitively expected. Still, agreement was close enough to be tantalizing and everyone tested the agreement of their measured "Kronig structure" with the simple Kronig theory. In the Kronig equation, energy positions Wn correspond to the zone boundaries, i. e. not the absorption maxima or minima, but the first rise in each fine structure maximum. abg are the Miller indices, a is the lattice constant and q is the angle between the electron direction and the reciprocal lattice direction. When averaged over all directions with a non-polarized x-ray beam and a polycrystalline absorber, cos2q = 1. However, with a single crystal absorber and polarized x-rays the absorption features should be larger for specific crystal planes. This was another experimental variable that might verify the theory and many attempted to test it. Thus began the long record of publications in which Kronig structure was interpreted in terms of the simple Kronig theory. Until the 1970s fully 2% of the papers published in Phys. Rev. were devoted to x-ray absorption spectroscopy and most invoked Kronig's theory. <br/>+<br/>+The short range order data of Hanawalt (1931b) stimulated Kronig (1932) to develop a theory for molecules. This model served as the starting point for all the subsequent short range order theories but few attempted to compare it to their data. Kronig's student, H. Petersen (1932, 1933) continued this work. Peterson's equation shows many of the features of the modern theory. This theory was applied to GeCl4 by Hartree, Kronig and Petersen (1934). A description of the Herculean efforts required to perform the calculations can be found in Stumm von Bordwehr (1989).<br/>+<br/>+The Kramers–Kronig relation<br/>+Any satisfactory theory of dispersion must comply with the condition that the scattered wave can never appear in advance of the incident wave that produces it. Physicists Hendrick Anthony Kramers of The Netherlands and Ralph de Laer Kronig of Germany showed that this basic causality condition implies that the dispersion (i.e., the variation of refractive index with frequency) and the absorption are not independent. They derived equations enabling the absorption to be calculated when the dispersion is known (for all frequencies) and vice versa. It is not surprising that a relationship should exist, because dispersion and absorption are each related to the resonators described above in connection with scattering by bound electrons. The relationship has been found of great importance in many branches of pure and applied physics.<br/>+<br/>+==Books published by Ralph Kronig==<br/>+*Correspondence with Niels Bohr, 1924-1953.<br/>+*Textbook of physics.

It is a common misconception that inflation is a rise in consumer prices. Inflation corresponds with the decline in purchasing power of money relative to some basket of goods and services. In some models of economics, this is equivalent to a fall in the demand for, or an increase in the supply of [[money]]. Inflation is the opposite of [[deflation (economics)|deflation]].<br/>-<br/>-In some contexts the word "inflation" is used to mean an increase in the [[money supply]], which is sometimes seen as the cause of price increases. Thus, for example, some observers of the 1920s in the United States refer to "inflation" even though prices were not increasing at the time. Below, the word "inflation" will be used in the former way unless otherwise specified.<br/>-<br/>-Related terms are [[disinflation]] which is a reduction in the rate of inflation, or an effect which reduces inflationary pressures, [[deflation]] which is a fall in the general level of prices, [[reflation]] which is the use of stimulus to reverse deflation, [[hyperinflation]] which is a rapid period of inflation without tendency to equilibrium. Low levels of inflation, between 0% and 2% are sometimes called "[[price stability]]", and many [[central banks]] officially or unofficially have [[inflation targeting]] to maintain some preferred measure of inflation within this range.<br/>-<br/>-(See also [[macro-economics]], [[monetary policy]] and [[money supply]])<br/>-<br/>-== Measuring inflation ==<br/>-<br/>-Inflation is measured by measuring the aggregate money supply availaible to the market.  Inflation's effects can be measured by observing the change in the price of a large number of goods and services in an economy, usually based on data collected by government agencies.  The  prices of goods and services are combined to give a ''price index'' or ''average price level'', the average price of the basket of products. The [[inflation rate]] is the rate of increase in this index; while the price level might be seen as measuring the ''size'' of a balloon, inflation refers to the ''increase'' in its size.  <br/>-<br/>-There is no single true measure of inflation, because the value of inflation will depend on the weight given to each good in the index.  Examples of common measures of inflation include:<br/>-<br/>-* '''[[consumer price index]]es''' (CPIs) which measure the price of a selection of goods purchased by a "typical consumer".  In many industrial nations, annualised percentage changes in these indexes are the most commonly reported inflation figure. These measures are often used in wage and salary negotiations, since employees wish to have (nominal) pay raises that equal or exceed the rate of increase of the CPI. Sometimes, labor contracts include '''cost of living escalators''' (or adjustments) that imply nominal pay raises automatically occur with inflation, usually at a slower rate than actual inflation (and after inflation has occurred).<br/>-<br/>-* '''[[producer price index]]es''' (PPIs) which measure the price received by a producer. This differs from the CPI in that price subsidation, profits, and taxes may cause the amount received by the producer to differ from what the consumer paid. There is also typically a delay between an increase in the PPI and any resulting increase in the CPI. Producer price inflation measures the pressure being put on producers by the costs of their raw materials. This could be "passed on" as consumer inflation, or it could be absorbed by profits, or offset by increasing [[productivity]]. <br/>-<br/>-* '''[[wholesale price index]]es''' which measure the change in price of a selection of goods at wholesale (i.e., typically prior to sales taxes). These are very similar to the PPI. <br/>-<br/>-* '''[[commodity price index]]es''' which measure the change in price of a selection of commodities. In the present commodity price indexes are weighted by the relative importance of the components to production. However, single commodity indexes, or limited baskets are used as a monetary base, for example in the case of the [[gold standard]] the sole commodity used was gold. <br/>-<br/>-* '''[[GDP deflator]]''' which is based on calculations of the [[gross domestic product]]: it is based on the ratio of the total amount of money spent on GDP (nominal GDP) to the inflation-corrected measure of GDP (constant-price or "real" GDP). (See [[real vs. nominal in economics]].) It is the broadest measure of the price level. Deflators are also calculated for components of GDP such as personal consumption expenditure.<br/>-<br/>-*'''[[Employment Cost Index]]''' related to PPI and WPI is an index of the costs of employing labor. The ECI measures wages, benefits, and the other costs of maintaining a worker. In Britain this is sometimes called the "all in" cost of an employee.<br/>-<br/>-== The role of inflation in the economy ==<br/>-<br/>-A great deal of economic literature concerns the question of what causes inflation and what effects it has.  A small amount of inflation is often viewed as having a positive effect on the economy.  One reason for this is that it is difficult to renegotiate some prices, and particularly wages, downwards, so that with generally increasing prices it is easier for relative prices to adjust. Many prices are "sticky downward" and tend to creep upward, so that efforts to attain a zero inflation rate (a constant price level) punish other sectors with falling prices, profits, and employment. Efforts to attain complete price stability can also lead to [[deflation (economics)|deflation]] (steadily falling prices), which can be very destructive.<br/>-<br/>-Inflation is also viewed as a hidden risk pressure which provides an incentive for those with savings to invest them, rather than have the purchasing power of those savings erode through inflation. In investing inflation risks often cause investors to take on more [[systematic risk]], in order to gain returns which will stay ahead of expected inflation. Inflation is also used as an index for cost of living adjustments and as a peg for some bonds. In effect, inflation is the rate at which previous economic transactions are [[discounted]] economically.<br/>-<br/>-Inflation also gives central banks room to maneuver, since their primary tool for controlling the money supply and [[velocity of money]] is by setting the lowest interest rate in an economy - the discount rate at which banks can borrow from the central bank. Since borrowing at negative interest is generally ineffective, a positive inflation rate gives central bankers "ammunition", as it is sometimes called, to stimulate the economy.<br/>-<br/>-However, in general, inflation rates above the nominal amounts required to give monetary freedom, and investing incentive, are regarded as negative, particularly because in current economic theory, inflation begets further inflationary expectations. <br/>-<br/>-*Increasing ''uncertainty'' may discourage investment and saving.<br/>-*''Redistribution''<br/>-** It will redistribute income from those on fixed incomes, such as pensioners, and shifts it to those who draw a variable income, for example from wages and profits which may keep pace with inflation.<br/>-** Similarly it will redistribute wealth from those who lend a fixed amount of money to those who borrow.  For example, where the government is a net debtor, as is usually the case, it will reduce this [[debt]] redistributing money towards the government.  Thus inflation is sometimes viewed as similar to a hidden [[tax]].<br/>-* ''International trade'': If the rate of inflation is higher than that abroad, a fixed [[exchange rate]] will be undermined through a weakening [[balance of trade]].<br/>-*''Shoe leather costs'': Because the value of cash is eroded by inflation, people will tend to hold less cash during times of inflation.  This imposes real costs, for example in more frequent trips to the bank. (The term is a humorous reference to the cost of replacing shoe leather worn out when walking to the bank.)<br/>-*''Menu costs'': Firms must change their prices more frequently, which imposes costs, for example with restaurants having to reprint menus.<br/>-*''Relative Price Distortions'': Firms do not generally synchronize adjustment in prices. If there is higher inflation, firms that do not adjust their prices will have much lower prices relative to firms that do adjust them. This will distort economic decisions, since relative prices will not be reflecting relative scarcity of different goods. <br/>-*''hyperinflation'': if inflation gets totally out of control (in the upward direction), it can grossly interfere with the normal workings of the economy, hurting its ability to supply. <br/>-*''inflation tax'' when a government can improve its net financial position by allowing inflation, then this represents a tax on certain holders of currency. Governments may decide to use this "stealth tax" in order to avoid hard fiscal decisions to cut expenditures, raise taxes, or confront government unions with greater efficiency. <br/>-*''Bracket Creep'' is related to the inflation tax. By allowing inflation to move upwards, certain sticky aspects of the tax code are met by more and more people. Commonly income tax brackets, where the next dollar of income is taxed at a higher rate than previous dollars. Governments which allow inflation to "bump" people over these thresholds are, in effect, allowing a tax increase because the same real purchasing power is being taxed at a higher rate.<br/>-<br/>-As noted, some economists see moderate inflation as a benefit; some business executives see mild inflation as "greasing the wheels of commerce." A very few economists have advocated reducing inflation to zero as a monetary policy goal - particularly in the late 1990's at the end of a long disinflationary period, when the policy seemed within reach.<br/>-<br/>-== Causes of inflation ==<br/>-<br/>-There are different schools of thought as to what causes inflation. Most can be divided into two broad areas: quality theories of inflation, and quantity theories of inflation. Many theories of inflation combine the two. The quality theory of inflation rests on the expectation of a buyer accepting currency to be able to exchange that currency at a later time for goods that are desirable as a buyer, the quantity theory of inflation rests on the equation of the money supply, its velocity, and exchanges. Adam Smith and David Hume proposed a quantity theory of inflation for money, and a quality theory of inflation for production. <br/>-<br/>-=== Keynesian Theory ===<br/>-<br/>-Keynesian economic theory proposes that money is transparent to real forces in the economy, and that visible inflation is the result of pressures in the economy expressing themselves in prices.<br/>-<br/>-There are three major types of inflation, as part of what [http://faculty-web.at.nwu.edu/economics/gordon/indexlayers.html Robert J. Gordon] calls the "'''triangle model'''":<br/>-*'''[[Demand pull inflation]]''' -- inflation due to high demand for goods and low unemployment.<br/>-*'''[[Cost push inflation]]''' -- nowadays termed "supply shock inflation," due to an event such as a sudden decrease in the supply of oil. <br/>-*'''[[Built-in inflation]]''' -- induced by [[adaptive expectations]], often linked to the "price/wage spiral" because it involves workers trying to keep their wages up with prices and then employers passing higher costs on to consumers as higher prices as part of a "vicious circle." Built-in inflation reflects events in the past, and so might be seen as '''hangover inflation.'''<br/>-<br/>-A major demand-pull theory centers on the supply of money: inflation may be caused by an increase in the quantity of [[money]] in circulation relative to the ability of the economy to supply (its [[potential output]]).  This has been seen most graphically when governments have financed spending in a crisis by printing money excessively (say, due to war or civil war conditions), often leading to [[hyperinflation]] where prices rise at extremely high rates (say, doubling every month).  Another cause can be a rapid decline in the ''demand'' for money as happened in Europe during the black plague. <br/>-<br/>-The [[money supply]] is also thought to play a major role in determining levels of more moderate levels of inflation, although there are differences of opinion on how important it is.  For example, [[Monetarism|Monetarist]] economists believe that the link is very strong; [[Keynesian economics]] by contrast typically emphasize the role of [[aggregate demand]] in the economy rather than the money supply in determining inflation. That is, for Keynesians, the money supply is only one determinant of aggregate demand.<br/>-<br/>-A fundamental concept in such Keynesian analysis is the relationship between [[inflation]] and [[unemployment]], called the [[Phillips curve]].  This model suggested that price stability was a [[trade off]] against employment.  Therefore some level of inflation could be considered desirable in order to minimize unemployment.  The Philips curve model described the US experience well in the 1960s, but failed to describe the combination of rising inflation and economic stagnation (sometimes referred to as ''[[stagflation]]'') experienced in the 1970s. <br/>-<br/>-Thus, modern macroeconomics describes inflation using a Phillips curve that ''shifts'' (so the trade-off between inflation and unemployment changes) due to such matters as supply shocks and inflation becoming built into the normal workings of the economy. The former refers to such events as the oil shocks of the 1970s, while the latter refers to the [[price/wage spiral]] and [[inflationary expectations]] implying that the economy "normally" suffers from inflation. Thus, the Phillips curve represents only the [[demand pull inflation |demand-pull]] component of the triangle model.<br/>-<br/>-Another Keynesian concept is the [[potential output]] (sometimes called the "[[natural gross domestic product]]"), a level of GDP where the economy is at its optimal level of production, given institutional and natural constraints. (This level of output corresponds to the [[NAIRU]] or the "natural" rate of unemployment or the full-employment unemployment rate.)  If GDP exceeds its potential (and unemployment is below the NAIRU), the theory says that inflation will ''accelerate'' as suppliers increase their prices and built-in inflation worsens.  If GDP falls below its potential level (and unemployment is above the NAIRU), inflation will ''decelerate'' as suppliers attempt to fill excess capacity, cutting prices and undermining built-in inflation.<br/>-<br/>-However, one problem with this theory for policy-making purposes is that the exact level of potential output (and of the NAIRU) is generally unknown and tends to change over time. Inflation also seems to act in an asymmetric way, rising more quickly than it falls.  Worse, it can change due to policy: for example, high unemployment under Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the UK may have led to a rise in the NAIRU (and a fall in potential) because many of the unemployed found themselves as structurally [[unemployment |unemployed]], unable to find jobs that fit their skills in the British economy. A rise in structural unemployment implies that a smaller percentage of the labor force can find jobs at the NAIRU, where the economy avoids crossing the threshold into the realm of accelerating inflation.<br/>-<br/>-=== Monetarism ===<br/>-<br/>-One of the most influential schools of economic thinking rests on a quantity theory of money, namely monetarism. Monetarists assert that empirical study of monetary history shows that "inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon".  Modern mainstream central bank practice until recently adhered closely to this concept. <br/>-<br/>-Other schools of quantity theory include the [[austrian school |Austrian economists]]) who claim that the ''only'' cause of inflation is the increase of the money supply relative to the output of the economy.[[Inflation#References|1]] These economists outright reject the theories behind [[cost push inflation]], wage push inflation and other common theories of inflation. <br/>-<br/>-These economists derive this belief from what is known as the [[Quantity Theory of Money||Quantity Theory of Money]]. The Quantity Theory of Money, simply stated is that the total amount of spending in an economy is primarily determined by the total amount of money in existence. From this theory the following formula is created:<br/>-<br/>-<math>P=\frac{D_C}{S_C}</math><br/>-<br/>-<math>P</math> is the general price level of consumers' goods, <math>D_C</math> is the aggregate demand for consumers' goods and <math>S_C</math> is the aggregate supply of consumers' goods. The idea behind this formula is that the general price level of consumers' goods will rise only if the aggregate supply of consumers' goods goes down relative to the aggregate demand for consumers' goods, or if the aggregate demand increases relative to the aggregate supply of consumers' goods. Based on the idea that total spending is based primarily on the total amount of money in existence, the economists calculate aggregate demand for consumers' goods based on the total quantity of money. Therefore, they posit that as the quantity of money increases, total spending increases and the aggregate demand for consumers' goods increases as well. For this reason the economists who believe in the Quantity Theory of Money also believe that the only cause for rising prices in a growing economy (this means aggregate supply of consumers' goods is increasing), is an increase of the total quantity of money in existence, which is caused by monetary policies, generally of [[central bank]]s where there is a monopoly on currency issue and the lack of a commodity peg to currency. The [[central bank]] of the United States is the [[Federal Reserve]], the central bank backing the [[euro]] is the [[European Central Bank]].<br/>-<br/>-=== Rational Expectations ===<br/>-<br/>-Rational expectations, or "rashex" is a view of macro-economics which states that economic actors look into the future and try and maximize their general sense of future states of well being, and do not simply respond to the immediate opportunity cost and pressures of the present. In this view, while generally grounded in monetarism, future expectations and strategies are important for inflation as well. <br/>-<br/>-One core assertion of rashex is that actors will seek to "head off" central bank decisions, by preëmptively engaging in inflationary behavior. This means that central banks must establish their credibility in fighting inflation, or have economic actors make bets that the economy will expand, believing that the central bank will expand the money supply rather than allow a recession which would be very damaging to the economy, and possibly require government bailouts. In this view central banks might be at an advantage renouncing some flexibility of monetary policy, in order to persuade economic actors that the central bank will not allow inflation.<br/>-<br/>-=== Other theories ===<br/>-<br/>-[[Supply-side economics]] asserts that inflation is always caused by either an increase in the supply of money or a decrease in the demand for money. The value of money is seen as being purely subject to these two factors. Thus the inflation experienced during the [[Black Plague]] in medieval Europe is seen as being caused by a decrease in the demand for money (the money stock used was gold coin and it was relatively fixed), whilst the inflation of the 1970s is regarded as being initially caused by an increased supply of money that occurred following the US exit from the Bretton Woods [[gold standard]]. [[Supply-side economics]] asserts that the money supply can grow without causing inflation as long as the demand for money also grows.<br/>-<br/>-In Karl Marx' theory of money, gold was the ultimate intrinsic store of value, and therefore the measure of all other forms of value. In Marxist economic theory, value is based on the labor required to extract a given commodity versus the demand for that commodity by those with money. The fluctuations of price in money terms are inconsequential compared to the rise and fall of the labor cost of a commodity, since this determines the true cost of a good or service. In this Marxist economics is related to other "classical" economic theories which argue that monetary inflation is caused solely by printing notes in excess of the basic quantity of gold. However, Marx argues that the real kind of inflation is in the cost of production measured in labor. Because of the classical labor theory of value, the only factor which is important is whether more or less labor is required to produce a given commodity at the rate it is demanded.<br/>-<br/>-Within the context of a fixed specie basis for money, one important controversy was between the "Quantity Theory" of money and the [[Real bills doctrine | Real Bills Doctrine]]. Within this context, quantity theory applies to the level of fractional reserve accounting allowed against specie, generally gold, held by a bank. The RBD argues that banks should also be able to issue currency against bills of trading, that is "real bills" that they buy from merchants. This theory was important in the 19th century in debates between "Banking" and "Currency" schools of monetary soundness, and in the formation of the [[Federal Reserve]]. In the wake of the collapse of the international gold standard post 1913, and the move towards deficit financing of government, RBD has remained a minor topic, primarily of interest in limited contexts, such as [[currency board | currency boards]]. It is generally held in ill repute today, with Mishkin going so far as to say it had been "completely discreditted." Even so, it has theoretical support from a few economists, particularly those that see restrictions on a particular class of credit as incompatible with [[libertarian]] principles of laissez-faire, even though almost all libertarian economists are opposed to the RBD.<br/>-<br/>-== Stopping inflation ==<br/>-<br/>-There are a number of methods which have been suggested to stop inflation. [[Central Bank]]s such as the U.S. [[Federal Reserve]] can affect inflation to a significant extent through setting interest rates and through other operations (i.e., using [[monetary policy]]).  High interest rates (and slow growth of the money supply) are the traditional way that Central Banks fight inflation, using unemployment and the decline of production to prevent price increases.<br/>-<br/>-However, central banks are at the root of inflation.  Monitary policies where the money supply is increased are at the root of all inflationary events.<br/>-<br/>-Monetarists emphasize increasing interest rates (reducing the money supply, [[monetary policy]]) to fight inflation.  Keynesians emphasize reducing demand in general, often through [[fiscal policy]], using increased taxation or reduced government spending to reduce demand as well as by using monetary policy.  [[supply-side economics|Supply-side economists]] advocate fighting inflation by fixing the exchange rate between the currency and some reference currency such as gold. This would be a return to the [[gold standard]]. All of these policies are achieved in practice through a process of [[open market operations]].<br/>-<br/>-Another method attempted is simply instituting wage and price controls ("[[incomes policies]]'). Wage and price controls have been successful in wartime environments in combination with rationing. However, their use in other contexts is far more mixed. Notable failures of their use include the 1972 imposition of wage and price controls by Richard Nixon. In general wage and price controls are regarded as a drastic measure, and only effective when coupled with policies designed to reduce the underlying causes of inflation during the wage and price control regime, for example, winning the war being fought. Many developed nations set prices extensively, including for basic commodities as gasoline. The usual economic analysis is that that which is under priced is overconsumed, and that the distortions that occur will force adjustments in supply. For example, if the official price of bread is too low, there will be too little bread at official prices. <br/>-<br/>-Temporary controls may ''complement'' a recession as a way to fight inflation: the controls make the recession more efficient as a way to fight inflation (reducing the need to increase [[unemployment]]), while the recession prevents the kinds of distortions that controls cause when demand is high. However, in general the advice of economists is not to impose price controls, but to liberalize prices, assuming that the economy will adjust, abandoing unprofitable economic activity. The lower activity will place fewer demands on whatever commodities were driving inflation, whether labor or resources, and inflation will fall with total economic output. This often produces a severe recession, as productive capacity is reallocated, and is thus often very unpopular with the people whose livelihoods are destroyed.
