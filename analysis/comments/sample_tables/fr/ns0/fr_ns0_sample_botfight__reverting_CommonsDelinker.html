This only happens if the shock wave travels in a direction toward Earth.  The solar wind pressure on the magnetosphere will increase or decrease depending on the Sun's activity.

This field will have either a North or South orientation.  If the solar wind has energetic bursts, contracting and expanding the magnetosphere, or if the solar wind takes a southward [[polarization]], geomagnetic storms can be expected. The southward field causes magnetic reconnection of the dayside magnetopause, rapidly injecting magnetic and particle energy into the Earth's magnetosphere.  <br/>+<br/>+During a geomagnetic storm the [[ionosphere]]'s F<sub>2</sub> layer will become unstable, fragment, and may even disappear.

Earth's atmosphere and [[magnetosphere]] allow adequate protection for us on the ground, but [[astronaut]]s in space are subject to potentially lethal dosages of [[ionizing radiation|radiation]]. The penetration of high-energy particles into living cells, measured as [[radiation dose]], leads to [[chromosome]] damage and, potentially, [[cancer]]. Large doses can be fatal immediately. Solar [[proton]]s with energies greater than 30 MeV are particularly hazardous. In [[October]] [[1989]], the Sun produced enough energetic particles that an astronaut on the [[Moon]], wearing only a [[space suit]] and caught out in the brunt of the storm, would probably have died; the expected dose would be about 7000 [[Rontgen equivalent man|rem]]. (Astronauts who had time to gain safety in a shelter beneath moon soil would have absorbed only slight amounts of radiation.) The astronauts on the [[Mir]] station were subjected to daily doses of about twice the yearly dose on the ground, and during the solar storm at the end of 1989 they absorbed their full-year radiation dose limit in just a few hours.<br/>+<br/>+[[Solar proton event]]s can also produce elevated radiation aboard [[Jet airliner|aircraft]] flying at high altitudes. Although these risks are small, monitoring of solar proton events by satellite instrumentation allows the occasional exposure to be monitored and evaluated, and eventually the flight paths and altitudes adjusted in order to lower the absorbed dose of the [[flight crew]]s.<br/>+<br/>+===Climate===<br/>+The Sun is the heat engine that drives the circulation of our atmosphere. Although it has long been assumed to be a constant source of energy, recent measurements of this [[solar constant]] have shown that the base output of the Sun can vary by up to two tenths of a percent over the 11-year [[solar cycle]]. Temporary decreases of up to one-half percent have been observed. Atmospheric scientists say that this variation is significant and that it can modify climate over time. Plant growth has been shown to vary over the 11-year [[sunspot]] and 22-year magnetic cycles of the Sun, as evidenced in tree-ring records.<br/>+<br/>+While the solar cycle has been nearly regular during the last 300 years, there was a period of 70 years during the 17th and 18th centuries when very few sunspots were seen (even though telescopes were widely used). This drop in sunspot number coincided with the timing of the [[Little Ice Age]] in [[Europe]], implying a Sun-to-climate connection. Recently, a more direct link between climate and solar variability has been speculated. Stratospheric winds near the equator blow in different directions, depending on the time in the solar cycle. Studies are under way to determine how this wind reversal affects global circulation patterns and weather.<br/>+<br/>+During proton events, many more energetic particles reach Earth's middle atmosphere. There they cause molecular ionization, creating chemicals that destroy atmospheric [[ozone]] and allow increased amounts of harmful solar ultraviolet radiation to reach Earth's surface. A solar proton event in [[1982]] resulted in a temporary 70% decrease in ozone densities.<br/>+<br/>+===Biology===<br/>+There is a growing body of evidence that changes in the geomagnetic field affect biological systems. Studies indicate that physically stressed human biological systems may respond to fluctuations in the geomagnetic field. Interest and concern in this subject have led the [[Union of Radio Science International]] to create a new commission entitled [[Electromagnetics in Biology and Medicine]].<br/>+<br/>+Possibly the most closely studied of the variable Sun's biological effects has been the degradation of [[homing pigeon]]s' navigational abilities during geomagnetic storms. Pigeons and other migratory animals, such as [[dolphin]]s and [[whale]]s, have internal biological compasses composed of the mineral [[magnetite]] wrapped in bundles of nerve cells. While this probably is not their primary method of navigation, there have been many pigeon race smashes, a term used when only a small percentage of birds return home from a release site. Because these losses have occurred during geomagnetic storms, pigeon handlers have learned to ask for geomagnetic alerts and warnings as an aid to scheduling races.<br/>+<br/>+===Disrupted systems===<br/>+<br/>+====Communications====<br/>+Many communication systems utilize the ionosphere to reflect radio signals over long distances. Ionospheric storms can affect radio communication at all latitudes. Some radio frequencies are absorbed and others are reflected, leading to rapidly fluctuating signals and unexpected propagation paths. TV and commercial radio stations are little affected by solar activity, but ground-to-air, ship-to-shore, [[Voice of America]], [[Radio Free Europe]], and [[amateur radio]] are frequently disrupted. Radio operators using high frequencies rely upon solar and geomagnetic alerts to keep their communication circuits up and running.<br/>+<br/>+Some military detection or early warning systems are also affected by solar activity. The ''[[over-the-horizon radar]]'' bounces signals off the ionosphere in order to monitor the launch of aircraft and missiles from long distances. During geomagnetic storms, this system can be severely hampered by radio clutter. Some submarine detection systems use the magnetic signatures of submarines as one input to their locating schemes. Geomagnetic storms can mask and distort these signals.<br/>+<br/>+The [[Federal Aviation Administration]] routinely receives alerts of solar radio bursts so that they can recognize communication problems and forego unnecessary maintenance. When an aircraft and a ground station are aligned with the Sun, jamming of air-control radio frequencies can occur. This can also happen when an Earth station, a satellite, and the Sun are in alignment.<br/>+<br/>+The [[electrical telegraph|telegraph]] lines in the past were affected by geomagnetic storms as well. The telegraphs used a long wire for the data line, stretching for many miles, using ground as the return wire and being fed with DC power from a battery; this made them (together with the power lines mentioned below) susceptible to being influenced by the fluctuations caused by the [[ring current]]. The voltage/current induced by the geomagnetic storm could've led to diminishing of the signal, when subtracted from the battery polarity, or to overly strong and spurious signals when added to it; some operators in such cases even learned to disconnect the battery and rely on the induced current as their power source. In extreme cases the induced current was so high the coils at the receiving side burst in flames, or the operators received electric shocks. Geomagnetic storms affect also long-haul telephone lines, including undersea cables.[http://image.gsfc.nasa.gov/poetry/storm/storms.html]<br/>+<br/>+====Navigation systems====<br/>+Systems such as [[GPS]], [[LORAN]], and [[OMEGA]] are adversely affected when solar activity disrupts their signal propagation. The OMEGA system consists of eight transmitters located through out the world. Airplanes and ships use the very low frequency signals from these transmitters to determine their positions. During solar events and geomagnetic storms, the system can give navigators information that is inaccurate by as much as several miles. If navigators are alerted that a proton event or geomagnetic storm is in progress, they can switch to a backup system. <br/>+<br/>+GPS signals are affected when solar activity causes sudden variations in the density of the ionosphere, causing the GPS signals to scintillate. The scintillation of satellite signals during ionospheric disturbances is studied at [[High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program|HAARP]] during ionospheric modification experiments. It has also been studied at the [[National Science Foundation]] equatorial ionospheric observation facility in [[Jicamarca]], [[Peru]].<br/>+<br/>+====Satellites====<br/>+Geomagnetic storms and increased solar [[ultraviolet]] emission heat Earth's upper atmosphere, causing it to expand. The heated air rises, and the density at the orbit of [[satellite]]s up to about 1000 km increases significantly. This results in increased [[drag]] on satellites in space, causing them to slow and change [[orbit]] slightly. Unless [[Low Earth Orbit]] satellites are routinely boosted to higher orbits, they slowly fall, and eventually burn up in Earth's atmosphere.<br/>+<br/>+[[Skylab]] is an example of a spacecraft [[reentry|reentering]] Earth's atmosphere prematurely as a result of higher-than-expected [[solar activity]]. During the great geomagnetic storm of [[March]] [[1989]], four of the Navy's navigational satellites had to be taken out of service for up to a week, the [[U.S. Air Force Space Command|U.S. Space Command]] had to post new [[orbital elements]] for over 1000 objects affected, and the [[Solar Maximum Mission]] satellite was sent towards meeting the Skylab fate in December the same year.<br/>+<br/>+The vulnerability of the satellites depends on their position as well. The [[South Atlantic Anomaly]] is a perilous place for a satellite to pass through.<br/>+<br/>+As technology has allowed spacecraft components to become smaller, their miniaturized systems have become increasingly vulnerable to the more energetic [[solar wind|solar particles]]. These particles can cause physical [[radiation hardening|damage to microchips]] and can change software commands in satellite-borne computers.<br/>+<br/>+=====Differential charging=====<br/>+Another problem for satellite operators is '''differential charging'''. During geomagnetic storms, the number and energy of [[electron]]s and [[ion]]s increase. When a satellite travels through this energized environment, the [[charged particle]]s striking the spacecraft cause different portions of the spacecraft to be differentially [[electric charge|charged]]. Eventually, electrical discharges can [[electric arc|arc]] across spacecraft components, harming and possibly disabling them. <br/>+<br/>+=====Bulk charging=====<br/>+'''Bulk charging''' (also called '''deep charging''') occurs when energetic particles, primarily electrons, penetrate the outer covering of a satellite and deposit their charge in its internal parts. If sufficient charge accumulates in any one component, it may attempt to neutralize by discharging to other components. This discharge is potentially hazardous to the satellite's electronic systems.<br/>+<br/>+====Geologic exploration====<br/>+Earth's magnetic field is used by geologists to determine subterranean rock structures. For the most part, these geodetic surveyors are searching for [[oil]], gas, or [[mineral]] deposits. They can accomplish this only when Earth's field is quiet, so that true magnetic signatures can be detected. Other surveyors prefer to work during geomagnetic storms, when the variations to Earth's normal subsurface electric currents help them to see subsurface oil or mineral structures. For these reasons, many surveyors use geomagnetic alerts and predictions to schedule their mapping activities.<br/>+<br/>+====Electric power====<br/>+When [[magnetic field]]s move about in the vicinity of a conductor such as a wire, an electric current is [[electromagnetic induction|induced]] into the conductor. This happens on a grand scale during geomagnetic storms (the same mechanism also influences telephone and telegraph lines, see above). Power companies transmit alternating current to their customers via long transmission lines. The nearly direct currents induced in these lines from geomagnetic storms are harmful to electrical transmission equipment, especially to the [[transformer]]s&mdash;it overheats their coils and causes [[saturation (magnetic)|saturation]] of their cores, constraining their performance; it also tends to trip various protective devices. On [[March 13]], [[1989]], in [[Quebec|Québec]], 6 million people were without commercial electric power for 9 hours as a result of a huge geomagnetic storm. Some areas in the northeastern U.S. and in Sweden also lost power. By receiving geomagnetic storm alerts and warnings, power companies can minimize damage and power outages.<br/>+<br/>+====Pipelines====<br/>+Rapidly fluctuating geomagnetic fields can [[electromagnetic induction|induce]] currents into [[pipeline]]s. During these times, several problems can arise for pipeline engineers. Flow meters in the pipeline can transmit erroneous flow information, and the [[corrosion]] rate of the pipeline is dramatically increased. If engineers unwittingly attempt to balance the current during a geomagnetic storm, corrosion rates may increase even more. Pipeline managers routinely receive alerts and warnings to help them provide an efficient and long-lived system.<br/>+<br/>+==See also==<br/>+* ''[[A New Theory of Magnetic Storms]]''<br/>+* [http://www.agu.org/sci_soc/eiskappenman.html Geomagnetic Storms Can Threaten Electric Power Grid] - [[American Geophysical Union]], ''Earth in Space'', Vol. 9, No. 7, March 1997, pp. 9-11.<br/>+*[http://spacescience.com/newhome/headlines/ast29dec99_1.htm The warp and woof of a geomagnetic storm] - [[NASA]]'s ''[[Space science|Space Science]] News''.<br/>+*[http://www.sec.noaa.gov/NOAAscales/ NOAA Space Weather Scales] - [[NOAA]].<br/>+<br/>+==Suggested reading==<br/>+<br/>+* Davies, K., 1990, Ionospheric Radio.

For these reasons, many surveyors use geomagnetic alerts and predictions to schedule their mapping activities.<br/>+<br/>+====Electric power====<br/>+When [[magnetic field]]s move about in the vicinity of a conductor such as a wire, an electric current is [[electromagnetic induction|induced]] into the conductor. This happens on a grand scale during geomagnetic storms (the same mechanism also influences telephone and telegraph lines, see above). Power companies transmit alternating current to their customers via long transmission lines. The nearly direct currents induced in these lines from geomagnetic storms are harmful to electrical transmission equipment, especially to the [[transformer]]s&mdash;it overheats their coils and causes [[saturation (magnetic)|saturation]] of their cores, constraining their performance; it also tends to trip various protective devices. On [[March 13]], [[1989]], in [[Quebec|Québec]], 6 million people were without commercial electric power for 9 hours as a result of a huge geomagnetic storm. Some areas in the northeastern U.S. and in Sweden also lost power. By receiving geomagnetic storm alerts and warnings, power companies can minimize damage and power outages.<br/>+<br/>+====Pipelines====<br/>+Rapidly fluctuating geomagnetic fields can [[electromagnetic induction|induce]] currents into [[pipeline]]s. During these times, several problems can arise for pipeline engineers. Flow meters in the pipeline can transmit erroneous flow information, and the [[corrosion]] rate of the pipeline is dramatically increased. If engineers unwittingly attempt to balance the current during a geomagnetic storm, corrosion rates may increase even more. Pipeline managers routinely receive alerts and warnings to help them provide an efficient and long-lived system.<br/>+<br/>+==See also==<br/>+* ''[[A New Theory of Magnetic Storms]]''<br/>+* [http://www.agu.org/sci_soc/eiskappenman.html Geomagnetic Storms Can Threaten Electric Power Grid] - [[American Geophysical Union]], ''Earth in Space'', Vol. 9, No. 7, March 1997, pp. 9-11.<br/>+*[http://spacescience.com/newhome/headlines/ast29dec99_1.htm The warp and woof of a geomagnetic storm] - [[NASA]]'s ''[[Space science|Space Science]] News''.<br/>+*[http://www.sec.noaa.gov/NOAAscales/ NOAA Space Weather Scales] - [[NOAA]].<br/>+<br/>+==Suggested reading==<br/>+<br/>+* Davies, K., 1990, Ionospheric Radio.
