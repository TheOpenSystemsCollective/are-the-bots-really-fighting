His maternal grandfather, Stan Wemyss, was a [[cinematographer]] who, according to Crowe, produced the first film by [[New Zealand]]er [[Geoff Murphy]],<ref>http://franklovece.com/subpage2.html#croweNewsday</ref> and was also named an [[Member of the Order of the British Empire|MBE]] for filming footage of [[World War II]]. Crowe's maternal great-great-great grandmother was a [[Māori]],<ref name="actors" /><ref>http://achika.tripod.com/bio.htm</ref> and as a result Crowe is registered on the Māori electoral roll in New Zealand; Crowe also has [[Norway|Norwegian]], Scottish and Welsh ancestry.<ref name="actors" /><ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/4070410.stm</ref><ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/iconsofwales/sites/content/pages/russell_crowe.shtml</ref><br/>-<br/>-When Crowe was four years old, his family moved to [[Australia]], where his parents pursued a career in filmset catering. The producer of the Australian TV series ''Spyforce'' was his mother's godfather, and Crowe at age five or six was hired for a line of dialogue in one episode, opposite series star [[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]], who years later played Crowe's father in ''[[The Sum of Us]]'' and who coincidentally had been educated at the same school which Crowe was to attend for two years: [[Sydney Boys High School]].<br/>-<br/>-When he was 14, however, Crowe's family moved back to [[New Zealand]], where he attended [[Auckland Grammar School]] with his cousins [[Martin Crowe]] and [[Jeff Crowe]]. He did not complete secondary school, leaving early to help his family financially. In the mid-1980s Russell, under guidance from his good friend [[Tom Sharplin]], performed as a rock 'n' roll revivalist, under the stage name ''Russ Le Roq,'' and had a New Zealand single with "I Wanna Be [[Marlon Brando]]." <br/>-<br/>-Crowe returned to Australia at age 21, intending to apply to the [[National Institute of Dramatic Art]]. "I was working in a theater show, and talked to a guy who was then the head of technical support at NIDA," Crowe recalled. "I asked him what he thought about me spending three years at NIDA. He told me it'd be a waste of time. He said, 'You already do the things you go there to learn, and you've been doing it for most of your life, so there's nothing to teach you but bad habits.'"<ref>http://franklovece.com/subpage2.html#croweNewsday</ref> In 1987 Crowe spent a six-month stint as a busker when he couldn't find other work.<ref>http://russellcrowe.5u.com/Interviews/JuiceMagazine_5_93.html</ref><br/>-<br/>-After appearing in the TV series ''[[Neighbours]]'' and ''Living with the Law,'' Crowe was cast in his first film, ''The Crossing'' (1990), a small-town love triangle directed by George Ogilvie. Before production started, a film-student protege of Ogilvie's, Steve Wallace, hired Crowe for the film ''[[Blood Oath (movie)|Blood Oath]]'' (1990) (a.k.a. ''Prisoners of the Sun'') which was released a month earlier, although actually filmed later.<br/>-<br/>-In 1992, Crowe starred in the first episode of the second Series of ''[[Police Rescue]].''<br/>-<br/>-===Hollywood===<br/>-After initial success in Australia, Crowe began acting in American films. He went on to become a three-time Oscar nominee, winning the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] as [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] in [[2001 in film|2001]] for ''[[Gladiator (2000 movie)|Gladiator]]''. Crowe wore his grandfather Stan Wemyss's [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] medal to the ceremony.<br/>-<br/>-Crowe received three consecutive best actor Oscar nominations for ''[[The Insider (film)|The Insider]]'', ''[[Gladiator (2000 movie)|Gladiator]]'' and ''[[A Beautiful Mind (film)|A Beautiful Mind]]''. All three films were also nominated for best picture, and both ''Gladiator'' and ''A Beautiful Mind'' won the award. Within the six year stretch from 1997-2003, he also starred in two other best picture nominees, ''[[LA Confidential]]'' and ''[[Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World]]'', though he was nominated for neither. In 2005 he re-teamed with ''A Beautiful Mind'' director Ron Howard for ''[[Cinderella Man]]''. In 2006 he re-teamed with ''[[Gladiator (2000 movie)|Gladiator]]'' director [[Ridley Scott]] for ''[[A Good Year]]'', the first of two consecutive collaborations (the second being ''American Gangster'', due for release in late 2007). While the light romantic comedy of ''A Good Year'' was not greatly received, Crowe seemed pleased with the film, telling [http://www.stv.tv stv] in an [http://www.stv.tv/out/showArticle.jsp?source=opencms&articleId=/out/dontmiss/Russell_Crowe_video_interview interview] that he thought it would be enjoyed by fans of his other films. <br/>-<br/>-On [[March 9]], [[2005]], Crowe revealed to ''[[Gentlemen's Quarterly|GQ]]'' magazine that [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] agents had approached him prior to the [[73rd Academy Awards]] on March 25, 2001 and told him that the [[Islamist terrorism|Islamist terrorist group]] [[al-Qaeda]] wanted to [[Kidnapping|kidnap]] him. Crowe told the magazine that it was the first time he had ever heard of al-Qaeda (the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 attacks]] took place later that year) and was quoted as saying: <br/>-<br/>-:"You get this late-night call from the FBI when you arrive in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], and they're, like, absolutely full-on. 'We’ve got to talk to you now before you do anything. We have to have a discussion with you, Mr. Crowe.'" Crowe recalled that "it was something to do with some recording picked up by a French policewoman, I think, in either [[Libya]] or [[Algiers]]...it was about taking iconographic Americans out of the picture as a sort of cultural-destabilization plan." <ref name="alqaida">http://www.guardian.co.uk/alqaida/story/0,12469,1433507,00.html</ref><br/>-<br/>-Crowe was guarded by [[Secret Service]] agents for the next few months, both while shooting films and at award ceremonies ([[Scotland Yard]] also guarded Crowe while he was promoting ''[[Proof of Life]]'' in [[London]] in February 2001). Crowe said that he "...never fully understood what the fuck was going on".<ref name="alqaida" /> The FBI confirmed Crowe's statement (which is uncharacteristic of the agency in that it usually does not comment to the media).<br/>-<br/>-===Temperament===<br/>-Crowe has been involved in a number of altercations in recent years which have given him a reputation for having a bad temper. When part of Crowe's appearance at the 2002 [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] (BAFTA) awards was cut out to fit into the [[BBC]]'s tape-delayed broadcast, Crowe accosted producer Malcolm Gerrie.  (The part cut was a poem in tribute to actor [[Richard Harris]] who was then terminally ill.)  During the filming of ''A Beautiful Mind'' on the campus of [[Princeton University]], Crowe made an [[The finger|obscene gesture]] to Princeton student Meredith Moroney whom he spotted photographing him, which raised a media stir.<ref>http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/archives/2001/03/29/news/2730.shtml</ref> (The student was filming from a dormitory window.  The students had been told not to interrupt the filming by college authorities.)  In 1999, Crowe was involved in a scuffle at the Saloon Bar in [[Coffs Harbour, New South Wales|Coffs Harbour]], [[Australia]], which was caught by a security video.<br/>-<br/>-In June 2005, Crowe was arrested and charged with second degree [[assault]] by [[New York City Police Department|New York City police]], in connection with an incident at the Mercer Hotel, [[SoHo]], [[New York]]. Crowe threw a [[telephone]] at a hotel employee who refused to help him place a call when the system did not work from his room, and was charged with fourth-degree criminal possession of a weapon (the telephone). Crowe, who was sentenced to conditional release, paid about US$100,000 to settle the civil lawsuit to the concierge, who was treated for a facial laceration. Crowe's temperament was parodied in an episode of the cartoon ''[[South Park]]'' titled "[[The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer]]". In this episode, Crowe is the star of his own, fictional TV series: ''[[The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer#Russell Crowe: Fightin.27 Around The World|Russell Crowe: Fightin' Around The World]]'', in which he travels the globe in his tug boat to instigate altercations with strangers of different nationalities. Crowe's temperament was also parodied on the Australian [[Seven Network]] skit show ''[[Big Bite]]'' in 2003. The [[Network Ten]] show ''[[The Secret Life of Us]]'' was parodied on the show as ''The Secret Life of Russ''. The "phone incident" was parodied in ''[[Scary Movie 4]]'' when Brenda is dreaming, one of her lines is "Look out, Russell Crowe's got a phone!"<br/>-<br/>-On other occasions, however, he has been known to show compassion. Following the death of his friend, [[Natural history|naturalist]] and [[television personality]] [[Steve Irwin]], Russell remarked that Irwin was "the Australian we all aspire to be." He also recently slammed a report claiming he was hoping to portray Irwin in a biopic about his life, stating, "It's appalling to me and offends me very deeply. It's so awful that I have to deal with millions of people thinking I would dance on my friend's grave. Yes, I do think there should be a movie made about Steve but I'm not the sort of person who will be doing commerce on my friend's grave." <ref>http://www.imdb.com/news/wenn/2006-09-26/</ref><br/>-<br/>-===Family and general interests===<br/>-On [[April 7]], [[2003]], his 39th birthday, Crowe married Australian singer and actress [[Danielle Spencer (Australian actress)|Danielle Spencer]]. Crowe met Spencer while filming ''[[The Crossing]]'' (1990). Crowe also dated American actress [[Meg Ryan]] after they had an admitted affair while filming ''[[Proof of Life]]'' (2000) and in the past, he has been linked to [[Erica Baxter]], [[Peta Wilson]] and [[Courtney Love]]. Crowe and Spencer have two sons: Charles "Charlie" Spencer Crowe (born [[December 21]], [[2003]]) and  Tennyson Spencer Crowe (born [[July 7]], [[2006]]).  <br/>-<br/>-He supports the [[Richmond Football Club]] in the [[Australian Football League]] [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000128/bio].<br/>-<br/>-Two of Russell Crowe's cousins, [[Martin Crowe|Martin]] and [[Jeff Crowe]] are former [[New Zealand national cricket captains]].  <br/>-<br/>-Most of the year, Crowe resides in Australia at both his [[Sydney]] home in [[Woolloomooloo, New South Wales|Woolloomooloo]] and his 320 hectare rural property in [[Nana Glen, New South Wales|Nana Glen]] near [[Coffs Harbour, New South Wales]], but he rented a house for Summer 2006 in [[Nyack, New York]] while he worked on a movie being shot in [[New York City]].<br/>-<br/>-===South Sydney Rabbitohs===<br/>-On 19 March, 2006, the voting members of the [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]] [[National Rugby League]] club voted (in a 75.8% majority) to allow Crowe and businessman [[Peter Holmes à Court]] to purchase 75% of the club, leaving 25% ownership with the members. It will cost them ([[Australian dollar|AUD]]) $3 million, and they will receive four of eight seats on the [[board of directors]].<br/>-<br/>-Crowe has been a major supporter of the Rabbitohs [[rugby league]] team for many years, appearing at many home games, and supporting the club during its time when they were forced from the [[National Rugby League]] competition for two years. Crowe paid $40,000 for a brass bell used to open the [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1908|first rugby league competition]] match in Australia in 1908, which he then returned to the club. In 2005, he made them the first club team in Australia to be sponsored by a film, when he negotiated a deal to advertise his movie ''[[Cinderella Man]]'' on their jerseys. <br/>-<br/>-He is friends with many current and former players of the club, and currently employs former South Sydney forward [[Mark Carroll (rugby league footballer)|Mark Carroll]] as a [[bodyguard]] and [[personal trainer]]. He has encouraged other actors to support the club, such as [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Burt Reynolds]]. Business and television personality [[Eddie McGuire]] has been offered a seat on the Rabbitohs board.<br/>-<br/>-===Musical Activities===<br/>-[[Image:Russell_crowe_&_alan_doyle.jpg|right|thumb|Russell Crowe & Alan Doyle]]<br/>-<br/>-Crowe's early stage name as a musician was "Rus Le Roq" and he was billed as such while performing with the [[New Zealand]] production of ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]''. Crowe also toured with ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'' in the Australian company.  Crowe performed lead vocals and guitar for an Australian pub rock band, '''[[30 Odd Foot Of Grunts]]''' formed in 1992.  The band had found neither critical nor popular success but had several releases including 1998's ''Gaslight'', 2001's ''Bastard Life or Clarity'' and 2003's ''Other Ways of Speaking'', plus various CD releases now out of print.  The band's web site indicates that group has "dissolved/evolved" and states that Crowe's music would take a new direction.  <br/>-<br/>-He continued with a collaboration with [[Alan Doyle]] of the Canadian band [[Great Big Sea]] in early 2005, which also involved members of his previous band. A new single, ''Raewyn'', was released in April 2005 and an album entitled ''My Hand, My Heart'' has been released for download on [[iTunes]]. The album includes a tribute song to the late actor, [[Richard Harris (actor)|Richard Harris]], who became Crowe's friend during the making of ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]''. In 2002, he directed the music video clip (which starred former child actor Duy Nguyen) for his wife [[Danielle Spencer]]'s single 'Tickle Me' from her 'White Monkey' album. On March 10, 2006, Russell Crowe performed with his new band '''The Ordinary Fear of God''' on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' with Jay Leno.<br/>-<br/>-==Selected filmography==<br/>-*''[[Neighbours]]'' (TV Show) (1987)<br/>-*''[[The Crossing]]'' (1990)<br/>-*''Prisoners of the Sun'' (1990)<br/>-*''[[Hammers Over the Anvil]]'' (1991)<br/>-*''[[Proof (1991 film)|Proof]]'' (1991)<br/>-*''[[The Efficiency Expert]]'' (1992)<br/>-*''[[Romper Stomper]]'' (1992)<br/>-*''[[Police Rescue]]'' (1992) (Episode: ''The Right Stuff'')<br/>-*''[[For the Moment]]'' (1993)<br/>-*''[[Love in Limbo]]'' (1993)<br/>-*''[[The Silver Stallion: King of the Wild Brumbies]]'' (1993)<br/>-*''[[The Sum of Us]]'' (1994)<br/>-*''[[The Quick and the Dead (1995 film)|The Quick and the Dead]]'' ([[1995 in film|1995]])<br/>-*''No Way Back'' (1995)<br/>-*''[[Virtuosity]]'' (1995)<br/>-*''[[Rough Magic]]'' (1995)<br/>-*''[[L.A.

The prominent music critic [[John Rockwell]] has been quoted in the [[New York Times]] as saying that "Ives's voice... had the sheen and finesse of opera without its latter-day [[Puccini|Puccinian]] vulgarities and without the pretensions of operatic ritual.  It was genteel in expressive impact without being genteel in social conformity.  And it moved people." <ref>John Rockwell, quoted in book review of ''Outsider, John Rockwell on the Arts, 1967-2006'', by John Rockwell, the [[New York Times]] Book Review, 24 December 2006, page 13</ref><br/>+<br/>+From [[1927]] to [[1929]] Ives attended Eastern Illinois State Teachers College in Charleston (now [[Eastern Illinois University]]), where he played football. During college he was a member of the [[Phi Sigma Kappa]] fraternity. One day during his junior year, he was sitting in English class, listening to a lecture on ''Beowulf'', when he suddenly realized that he was wasting his time. So he got up to leave, but as he walked out the door, the professor made a snide remark, so Ives slammed the door behind him, breaking the glass.<ref>Burl Ives, ''Wayfaring Stranger'', New York: Whittlesey House, 1948, pp. 108-109</ref> Sixty years later, the school named a building after its most famous dropout.<ref>"Eastern Illinois University Honors Famed Dropout Burl Ives," ''St. Louis Post Dispatch'', May 3, 1990, p., 71. By the Associated Press. From NewsBank.</ref><br/>+<br/>+Ives traveled about the U.S. as an itinerant singer during the early [[1930s]], earning his way by doing odd jobs and playing his [[banjo]]. He was jailed in [[Mona, Utah]], for vagrancy and for singing “[[Foggy Foggy Dew]],” which the authorities decided was a bawdy song. <ref>Burl Ives, ''Wayfaring Stranger'', New York: Whittlesey House, 1948, pp. 129-132.</ref> In ''c.'' 1931 he landed on [[WBOW]] radio in [[Terre Haute, Indiana]].

The show was very popular. In the [[1940s]] he popularized several traditional folk songs, such as “[[Lavender Blue]]” (his first hit, a folk song from the [[17th century]]), “[[Foggy Foggy Dew]]” (an English/Irish folk song), “[[Blue Tail Fly]]” (an old [[American Civil War|Civil War]] tune) and “[[Big Rock Candy Mountain]]” (an old [[hobo]] ditty).<br/>+<br/>+Ives was drafted by the military in [[1942]] but was discharged a year later for medical problems.<ref>Richard Severo, "Burl Ives, the Folk Singer Whose Imposing Acting Won an Oscar, Dies at 85," ''New York Times'', April 15, 1995, p. 10</ref> On Dec. 6, [[1945]], he married 29-year-old script writer Helen Peck Ehrlich.<ref>"Burl Ives Weds Script Writer," ''New York Times'', Dec. 8, 1945, p. 24</ref> The couple divorced in [[1971]]. <ref>"Burl Ives Divorced," ''New York Times'', Feb. 19, 1971, p. 27.</ref> He married Dorothy Koster Paul in 1971.<br/>+<br/>+In [[1946]] Ives was cast as a singing cowboy in the [[film]] ''Smoky''. Other movie credits include ''[[East of Eden (1955 film)|East of Eden]]'' ([[1955]]); ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]'' ([[1958]]); ''[[The Big Country]]'' ([[1958]]), for which he won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for Best Supporting Actor; and ''[[Our Man in Havana]]'' ([[1959]]), based on the [[Graham Greene]] novel; and many others. <br/>+<br/>+His autobiography, ''The Wayfaring Stranger'', was published in [[1948]]. He also wrote or compiled several other books, including ''Burl Ives Song Book'' ([[1953]]); ''Tales of America'' ([[1954]]); ''Sea Songs of Sailing, Whaling, and Fishing'' ([[1956]]); and ''The Wayfaring Stranger's Notebook'' (1962). <br/>+<br/>+Ives had an impressive [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] career, including appearances in ''[[The Boys From Syracuse]]'' (1938-39), ''Heavenly Express'' ([[1940]]), ''[[This Is the Army]]'' ([[1942]]), ''Sing Out Sweet Land'' ([[1944]]), ''[[Paint Your Wagon]]'' (1951-52), and ''Dr. Cook's Garden'' ([[1967]]); his most notable Broadway performance was as Big Daddy in ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]'' (1955-56), a role written specifically for Ives by [[Tennessee Williams]].  <br/>+<br/>+Ives was identified in the infamous [[1950]] pamphlet ''[[Red Channels]]'' as an entertainer with supposed Communist ties.<ref>Michael D.

In [[1962]] he released three major hits, “A Little Bitty Tear,” “Call Me Mr In-Between,” and “Funny Way of Laughing,” all three of which crossed over and topped the pop charts as well. <br/>+<br/>+Ives played the narrator, [[Sam the Snowman]], in the [[Rankin-Bass]] [[animated]] [[television special]], ''[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (television special)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]'' ([[1964]]). He  performed in other television productions, most notably ''[[Pinocchio]]'' ([[1968]]) and ''[[Roots (TV miniseries)|Roots]]'' ([[1977]]). He starred in two television series: ''[[O.K. Crackerby!]]'' (1965-1966) and ''[[The Bold Ones]]: The Lawyers'' (1969-1972).<br/>+<br/>+His favorite song was "[[There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly | I Know an Old Lady (Who Swallowed a Fly)]]"; supposedly he sang it at "every concert." <ref>"Burl Ives," ''New York Times'', Dec. 31, 1995, p.

[[Frank Black]] of the [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]] is a contemporary fan of Ives according to Apple's [[iTunes Music Store]]. In a contribution to “Celebrity Playlists”, Black includes no fewer than 15 of Ives' hits in his playlist.  [[Madison, Wisconsin]], [[punk rock]] band [[w:Killdozer (band)|Killdozer]] released the EP ''Burl'' in [[1986]], which they dedicated “in loving memory of” Ives, who was still alive (and evidently still remembered) at the time.<br/>+<br/>+[[The Ren and Stimpy Show]]'s first season episode "Stimpy's Invention” featured a record, “Happy Happy Joy Joy,” which parodied Ives' singing style and recreated some of his crusty dialogue from [[The Big Country]]. When Ives saw the episode, he contacted Ren and Stimpy Show creator [[John Kricfalusi]] and said that he would have been willing to do the voice-over work for it.<br/>+<br/>+Ives is known to ''[[Star Wars]]'' fans for his role as the narrator in the [[1984 in film|1984]] made-for-TV film ''[[Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure]]''. <br/>+<br/>+In his later years, Ives and his wife, Dorothy, lived with their children in a home located alongside the water in [[Anacortes, Washington|Anacortes]], in the [[Puget Sound]] area of [[Washington]], where he died of cancer of the mouth at the age of 85. Burl Ives is interred in Mound Cemetery in Jasper County, Illinois.<br/>+<br/>+==Discography==<br/>+===Albums===<br/>+* ''[[The Wayfaring Stranger (1941 Burl Ives album)|Okeh Presents The Wayfaring Stranger]]'' (1941, Okeh K-3, 4 records, 10 inch, 78 rpm)<br/>+* ''[[The Wayfaring Stranger (1944 Burl Ives album) | The Wayfaring Stranger]]'' (1944, Asch 345, 3 records, 10 inch, 78 rpm)<br/>+* ''[[BBC Presents The Martins and the Coys]]'' (1944, BBC World, 6 records, 12 inch, 78 rpm)<br/>+* ''[[A Collection of Ballads and Folk Songs]]'' (1945, Decca A-407, 4 records, 10 inch, 78 rpm)<br/>+* ''[[Sing Out, Sweet Land]] (1946, Decca A-404, 6 records, 10 inch, 78 rpm)<br/>+* ''[[Ballads and Folk Songs, Volume II]]'' (1947, Decca A-431, 4 records, 10 inch, 78 rpm)<br/>+* ''[[Animal Fair: Songs for Children]]'' (1948, Columbia  MJV 59, 2 records, 10 inch, 78 rpm)<br/>+* ''[[A Collection of Ballads, Folk and Country Songs]]'' (''c.'' 1949, Decca A-711, 3 records, 10 inch, 78 rpm)<br/>+* ''[[The Return of the Wayfaring Stranger]]'' (1949, Columbia C-186, 4 records, 10 inch, 78 rpm)<br/>+* ''[[Mother Goose Songs]]'' (1950, Columbia MJV 61, 10 inch, 78 rpm)<br/>+* ''[[Burl Ives Sings The Lollipop Tree, The Little Turtle, and The Moon Is the North Wind's Cookie]]'' (''c.'' 1950, Columbia MJV 110, 10 inch, 78 rpm)<br/>+* ''[[Lonesome Train: A Musical Legend]]'' (1944, Decca DA 375, 3 records, 12 inch, 78 rpm)<br/>+* ''[[More Folksongs by Burl Ives]]'' (1950, Columbia C-213, 4 records, 10 inch, 78 rpm)<br/>+* ''[[Hymns Sung by Burl Ives]]'' (1950, Columbia C-203, 4 records, 10 inch, 78 rpm)<br/>+* ''[[Historical America in Song]]'' (1950, 6 albums in 30 records, 12 inch, 78 rpm)<br/>+* ''[[Christmas Day in the Morning (Burl Ives album)|Christmas Day in the Morning]]'' (1952,  Decca DL 5428, 10 inch, 33 1/3 rpm)<br/>+* ''[[Women: Folksongs about the Fair Sex (album by Burl Ives) | Women: Folksongs about the Fair Sex]]'' (1953, Decca DL 5490, 10 inch, 33 1/3 rpm)<br/>+* ''[[Folk Songs Dramatic and Humorous (album by Burl Ives) | Folk Songs Dramatic and Humorous]]'' (1953, Decca DL 5467, 10 inch, 33 1/3 rpm)<br/>+* ''[[Coronation Concert (album by Burl Ives) | Coronation Concert]]'' (1954, Decca DL 8080, 12 inch, 33 1/3 rpm)<br/>+* ''[[The Wild Side of Life (album by Burl Ives) | The Wild Side of Life]]'' (1955, Decca DL 8107, 12 inch, 33 1/3 rpm)<br/>+* ''[[Men: Songs for and about Men (album by Burl Ives) | Men: Songs for and about Men]]'' (1955, Decca DL 8125, 12 inch, 33 1/3 rpm)<br/>+* ''[[Down to the Sea in Ships (album by Burl Ives) | Down to the Sea in Ships]]'' (1956, Decca DL 8245, 12 inch, 33 1/3 rpm)<br/>+* ''[[Burl Ives Sings In the Quiet of the Night (album) | Burl Ives Sings In the Quiet of the Night]]'' (1956,  Decca DL 8247)<br/>+* ''[[Burl Ives Sings for Fun (album) | Burl Ives Sings for Fun]]'' (1956,  Decca DL 8248)<br/>+* ''[[Burl Ives Sings Songs for All Ages (album) | Burl Ives Sings Songs for All Ages]]'' (1957, Columbia CL 980)<br/>+* ''[[Christmas Eve with Burl Ives (album) | Christmas Eve with Burl Ives]]'' (1957,  Decca DL 8391)<br/>+* ''[[Songs of Ireland (album by Burl Ives) | Songs of Ireland]]'' (1957, Decca DL 8444)<br/>+* ''[[Captain Burl Ives' Ark (album) | Captain Burl Ives' Ark]]'' (1957, Decca DL 8587)<br/>+* ''[[Old Time Varieties (album by Burl Ives) | Old Time Varieties]]'' (1958, Decca  DL 8637)<br/>+* ''[[Australian Folk Songs (album by Burl Ives) | Australian Folk Songs]]'' (1958, Decca DL 8749)<br/>+* ''[[Cheers (album by Burl Ives) | Cheers]]'' (1959, Decca DL 8886)<br/>+* ''[[Little White Duck and Other Songs (album by Burl Ives) | Little White Duck and Other Songs]]'' (1960, Harmony HL 9507)<br/>+* ''[[Burl Ives and the Korean Orphan Choir Sing of Faith and Joy (album) | Burl Ives and the Korean Orphan Choir Sing of Faith and Joy]]'' (1960s, Word W 3259)<br/>+* ''[[Burl Ives Sings Irving Berlin (album) | Burl Ives Sings Irving Berlin]]'' (c. 1960,  United Artists UAL 3117)<br/>+* ''[[Manhattan Troubadour (album by Burl Ives) | Manhattan Troubadour]]'' (1961,  United Artists Records UAS 6145)<br/>+* ''[[The Versatile Burl Ives!

Starting with 735 students, the studentry has more than doubled and continues to grow with each passing year. The Las Vegas Academy obtains wide recognition for its music arts program, especially some of the better known departments including band, orchestra and guitar.<br/>-<br/>-== Academics ==<br/>-Las Vegas Academy students use a block schedule for the 8-period class schedule, attending 4 classes a day each 86 minutes long.

The service is broadcast from the All Asia Broadcast Centre (ABC) located in [[Bukit Jalil]], [[Kuala Lumpur]], Malaysia.  Astro is owned by MEASAT Broadcast Network Systems, a subsidiary of [[Astro All Asia Networks plc]].<br/>+<br/>+==General Information==<br/>+The service was launched in [[1996]] following the launch of [[MEASAT|MEASAT-1]] satellite on January 1996 with an initial bouquet of 22 television and 8 radio channels.<br/>+Currently, the service consists of 56 television, 17 radio, and 4 [[pay per view]] channels plus various interactive services. The television service comprises five of the six Malaysian [[terrestrial television|terrestrial TV]] networks (RTM 1, RTM 2, TV3, ntv7 and 8TV. TV9 is set to be included in the Astro once [[MEASAT|MEASAT 3]] is launched [http://portalilmu.kempen.gov.my/index.php?ch=24&pg=310&ac=10508].), a number of [[vernacular]] channels (packaged in house by ASTRO), as well as a selection of international English and Chinese language networks. Astro's own News Channel carries programming from the [[Arabic language]] news channel [[Al Jazeera]], dubbed in [[Malay language|Malay]], as well as from [[Australia]]'s [[ABC Asia Pacific]].<br/>+<br/>+Channels broadcast on the Astro service are delayed, with time varying from several seconds to an hour for the movie and music channels (i.e. [[Star Movies]], [[Cinemax]], [[Channel V]] and [[MTV]]), from their source feeds using a digital server system. This delay is used to edit programming to comply with the governmental guidelines on foreign and unsuitable content, as well as to facilitate commercial replacement, as local laws prohibit the broadcast of commercials produced overseas.<br/>+<br/>+On August 11, 2006, Astro announced the launch of seven new channels, which would start broadcasting from August 31. They include three Astro branded channels packaged in-house (Ceria, Aruna & Kirana), two Chinese language channels (WaTV & CCTV4), a Hindi channel (ZEE TV) and 24-hour anime channel (Animax). These channels are available at no additional charge to existing subscribers until February 28, 2007. New subscribers who sign-up after September 30, 2006 will be subject to channel package fees.<br/>+<br/>+Astro has previously announced that it would introduce 50 new channels with the launch of the [[MEASAT|MEASAT-3]] satellite. However, delays affecting the manufacture of the satellite and problems with the launch vehicle has pushed back the launch of the satellite from mid-2005 to an expected launch date on December 12, 2006. Details on what new channels will be launched have not been released by the company, however this service expansion is scheduled to occur about eight weeks after the launch of [[MEASAT|MEASAT-3]]. A channel repackaging exercise is also scheduled soon after the expansion occurs [http://biz.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2006/8/12/business/15126472&sec=business].<br/>+<br/>+==Service & Technical Information==<br/>+[[Image:102_0242.JPG|thumb|right|A typical Astro [[satellite dish]] or a [[mini-dish]].]]<br/>+<br/>+The ''direct-to-home'' service, branded as Direct-to-U (DTU), is broadcast as high-power [[Ku-band]] transmissions utilising the transponders of the [[MEASAT]] satellite system. Reception of the service signals uses a fixed 60cm diameter dish antenna.<br/>+<br/>+Although Ku-band signals can be affected by rain attenuation ([[rain fade]]), making it susceptible to frequent outages in heavy rainfall areas such as Malaysia, the operators of Astro have employed a tailor-made system to boost power of the satellite delivery system to overcome this problem. The advertised service availability of 99.7%, however, is still a topic of much debate by subscribers.<br/>+<br/>+The Astro broadcast signals are [[DVB|DVB-S]] compliant and compressed using the [[MPEG-2]] standards. The signals are also [[encoded]] and [[encrypted]] prior to transmission forming a [[conditional access]] subscriber service, allowing access only to subscribers with a [[decoder]] and authorised [[smartcard]].<br/>+<br/>+The Astro service uses the package pricing model commonly used by other [[pay-TV]] operators in which channels are grouped into packages (i.e. [[wiktionary:basic|basic]] and [[premium]]) made available to [[subscriber]]s at a monthly fee. The basic packages are categorized into five groups: Learning (documentaries), Fun (kids & cartoons), Variety, Sports and News. Premium packages include Movies, Dynasty (Chinese language) and Emperor (Chinese language). Subscribers are required to select a minimum of 3 basic packages. All subscribers also receive 20 channels, grouped under the Astro Family banner, that includes five of the six local [[free-to-air]] terrestrial television networks (it is expected that the sixth free-to-air channel, TV9, will be added soon), in-house vernacular channels and some international networks. Subscribers also are able to access all the radio channels at no extra charge.<br/>+<br/>+===Receiver/Decoder===<br/>+Since its launch, Astro has introduced 3 generations of receiver/decoders.<br/>+<br/>+{| class="wikitable"<br/>+|-<br/>+!

This decoder will enable Astro subscribers to record up to 60 hours of programming on a 80GB hard disk. The system records programming without converting the MPEG-2 digital satellite stream, as such the recorded video is the same high quality as the broadcast feed. Inclusion of 2 tuners enables the recording of one programme, while viewing another. However, the system is not able to record two channels/programmes at the same time.<br/>+<br/>+Astro MAX includes standard features found on digital video recorders such as pausing, rewinding and replaying "live" TV as well as a 30 second skip. The unit also has a 30 minute buffer which constantly records the currently watched program. Full integration with Astro's electronic programme guide enables easy selection of programmes to be recorded. Additional features include the ability to record all audio tracks and all subtitle tracks on multiple language programming. Copies of programmes recorded can also be transferred to DVD or VHS tape.<br/>+<br/>+At present there is no service fee for the use of the Astro MAX system.<br/>+<br/>+==Channel line-up (Malaysia)==<br/>+===ASTRO FAMILY (General)===<br/>+* Channel 1 -

The service, called @stronet-JARING, was to be a one-way terrestrial return system, whereby Malaysian [[Internet service provider|ISP]] [[Jaring]] would provide the outbound data service through [[dial-up]] access. Downloads would be received via the [[MEASAT]] satellite system, which promised a maximum download speed of 6.5Mbit/s. A [[personal computer|PC]]-based trial was performed in early [[2000]] with a maximum download speed of 400kbit/s. Other proposed services included [[Multicast|Multicast File Transfer]] and [[Multicast|Multicast Streaming Delivery]]. The service, however, has never been made available publicly. (Ade, Depok)<br/>+<br/>+In May [[2005]], Astro launched [http://www.astro.tv/ Astro.tv], a broadband TV portal. It currently has two video channels: Akademi Fantasia Xtra and [[GOALTV]].

The Red Button feature is also used to provide [[interactive]] services such as programming updates, event news, scores, contest information and [[sponsor]] advertising.

If the ball is not given enough [[velocity]], then it will not roll over the hill. This scenario makes sense from the standpoint of [[classical mechanics]], but is an inapplicable restriction in quantum mechanics simply because quantum mechanical objects do not behave like classical objects such as balls. On a quantum scale, objects exhibit wavelike behavior. For a [[Self-energy|quantum particle]] moving against a [[potential well|potential energy "hill"]], the [[wavefunction|wave function]] describing the [[Elementary particle|particle]] can extend to the other side of the hill. This wave represents the probability of finding the particle in a certain location, meaning that the particle has the possibility of being detected on the other side of the hill. This behavior is called '''tunnelling'''; it is as if the particle has 'dug' through the potential hill. <br/> <br/>+As this is a quantum and non-classical effect, it can generally only be seen in [[Nanoparticle|nanoscopic phenomena]] — where the wave nature of particles is more pronounced.<br/> <br/>+Availability of [[energy level|states]] is necessary for tunneling to occur. In the above example, the quantum mechanical ball will not appear ''inside'' the hill because there is no available "space" for it to exist, but it can tunnel to the other side of the hill, where there is free space. Analogously, a particle can tunnel through the barrier, but unless there are states available within the barrier, the particle can only tunnel to the other side of the barrier. The wavefunction describing a particle only expresses the probability of finding the particle at a location assuming a free state exists. <br/> <br/>+==History and consequences==<br/>+In the early [[1900]]s, [[radioactive]] materials were known to have characteristic [[exponential decay|exponential]] decay rates or [[half-life|half lives]].  At the same time, [[Electromagnetic radiation|radiation emissions]] were known to have certain [[characteristic energy|characteristic energies]]. By [[1928]], [[George Gamow]] had solved the theory of the [[alpha decay]] of a [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] via tunnelling. Classically, the particle is confined to the nucleus because of the high energy requirement to escape the very strong [[potential]]. Classically, it takes an enormous amount of energy to pull apart the nucleus. In quantum mechanics, however, there is a probability the particle can tunnel through the potential and escape. Gamow solved a model potential for the nucleus and derived a relationship between the half-life of the particle and the energy of the emission.<br/> <br/>-=== Sources ===<br/>-<!-- STEP 3: Fill in the empty space below with at least one PUBLISHED,      --><br/>-<!--         SPECIFIC source for the information, like a book, or a page on  --><br/>-<!--         a reputable website.

Shortly thereafter, both groups considered whether particles could also tunnel into the nucleus.<br/> <br/>+After attending a [[seminar]] by Gamow, [[Max Born]] recognized the generality of quantum-mechanical tunnelling. He realised that tunnelling phenomena was not restricted to [[nuclear physics]], but was a general result of quantum mechanics that applies to many different systems. Today the theory of tunnelling is even applied to the early [[physical cosmology|cosmology]] of the [[universe]].<br/> <br/>+Quantum tunnelling was later applied to other situations, such as the [[cold emission]] of [[electrons]], and perhaps most importantly [[semiconductor]] and [[superconductor]] physics. Phenomena such as [[field emission]], important to [[flash memory]], are explained by quantum tunnelling. Tunnelling is a source of major current leakage in [[Very-large-scale integration|Very-large-scale integration (VLSI)]] electronics, and results in the substantial power drain and heating effects that plague high-speed and mobile technology.<br/> <br/>+Another major application is in electron-tunnelling microscopes (see [[scanning tunnelling microscope]]) which can resolve objects that are too small to see using conventional microscopes. Electron tunnelling microscopes overcome the limiting effects of conventional microscopes ([[optical aberration]]s, [[wavelength]] limitations) by scanning the surface of an object with tunnelling [[electron]]s.<br/> <br/>-<!-- ------ You're done!

The reciever runs about 12 yards striaght up (like a fly route) then makes a 45 degree break towards the sideline. Typically the catch is made just over the reciever's outside shoulder. This route is particuarlly difficult because rarely can the ball be "bulleted" to the receiever; instead to beat the cornerback (who is covering the wideout) the quarterback must pass over the corner's head.

What we have are the approximate solutions away from the potential hill and beneath the potential hill.

Given the 2 coefficients on one side of the classical turning point, we should be able to determine the 2 coefficients on the other side of the classical turning point by using this local solution to connect them. We should be able to find a relationship between <math>C,\theta</math> and <math>C_{+},C_{-}</math>.<br/>+<br/>+Fortunately the Bessel function solutions will asymptote into sine, cosine and exponential functions in the proper limits.

The author provides this solely as an essay of personal intent and rationale for certain actions.''' <br/>+|-<br/>+|}<br/>+==Statement==<br/>+My purpose for being an RC patroller on Wikipedia is unclear to me. Either I like the false sense of authority it brings, or I am simply satiating my obsessive tendencies. Many people have an addiction to Wikipedia, and this is true even for people who rarely contribute actual content, like myself. Either way, I like to preserve order, and I like seeing that done in an orderly way.<br/> <br/>-----<br/>+I also really like Wikipedia, as it has helped me out in a lot of situations. I'm not an expert on anything, but I feel compelled to improve the site in some way, so counter-vandalism it is. This is more of a statement of admiration than one of perceived indebtedness.<br/>+<br/>+I'm a secretive, nervous person. I am happy to help out, but I take some caution at giving out personal details or contact information. I am especially paranoid about attending conventions involving people I know only through the Internet. Please don't be mad at me about these things -- that also makes me nervous.<br/>+<br/>+==Confession==<br/>+I admit it: I am very annoyed by vandals, and I sometimes take delight in seeing them blocked. I know this is a biased perspective, but I try to keep a level head most of the time. I lose my cool sometimes, though -- when a blatant vandal pretends like he or she has done no wrong and deserves to edit Wikipedia however they want, for example, [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Omicronpersei8&diff=63034218&oldid=63030002 I don't feel obligated to shower them with muffins and puppies]. I do not, however, intend to bring a vandal-hating spirit to Wikipedia, nor do I do countervandalism in order to harass or block other users.<br/>+<br/>+==Usual methods==<br/>+I am a recent changes patroller, which means I [[User:Omicronpersei8/RC|patrol]] [[Special:recentchanges|recent changes]]. Because non-logged in users are more likely to commit vandalism, I almost always [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Recentchanges&hideliu=1 filter out the logged in ones]. I do this because although sock puppets and newly registered vandals may get a free pass from me, I feel that they are easily lost among all the legitimate edits. When combining both logged in edits and IP edits in one list, the anonymous vandalisms are even more easily drowned.<br/>+<br/>+On patrol, I use my custom quickie link page at [[User:Omicronpersei8/RC]], because I'm still relatively new and don't have everything committed to memory, and also [[WP:VPRF|VandalProof]] as of late. It's a good tool, but when I use it, it is on my slow Windows machine. This explains some of my erroneous edits and my occasional sluggishness. My faster machines run Linux, but I have been unable so far to get VandalProof running on them via [[Wine (software)|Wine]].<br/>+<br/>+I use Google frequently when I have a question about an article's or section's notability. When I resort to Google, I usually do not go to any other lengths to establish credibility. Some will argue that a Google search is not a comprehensive enough tool to certify that a subject deserves a Wikipedia article. I disagree, because I feel the Internet has been around long enough to be a reliable echo not only of popular interests, but of almost anything of any note.<br/>+<br/>+I feel I know how to perform Google searches correctly, so when my query fails to turn up at least a few hundred results, I bring the subject's validity into question. <br/>+<br/>+==Mistakes I know I have made==<br/>+Here is an imcomplete list of mistakes I have made and will make again. Please [[User_talk:Omicronpersei8|contact me]] when I do.<br/>+<br/>+===Naive drive-by judgments===<br/>+Sometimes I will see an edit that is apropos but does not seem it at first glance; one example is when I reverted what I thought was a [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Offensive_terms_per_nationality&diff=next&oldid=61702323 racist, nonsensical addition] to an article, not realizing, even after giving dictionary.com a cursory glance, that it was [http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=spic a completely valid edit]. I honestly do try to examine edits before I do away with them, but sometimes I do not invest enough time or insight into my process. In my defense, it's a type of mistake most people make occasionally.<br/>+<br/>+===Inappropriate deletion tagging===<br/>+On occasion, I take my concerns to the talk page. More often, if it is an article with no links, sections, methods of verifying claims, one which makes express usage of the first person, or one which resembles an advertisement, I put it up for deletion.<br/>+<br/>+Historically, I have been more inclined towards [[WP:SD|speedy deletes]] than [[WP:PROD|proposed deletions]] or [[WP:AFD|AFDs]]. Naturally, not all of my nominations have been successful. This means I have either incorrectly labelled a legitimate article as illegitimate, or have used the wrong means of doing away with an article. It has not been a rare event for me to request speedy deletion for an article that should be discussed first, or vice versa.<br/>+<br/>+===Assuming bad faith===<br/>+I am certainly not infallible in my viewpoints, and after dealing with vandals for a while, one tends to temporarily lose one's sense of humor. I have my own opinions about what is and isn't a valid edit, and when I feel someone has not made a decent improvement in his or her edits, it is easier than usual to assume that an individual does not have Wikipedia's best interests in mind. Vandalism has [[WP:(|several different forms]], one of which is stealthy inclusion of what may be considered nonsense. I tend to justify myself in holding opinions such as these, but I do regret when I mistake a valid editor for a vandal. In truth, I do need more work at [[WP:AGF|assuming good faith]]. I try to be discerning, sensible, and perceptive; sometimes, this causes me to instead be rude, condemning, untrusting, temperamental, or egotistical. The best way to deal with me in such an instance is to either [[User_talk:Omicronpersei8|talk to me about it]] or [[WP:AN/I|report me]] if that has failed.<br/>+<br/>+===Erroneous reverting of blankings===<br/>+One of the first lines of [[WP:ES]] states:<br/>+<div style="text-indent: 3em; font-style: italic;">An edit summary should strive to answer the question, "Why did you make this edit?".</div><br/>+<i><b>Please</b> include edit comments when you blank.</i> God knows I don't include edit summaries with all of my edits, sometimes even when I should, but simply removing someone's addition altogether needs to be qualified.<br/>+<br/>+Generally, the most research I will do when I see an IP blanking is search back through the user's history for that article alone. I can easily ignore one section being removed without an edit comment, but two trips my alarm. Large, multi-section deletions are often deserving of reversion almost without question.<br/>+<br/>+==Conclusion: A plea for understanding==<br/>+Why do people get so angry when I revert their edits? Either because they put time and effort into something that I did away with in the click of a button, or because they resent having their claims questioned, possibly as a result of having a large ego. I believe the first situation is the more frequent one.<br/>+<br/>+I try not to revert without a valid reason, and anyway, edits are kept in history for you to restore at your heart's content, as long as [[WP:3RR]] is observed. I try to avoid letting edit wars become a habit, and probably won't do a second revert, unless I am dealing with something that obviously should be removed. I am usually happy to discuss my actions, and I will usually admit when I am wrong, as long as civility is maintained.<br/>+<br/>+In my experiences, most IP edits to Wikipedia are to articles in the human interest or entertainment categories, and thus objectivity is especially hard to find. Perhaps relatedly, most IP edits do not include sources with their claims or additions.<br/>+<br/>+''Most'' of Wikipedia is unsourced, so one must use his or her wits to sort out the gold from the nonsense.

Cain]] that first appeared in [[1935]] in abridged, 8-part [[serial]] form in ''Liberty'' Magazine.  It was directed by Wilder.  The story was based on a [[1927]] crime perpetrated by a married Queens woman and her lover. [[Ruth Snyder|Ruth (Brown) Snyder]] persuaded her boyfriend Judd Gray to kill her husband Albert, after having her spouse take out a big insurance policy - with a double-indemnity clause. The murderers were quickly identified and arrested.   <sup id="fn_1_back">[[#fn_1|1]]</sup><br/>-<br/>-<br/>-Other films inspired by the Snyder-Gray murder include [[The Postman Always Rings Twice]], and [[Body Heat]].  "Postman" and "Double Indemnity" were also remade in the 1980s.<br/>-<br/>-==Characters==<br/>-{{spoiler}}<br/>-The main characters include:<br/>-*Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) - an [[insurance]] salesman.<br/>-*Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck) - an unhappily married wife who seduces Neff.<br/>-*Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson) - a [[statistician]] who works in Neff's insurance company.<br/>-<br/>-== Plot ==<br/>-The film tells the story of an insurance salesman (MacMurray) who finds himself entwined in a plot to kill a woman's husband.   A tenacious investigator (Robinson) thinks it's foul play and may suspect his co-worker and the recently widowed ''[[femme fatale]]''.  <br/>-<br/>-The title of the film is a reference to a frequently-found provision in many [[life insurance]] policies in which an amount twice the amount which would normally be paid to the beneficiary becomes payable in the event of the [[accident]]al death of the insured.  An alternate ending was shot for the film (to appease censors) featuring killer MacMurray going to the gas chamber.  This footage is lost but stills of the scene still exist.<br/>-<br/>-== Critical response ==<br/>-Today, the film is considered a classic.  Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] in his review of the film praises the director Wilder and [[cinematographer]] Seitz:  "The photography by [[John F. Seitz]] helped develop the noir style of sharp-edged shadows and shots, strange angles and lonely [[Edward Hopper]] settings."  A review of the film in the [[New York Times]] September 7, 1944 gave the film a negative review.  Reviewer [[Bosley Crowther]] found Edward G. Robinson's supporting role excellent but also stated "Such folks as delight in murder stories for their academic elegance alone should find this one steadily diverting, despite its monotonous pace and length. Indeed, the fans of James M. Cain's tough fiction might gloat over it with gleaming joy."<br/>-<br/>-[[Woody Allen]] considers this film to be the greatest ever made. {{fact}}<br/>-<br/>-==Elements of ''Film Noir''==<br/>-[[image:Doublei.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Stanwyck and MacMurray in ''Double Indemnity'']]<br/>-''Double Indemnity'' is an excellent example of a [[genre]] of films called ''[[film noir]]''. Its [[plot]] and style contains almost all the elements that make up classic ''film noir'':<br/>-<br/>-*Characters commit brutal, vengeful, and often psychopathic acts of violence.<br/>-*The plot is about how a crime is committed and the story is told from the [[Point of view (literature)|point of view]] of the criminal.  In the case of ''Double Indemnity'', the plot is literally told from the point of view of the criminal.  The entire plot (except the very first [[scene (filming)|scenes]] and the very last scenes) is told in [[flashback (literary technique)|flashback]] by Walter Neff, who commits murder and very nearly gets away with it.<br/>-*''Double Indemnity'', like many other ''films noir'', takes a [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] view of human nature.  This is due in part to the flashback [[structure]] of the film.  As everything in ''Double Indemnity'' described by Neff into the dictating machine clearly happened in the past, and there is no way in the present or future to alter events that occurred in the past, it is evident that the events leading up to the eventual execution of Neff were inevitable and were due mostly to Neff’s nature as a weak-willed man in the hands of a ''femme fatale''.<br/>-*[[Theme (literature)|Themes]] about how sexuality and psychology are interwoven emerge.<br/>-*Moody lighting including Venetian blind effects on the walls and on characters’ faces in some scenes look like bars on a jail and make the characters of ''Double Indemnity'' seem as though they are trapped by their human weaknesses and doomed to failure.  The cinematographic compositions and the art direction are particularly claustrophobic as well.  Characters are often backed into corner where mobility is impossible (such as in cars or telephone booths).<br/>-<br/>-==Trivia==<br/>-Fred MacMurray, a bachelor in the film, is always seen wearing a wedding ring.<br/>-<br/>-Judd Gray, the man on whom MacMurray's Neff character was loosely based, said when he confessed, after killing Albert Snyder, “When I walked I listened for my step – no sound seemed to follow.” Neff says, “I couldn’t hear my footsteps.  It was the walk of a dead man.” <br/>-<br/>-<br/>-== Awards ==<br/>-''Double Indemnity'' was listed at number 38 on the [[American Film Institute]]'s list of the top 100 American films of all time.<br/>-<br/>-It was nominated for [[Academy Awards]] for <br/>-*[[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress in a Leading Role]] (Barbara Stanwyck) <br/>-*[[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography, Black-and-White]] <br/>-*[[Academy Award for Directing|Best Director]] (Billy Wilder) <br/>-*[[Academy Award for Original Music Score|Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture]]<br/>-*[[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]<br/>-*[[Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay|Best Writing, Screenplay]].<br>  <br/>-This film noir received no Academy Awards.<br><br/>-<br/>-The film has been selected for preservation in the '''United States [[National Film Registry]]'''.<br/>-<br/>-== Quotes ==<br/>-<br/>-'''Walter''' (MacMurray): ''It was a hot afternoon, and I can still remember the smell of honeysuckle all along that street.

Replays of the show can be heard throughout the day on [[Howard 100]] and various times on [[Howard 101]]. <br/>+<br/>+The "King of All Media" (the title was a joking reference to [[Michael Jackson]]'s appellation "The King of Pop") has been dubbed a [[shock jock]] for his highly [[controversy|controversial]] use of [[scatology|scatological]], sexual and racial humor, and [[exploitation]] of his guests. Stern and many of his fans hate the term "Shock Jock." He has said himself, "The show was never about shocking people."{{fact}}  Rather he claims that the main thing he offers on the air is his honest opinion, which can be given on any issue ranging from world affairs to the weight problems of a co-worker. Some of his commentaries are perceived by many to include [[bigot]]ed, [[misanthrope|misanthropic]] and [[misogyny|misogynistic]] remarks about various [[religious]] and [[ethnic]] groups, women and men - though one of his trademarks is that he makes fun of everyone equally, even himself. He is one of the highest-paid radio personalities in the [[United States]] and the most fined personality in radio broadcast history.<br/>+<br/>+He is best-known for his national radio show, which for many years was [[radio syndication|syndicated]] on [[FM broadcasting|FM]] [[radio stations]] (and a few [[AM broadcasting|AM]] stations) throughout the [[United States]] until his last broadcast via [[terrestrial radio]] on [[December 16]], [[2005]]. He began broadcasting via the subscription-based [[Sirius Satellite Radio|Sirius]] [[satellite radio]] service on [[January 9]], [[2006]].<br/>+<br/>+His national television shows include ''The Howard Stern Show'' on [[WWOR-TV]], which ran in the early 1990s; ''Howard Stern'', consisting of segments from his radio show, which ran from 1994 to 2005 on [[E!]]; and ''The Howard Stern Radio Show'', which ran from 1998 to 2001 in syndication. ''The Howard Stern Show'' was a weekly skit-driven show that was produced in the [[Secaucus, New Jersey]] studios of WWOR-TV and shown in selected markets. The other shows were produced from video footage of his live radio broadcast.<br/>+<br/>+Since [[November 18]], [[2005]], ''Howard TV'' has been available on television through the [[iN DEMAND]] [[video on demand]] pay service that various [[cable TV]] systems offer. Currently, this includes uncensored versions of shows which previously aired on [[E!]] and video from his Sirius show. Howard TV also includes movies (Ex. [[Supertwink]]), skits, bits, wack packer videos, behind-the-scenes videos and anything else related to the show.  <br/>+<br/>+In 2006 Howard was elected into [[Time Magazine]]'s "Time 100: The People who shape our world" <ref>{{cite news <br/>+ |author = David Spade<br/>+ |url = http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,1187317,00.html<br/>+ |title = Howard Stern New King of Satellite<br/>+ |publisher = Time Magazine<br/>+ |date = May, 2006<br/>+}}</ref><br/>+and was ranked #7 in [[Forbes Magazine]]'s annual Celebrity 100<ref>[http://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/53/5S85.html Top 100 Most Powerful Celebrities] Forbes.com, June 2006</ref>, which lists the most influential celebrities in the world.<br/>+<br/>+==Early life and career==<br/>+Howard Stern was born into a [[American Jews|Jewish American]] family in [[Roosevelt, New York|Roosevelt]], [[Long Island]], [[New York]]. His father, Ben, owned a recording studio in Manhattan, and Howard developed an interest in broadcasting as a child when he would accompany his father to work. Although both his parents are Jewish, Stern long claimed on his show to be "a half-Jew" and "half-Italian" via his mother Rae. This claim is most likely a comedy bit, as Stern sometimes utters [[Yiddish]] phrases on the air and says he is speaking in [[Italian language|Italian]]. [[Gilbert Gottfried]] joked about his supposed "half-Jewishness" at Stern's 2006 birthday party, making [[tongue-in-cheek]] [[anti-Semitic]] comments. Stern's Hebrew name is Tzvi; his paternal grandparents, Froim and Anna (Gallar) Stern, and maternal grandparents, Sol and Esther (Reich) Schiffman, were Jews from Austria-Hungary who immigrated to America at about the same time.<br/>+<br/>+Stern often said that his parents "abused" him as a child, and presumptions of verbal abuse were confirmed when Stern played old family recordings during a 1990 broadcast.{{fact}}  Many pieces of those old recordings have become [[soundbites]], with such paternal gems as, "I told you not to be stupid, you moron" and "Shut up! Sit down!" being screamed at a 7-year-old Howard. These old recordings were later used in a parody commercial for the "Ben Stern School of Broadcasting", which specialized in graduating self-loathing and emotionally disturbed workaholic media leaders. Stern said his mother ran her house with "the intensity of [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]" and that his father often called him a moron. However, he also has stated this was just part of his gimmick and that his parents were warm, loving and supportive.<br/>+<br/>+Stern attended [[Roosevelt Junior-Senior High School|Roosevelt Junior High School]], where he was one of the few white students in a predominantly [[African American]] school, until 1969. Stern's family then moved, and he attended [[South Side High School]], where he graduated in 1972 <ref>[http://www.newsday.com/features/custom/ithappened/longisland/ny-iholi0217story,0,1149101.htmlstory?coll=ny-rightrail-bottompromo It Happened In Long Island] Newsday</ref>. In 1976 he received his [[Bachelor's degree]] in communications from [[Boston University]], carrying a 3.8 [[GPA]] where he had worked (before being fired) as a volunteer at the campus radio station [[WTBU]]. Stern now awards at scholarship<ref>[http://www.bu.edu/bulletins/com/item19.html Office of Financial Aid] Boston University</ref> at [[Boston University]]. <br/>+<br/>+[[Image:SternWRNW.jpeg|left|thumb|border|24-year-old Stern at WRNW, circa February 1978.]]<br/>+<br/>+After graduation, he worked as a disc jockey for WRNW in Briarcliff Manor, located in [[Westchester County, New York]] playing [[rock music]]. He discovered a talent for [[Lenny Bruce]]-type comedy, and developed a wide-ranging confrontational style. In 1978, Stern landed his first morning show job in [[Hartford, Connecticut]] at WCCC-FM and WCCC-AM. The radio stations with a progressive rock format lend itself nicely to developing Howard's "free-form" personality. It was at the Hartford radio station where Howard also met his future show writer and producer, [[Fred Norris]], who was working as an overnight deejay as well. He migrated to an FM radio station in [[Detroit, Michigan]] (WWWW known as W4). After developing his show at W4 (and after the station moved to a country format) he moved on to [[Washington, D.C.]] (putting in a year at DC101 and making it the #1 station in town in the process), and returned to New York in 1982 to work at NBC's flagship AM radio station WNBC-AM. Also working at NBC was [[David Letterman]], who became a fan of Stern's radio show. Stern's guest appearance on ''Late Night with David Letterman'' on [[June 19]], [[1984]], launched Stern into the national spotlight and gave his radio show unprecedented exposure. Stern would appear on Letterman's show many times thereafter.<br/>+<br/>+Stern and his crew were fired from NBC in 1985, ostensibly in response to a particularly outrageous sketch — "Bestiality Dial-A-Date" — although relations between station management and Stern had been strained from the beginning. He quickly returned to the FM band by joining local rival station WXRK, premiering on November 18, 1985 and returning permanently to morning drive in February 1986. Stern's show was syndicated nationwide starting in 1986 by [[Infinity Broadcasting]]. The program made great sport of feuding with other cities' top-rated DJs, and soon Stern's broadcast was #1 in important markets including [[Philadelphia]] and [[Los Angeles]]. His Arbitron numbers were strongest in the country's #1 radio market, New York, where his morning ratings more than tripled his station's average numbers the rest of the day.<br/>+<br/>+On [[June 4]], [[1978]], Stern married his college sweetheart, Alison Berns, at Temple Ohabei Shalom in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]]. They have three daughters: Emily Beth (b. 1983), Deborah Jennifer (b. 1986) and Ashley Jade (b. 1993). A hallmark of Stern's humor was that he often expressed how tempted he was by the [[strippers]], [[porn stars]], and [[lesbian]]s who appeared on his show, but always insisted that he had to be faithful to his wife. In October of 1999, Stern announced that Alison was divorcing him, due to the fact that he is a workaholic. The couple's divorce proceeding resulted in a settlement, and Alison remarried in 2001 to David Simon. Howard soon started a period of single living in Manhattan, in which it's come to be revealed he dated dozens of women including [[Angie Everhart]] and [[Robin Givens]]. Despite spending time with [[Carmen Electra]] a reported "5 times" during this period, as revealed on the 07/29/02 show, Howard and Carmen deny anything more intimate than an outdoor shower in bathing suits took place. Since early 2000, Stern has been dating model [[Beth Ostrosky]], who is 19 years his junior. Ostrosky frequently appears in the men's magazine [[FHM]].<br/>+<br/>+==Terrestrial Radio Show==<br/>+In one typical example of his radio show, he persuaded a female caller to have [[phone sex]] with him on the air. He made deep buzzing noises into his microphone, and had her sit on a speaker with the volume turned up until she reached an on-the-air orgasm. Another notable episode was on WWDC-FM (DC101 Radio) in Washington, D.C., in which Stern called [[Air Florida]] and asked what the fare was for a one-way ticket from [[Washington National Airport]] to the 14th Street Bridge (on the [[Potomac River]], less than 1 mile from the airport). He was making light of the crash of [[Air Florida Flight 90]] one day earlier, on [[January 13]], [[1982]], which had killed 78 persons (both onboard the airplane and in vehicles stopped in traffic on the bridge). That June 29, Stern was fired from DC-101 radio after being suspended for criticizing his station management and two other radio stations. Stern's lawyer alleged, "It's our view that the real reason they've [fired Stern] is they would like to get new DC-101 deejays '[[The Greaseman|GreaseMan]]' and 'Adam Smasher' on the air as soon as possible, and hope the audience forgets about Howard, and that's a perfectly rational business judgment."<br/>+<br/>+Stern has also shown the ability to take society's misfits and turn them into celebrities through [[The Wack Pack]]. Wack Pack members are able to parlay their exposure on Stern's show into personal appearances at clubs and even the occasional movie.<br/>+<br/>+Stern has referred to himself as the "King of All Media," a parody of [[Michael Jackson]]'s claiming of the title "King of Pop." To his subjects this title is true, as they have been loyal consumers of The King's books, [[pay-per-view]] events, and movies. Stern believes he represents the future of America, where, in keeping with a longstanding trend, public moral standards will continue to loosen. His show was frequently the subject of complaints by various listeners who find his deliveries offensive - something he deliberately encourages. Fines were occasionally issued against radio stations airing his show, generally for violating FCC requirements regarding content. Still, the parent conglomerate that hosted Stern's show, Infinity Broadcasting (a subsidiary of Viacom), seemed to consider those fines a necessary price to pay in order to support Stern's continuing popularity.<br/>+<br/>+As of November 2004, the show, typically airing in the morning, was syndicated on 45 radio stations all across the U.S. (27 owned by Infinity Broadcasting), down from Stern's peak syndication of 62 stations. Those stations were not allowed to stream the show over the internet.<br/>+<br/>+===1990s===<br/>+In 1992, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) fined Infinity Broadcasting $600,000 after Stern discussed [[masturbation|masturbating]] to a picture of [[Aunt Jemima]]. His exact statement was, "The closest I came to making love to a black woman was I, uh, masturbated to a picture of Aunt Jemima on a pancake box. I did it right on her kerchief."{{fact}} <br/>+<br/>+In 1993, Stern released his [[autobiography]], ''[[Private Parts (book)|Private Parts]]''. The book was a [[best-seller]] and became the fastest selling book in [[Simon & Schuster]]'s history. <br/>+<br/>+In 1994, Stern embarked on a political campaign for Governor of New York, formally announcing his candidacy under the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] ticket. Although he legally qualified for the office and campaigned for a time after his nomination, many viewed the run for office as nothing more than a publicity stunt. He subsequently withdrew his candidacy because he did not want to comply with the financial disclosure requirements for candidates. He claimed that he had ultimately decided to support the Republican, [[George Pataki]], who wound up winning over incumbent [[Mario Cuomo]], and Stern was seen shaking Pataki's hand on television in congratulation.<br/>+<br/>+In March 1995, one day before the funeral of slain Tejano singer [[Selena Quintanilla]], Stern played the sounds of gunshots in the background over some of her music. He also made comments that were considered racist by many people, such as "[[Alvin and the Chipmunks]] have more soul," and "Spanish people have the worst taste in music...they have no depth."{{fact}}  After pressure from his radio station, Stern gave an on-air apology a week later in Spanish.  In August 1995, Howard was awarded the infamous "number 1 worst dressed male" on [[Mr. Blackwell]]'s list.{{fact}} <br/>+<br/>+In 1996, Stern released his second book, ''Miss America'', which focused more on his radio career. Like his first book, it was also a bestseller.<br/>+<br/>+[[Image:Howardstern_book1.jpg|left|100px|thumb|border|''Private Parts'' [[paperback]] cover]]<br/>+<br/>+In 1997, Stern's autobiography, ''Private Parts'', was adapted to [[Private Parts|film]]. The movie did moderately well at box offices and in video release, garnering a total of over $60 million. He had also announced plans for a film provisionally titled ''The Adventures of Fartman''. based on a character created for his appearance at the [[MTV Video Music Awards]] in 1992. As of 2006, this project has not begun pre-production.<br/>+<br/>+Being a personality that engenders strong reactions from people, Stern has had his share of stalkers and death threats. On January 15, 1998 Lance Carvin, who had been stalking Stern, was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for threatening to kill Stern and his family.<br/>+<br/>+His [[April 21]], [[1999]] show drew angry criticism and official "censure" from the [[Colorado]] State Legislature for his comment regarding the motives of the two male students who murdered 12 classmates and one teacher in the [[Columbine High School massacre]] in Colorado: "There were some really good-looking girls running out with their hands over their heads. Did those kids try to have sex with any of the good-looking girls? They didn't even do that? At least if you're going to kill yourself and kill all the kids, why wouldn't you have some sex? If I was going to kill some people, I'd take them out with sex." {{fact}} Stern did not apologize for his words but instead argued that his comments were an attempt to figure out what was wrong with the two attackers. Stern believes much of the furor was roused by deejays at competing stations in the Denver market. He said, "There has been a tragic shooting in Denver. It's a national horror and what are the deejays doing? They're announcing my sponsors trying to get them to pull out. Are they really caring about the Denver community, or are they really just saying, 'Hey, maybe we can get Howard Stern off the air?' If I'm so vicious, why would you draw attention to me?" He explained his remarks this way: "Maybe my intent was poorly worded, but ... the point in making that comment was an attempt to try to understand a motive."{{fact}} <br/>+<br/>+Also in 1997, Stern's show aired for the first time in [[Canada]], appearing on CILQ in [[Toronto]] and CHOM in [[Montreal]]. Both stations cancelled Stern's show (CHOM sometime in 2000, CILQ in Toronto in November 2001) after frequent listener complaints to the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council and the CRTC; for most of the time that the stations did air Stern's program, they were required to monitor the show for offensive content through the use of broadcast delays. Stern has commented on-air that the Canadian government disapproved of his use of the [[ethnic slur]] "polack", and that was one of the reasons why his show was not broadcast in Canada until February 6, 2006, when "Howard 100" debuted on Sirius Canada.<br/>+<br/>+===2000s===<br/>+It was officially announced on March 5, 2001 that longtime show regular [[Jackie Martling|Jackie "The Jokeman" Martling]] had left the radio show after failed contract negotiations. Over the next several months, various comedians auditioned in the "Jackie Chair" for the job, with comedian [[Artie Lange]] landing the position.<br/>+<br/>+Stern was on the air in his New York City studio during the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] and stayed on the air with his cast/crew while many other broadcasters fled the city. Fittingly, he was in the middle of a rousing story about a rendezvous with [[Pamela Anderson]] when he first mentioned the the World Trade Center was on fire.  His coverage of the tragedy increased as the gravity of the situation became clear. His live reporting was the first news of the incident for many East Coast residents. Crew member K.C. Armstrong was the notable exception, as he left the city immediately and refused to return for several days. Stern and the rest of the cast/crew continued to broadcast over the subsequent days following the disaster. The show had a somewhat subdued tone, with many listeners calling in to share their own stories of survival or personal loss. As other comedy performers like David Letterman and [[Jon Stewart]] later returned to the air, many with emotionally-charged monologues, Stern was furious at the glowing response they received in the press, as he had been on the air the whole time without any positive reaction. This reinforced his long-held belief that there is a bias against him in the mainstream media.<br/>+<br/>+In 2002, Stern's production company Howard Stern Productions acquired the rights to the 1982 movie ''[[Porky's]]'' and the 1979 movie ''[[Rock 'n' Roll High School]]''. Stern was a producer of the TV series ''[[Son of the Beach]]'', which ran for 3 seasons.<br/>+<br/>+Despite the provocative content of Stern's show, or perhaps because of it, many listeners and critics consider Stern to be a talented on-air personality and formidable interviewer. (He informed listeners early in 2004 that the ABC television network was in talks with him to produce an interview special.) His popularity has given rise to a number of rival "shock jocks" who have attempted to outdo Stern in terms of offensiveness and rudeness, but these rivals have yet to challenge Stern's ratings.<br/>+<br/>+On [[February 25]], [[2004]], [[Clear Channel Communications]] "indefinitely suspended" him from six markets because of alleged indecency involving sexual and racist dialogue during his show. The show in question featured [[Rick Salomon]], whose claims to fame include a publicly released home video showing him having sex with hotel heiress and socialite [[Paris Hilton]]. During this broadcast Stern held what could be considered a sexually-provocative and racially insensitive interview with Salomon, asking him graphic questions about anal sex and making light of a caller's use of the word "[[nigger]]". Clear Channel president John Hogan said, "Clear Channel drew a line in the sand today with regard to protecting our listeners from indecent content, and Howard Stern's show blew right through it...it was vulgar, offensive and insulting, not just to women and [[African-Americans]] but to anyone with a sense of common decency." The move came only a day after Clear Channel fired Bubba the Love Sponge for similar reasons. This is considered to be part of a wide-ranging backlash against obscenity triggered by the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy]]. Because Clear Channel and some of its executives have donated over $200,000 to the Republican Party, Stern claims the company was trying to penalize him for his harsh criticisms of [[President George W. Bush]]. On his radio show Stern told his listeners, "There's a lot of people saying that the second that I started saying, 'I think we gotta get Bush out of the presidency,' that's when Clear Channel banged my ass outta here. Then I find out that Clear Channel is such a big contributor to President Bush, and in bed with the whole Bush administration, I'm going, 'Maybe that's why I was thrown off: because I don't like the way the country is leaning too much to the religious right.' And then, bam! Let's get rid of Stern. I used to think, 'Oh, I can't believe that.' But that's it! That's what's going on here! I know it! I know it!" <ref>[http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2004/03/04/stern/index.html The Passion of The Stern] Salon.com , March 4, 2004</ref><br/>+<br/>+Stern turned against Bush, as he did [[Bill Clinton]], because neither, as he has put it, got "the FCC off my back." Stern perceived Bush's religios beliefs as fanatical and has described [[George W. Bush]] as a "Jesus freak," a "maniac" and "an arrogant bastard". <ref>[http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2004/03/12/stern/index.html Howard Stern's Schwing Voters] Salon.com March 12, 2004</ref><br/>+<br/>+Stern endorsed [[John Kerry]] in the 2004 U.S. presidential campaign, and urged his listeners to vote for him, which at the time, was the latest in a long string of political endorsements Stern has made, having earlier supported former New York City mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]], among others. In an on-air stunt, Stern promised then-gubernatorial candidate [[Christine Todd Whitman]] of [[New Jersey]] that he would endorse her candidacy if she promised to name a rest stop on the [[New Jersey Turnpike]] after him if she were elected. She won and kept her promise, although one of her successors, Democrat [[Jim McGreevey]], later claimed impropriety by Whitman and revoked the "honor." <br/>+<br/>+On [[February 27]], [[2004]], long-time Stern show regular [[John Melendez]] left the show to become the on-air announcer for ''[[The Tonight Show]]''. Stern has consistently claimed the move was an attempt by [[Jay Leno]] to steal ideas from Howard's show. Many late night talk show bits are said to have been stolen from the Stern show, including Jay Leno's bit "Jaywalking".<br/>+<br/>+Throughout the Spring of 2004, Stern was a very vocal and staunch critic of [[Mel Gibson]] and his religious epic, ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]''. He called the film a "kook festival for a robotic freak audience" and even linked his radio suspension to the film, claiming that it was causing a "religious frenzy" and that anyone who goes to see the movie is "stupid and ignorant". At one point Stern said that "Mel Gibson makes [[Hitler]] look like [[Gandhi]]".<br/>+<br/>+On [[April 8]], [[2004]], Clear Channel Communications announced it would "permanently terminate" its relationship with the shock jock [3] after being fined $500,000 by the FCC. However, on July 19, Stern returned to four of the six markets Clear Channel booted him from, and added five new ones to the roster—this time on Infinity-owned stations. In late August, he returned to a fifth market, Miami, on an independent station. Here, as was often typical with Stern, his return was greeted with controversy as the Miami Dolphins threatened to revoke their broadcast deal with the station in question if the station did not fire him.<br/>+<br/>+On [[April 6]], [[2005]], Stern pleaded on-air for Infinity Broadcasting to let him out of his contract, citing the reason of possible prosecution, per U.S. House Judiciary Committee Chairman [[James Sensenbrenner Jr.]]'s recommendation. FMQB.com quoted Stern as saying, "They're (Viacom) holding me to the contract and I'm afraid to break the contract, because I don't want to ever do anything illegal or wrong. I'm very, very clear on that. I'm a pretty honest guy. I try to live by the laws, but it seems like I'm being set up." <ref>[http://www.fmqb.com/Article.asp?id=77069 Howard Stern Begs Viacom To Fire Him] FMQB</ref>It must also be added that within Stern's contract with Viacom/Infinity, if he were to have been fired or his show cancelled, his employer would have had to pay out a twenty million dollar fee as a result of this early termination to him and his production company. <br/>+<br/>+On [[June 22]], [[2005]], it was announced that production of the ''Howard Stern'' television show on [[E!]] would be ending. The last new episode was taped on [[July 1]] and aired on [[July 8]]. E! continued to rerun the show until [[December 31]], [[2005]].<br/>+<br/>+===The Move to Sirius Satellite Radio===<br/>+On [[October 6]], [[2004]], Stern announced on his show that he signed a five year, a $500 million deal with the satellite radio service Sirius. An additional $225 million one time stock bonus which he would recieve if the show attracted a certain amount of listeners in a given time, which it did.<br/>+<br/>+The $500 million contract and $225 million stock deal placed Stern at second richest celebrity of the year at $302 million dollars. Ahead of [[George Lucas]], [[Oprah Winfrey]], [[The Rolling Stones]] and even [[Tom Cruise]].[[http://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/53/Compen_Salary.html]] The deal, which took effect on January 1, 2006, would enable Stern to broadcast his show without, at present, the content restrictions imposed by the FCC. In addition, the deal would also enable Stern to program an additional Sirius channel. <br/>+<br/>+The move to satellite radio met much controversy, as Stern talked about his move to Sirius on his terrestrial show, including telling listeners how to purchase Sirius equipment and subscriptions. To promote his move, Stern held a rally in New York where he gave out coupons for free or discounted Sirius equipment. Stern's touting of his move to Sirius resulted in some radio stations censoring him every time he mentioned the words "Sirius" or "satellite radio". In one incident, Farid Suleman of Citadel Broadcasting went so far as to bill Stern $200,000 for the plugs he gave Sirius on his show. Stern's response was, "Keep sending me bills. Like I'm going to pay 'em," which he publicly stated on his show.<br/>+<br/>+On [[November 7]], [[2005]] Infinity Broadcasting suspended Stern from going live on air on [[November 8]] [[2005]], because Stern was promoting his move to Sirius radio too much.<br/>+<br/>+It was revealed in the [[December 12]], 2005 issue of ''[[New York Magazine]]'' that [[XM Satellite Radio]] had been prepared to offer Howard a $30 million dollar per-year contract in 2004, but its executives were slow to close the deal, giving Sirius the chance it needed. When asked why he picked [[Sirius Satellite Radio|Sirius]] over the competitor, XM, Howard replied that he "always liked the underdog. Every radio station I ever went to was a toilet bowl."{{fact}}  He has also stated that during very preliminary negotiations with XM, he found the management to be slow and unresponsive while Sirius was "nimble". Stern's budget with Sirius, including all operating costs, is $500 million for the 5 year contract.<br/>+<br/>+In addition, Sirius gave Stern two channels, "[[Howard 100]]" and "Howard 101."  Both of these channels launched in October 2005. Although Stern himself was not able to broadcast on Sirius until his Infinity contract expired, he had been producing content to fill the otherwise dead air. Shows have included a live, 24-hour broadcast of Wack Pack member "[[Wendy the Retard]]", another 24-hour broadcast of "[[The Wack Pack|High Pitch Eric]]", which featured the weighing of his excrement, and auditions of other Wack Packers for their own permanent shows. A legitimate news team of award-winning journalists was put together to launch "[[Howard 100 News]]," a nightly broadcast of "all things Howard." Stern also announced fellow shock jock [[Bubba the Love Sponge]] would have his own nightly talk show starting in January 2006 on one of his channels. Since the move to Sirius, Stern has created "The Friday Show", which is an extended version of "The Wrapup Show", which airs everyday after his Morning Radio Show. "The Friday Show", hosted by [[Jon Hein]] ,[[Gary Dell'Abate]] and [[Ralph Cirella]], airs live on those Fridays when Howard's show is not on the air.<br/>+<br/>+A third channel was announced in 2004 but later dropped when Stern, Sirius, and Infinity, aka CBS Radio, failed to secure a deal which would have allowed old shows from Stern's terrestrial radio days at Infinity to be rebroadcast on Sirius. Infinity wanted Stern and Sirius to pay approximately $50 million for the rights of the old material, but Stern and Sirius felt the price was too high. If the deal had taken place, the third channel would have aired classic Stern clips and shows. The settlement of the CBS lawsuit ([[Howard Stern#CBS Lawsuit|see below]]) later gave Stern and Sirius access to these shows.  Whether or not this will resurrect the prospects of a third channel remains to be seen. <br/>+<br/>+Due to his former contract with [[Infinity Broadcasting]], now [[CBS Radio]], neither Stern nor anyone under contract from his show could be heard on Sirius before January 1, 2006. Stern called in to a New Years Eve broadcast on [[Howard 100]] a few minutes past midnight on January 1st, and spoke to hosts from [[Howard 100 News]] for over an hour.  There had been much speculation as to when exactly Stern would first be heard on [[Sirius]]. On [[January 1]], [[2006]], Stern did a commercial free segment on his two stations [[Howard 100]] and [[Howard 101]] playing clips from his days as a child, to working at [[WTBU]] ([[Boston University]] [[Campus radio|college radio]]), [[WCCC]], [[WWWW|W4]], [[WWDC (FM)|WWDC]], [[WFAN|WNBC]], and [[WFNY-FM|WXRK]]. <br/>+<br/>+On [[January 3]] and [[January 5]], 2006, Stern and other members of his show conducted live test broadcasts, 70-minute and 130-minute respectively, in which he tested, live and on-air, various components of his new studio including audio levels, call-in functions, and studio ease-of-use. Various callers congratulated Stern on his new venture, although he reiterated that the broadcast was nothing more than a test designed to give users a sneak peek, and not an actual show. He made a point to reaffirm the first show, technically clean but completely uncensored, would take place on [[January 9]], [[2006]].<br/>+<br/>+===Goodbye to Terrestrial Radio===<br/>+[[Image:H100logofist.jpg|left|frame|'''Howard 100 Logo''']]<br/>+Howard's last show on conventional AM/FM "terrestrial" radio was on [[December 16]], [[2005]]. The show was on the streets of New York below [[WFNY|K-Rock]], simulcast live accompanied by video on the Internet through [[Yahoo!]], with several thousand fans in attendance at the scene. The studio segment of the show ended with Stern and company each saying a final farewell, then leaving the studio for the street stage, with Stern being the last to leave. Many members of the show's "Wack Pack" gave speeches and [[Staind]] performed. Speeches were given by each member of the show: Gary, Artie, Fred, Robin, and finally Howard, who frequently referred to himself and his fans as "the last of a dying breed." During his speech, Stern thanked the NYPD and dedicated the show to Sgt. Keith Manning, a friend of the show who at the time was serving in Iraq. Stern was then bused to the [[Hard Rock Cafe]] in [[Times Square]], where [[Martha Stewart]] (who also has her own Sirius talk channel) was on hand to induct Howard Stern into the Sirius family. Much of the show took place at the Hard Rock Cafe in New York where [[Sheryl Crow]] performed and mentioned on stage the debt America and musicians should pay towards Stern.<br/>+<br/>+True to the last broadcast, much of Stern's final statements were bleeped/edited-out on the radio and even on the Yahoo internet broadcast. These statements largely pertained to Stern's animosity towards Clear Channel and the future at Sirius. As a response to Stern leaving [[FM radio]], many of the radio stations under ownership of [[CBS Radio]], including K-Rock in New York, changed their format from music to a [[hot talk]] format. Select stations were rebranded "[[Free FM]]". Stern's flagship station changed its name from 92.3 K-Rock to [[WFNY-FM|92.3 Free FM]]. Stern himself was a harsh critic of the "Free FM" format in his last days on terrestrial radio, arguing that the name was a joke due to continued FCC and industry censorship.<br/>+<br/>+==The Sirius Show==<br/>+[[Image:sternjabber.jpeg|thumb|left|Stern in his element: behind a microphone.]]<br/>+''The Howard Stern Show'' debuted on Sirius, on [[January 9]], [[2006]]. The "Howard 100 Heartbeat" broke away to [[Also sprach Zarathustra (Strauss)|Also Sprach Zarathustra]] tunefully performed with flatulence. Howard's theme music, "Great American Nightmare," played a few bars before [[George Takei]] introduced himself as the show's new announcer. Callers were soon invited to call into the show using their new toll-free line, 1-888-9-ASSHOLE. <br/>+<br/>+During the show, Stern revealed that there were 180,000 Sirius receivers activated the day before his inaugural broadcast. He also revealed that he was not married, squashing rumors which appeared (and he happily fed) during his hiatus. One of his first radio acts on Sirius included the uncensored [[Pat O'Brien (television)|Pat O'Brien]] sex tapes and his uncensored version of parody songs using the sex tape.<br/>+<br/>+To dispel the notion that the move to Sirius would unleash a wave of cursing and vulgar language, Stern placed a gag order on himself and other members of his staff.  Sal the Stockbroker and Ronnie the Limo Driver were especially singled out for excessive cursing and have since been forbidden to curse.  Although Stern has the occasional guest slip up, such as when [[Alexis Stewart]] recalled a friend describing her as "cunty," he has been conscious of not overdoing it.  However, he has given Artie Lange carte blanche to use whatever language he wants, stating that "when Artie curses, it's funny."<br/>+<br/>+In addition to his regular morning show, which can be heard on [[Howard 100]] at 5:55a – 11:00a and 12:00n – 5:55a, several "spin-off" shows have emerged, such as ''The Wrap Up Show (aka "The show about the show about the show"), The Super Fan Rountable'', and ''The Intern Show'', all dedicated to discussion of the Stern Show from the points of view of Howard's producer, fans and interns, respectively. <br/>+<br/>+As of [[June 19]], [[2006]] (and possibly late in the show [[June 16]]), [[Howard 100]] and [[Howard 101]] are now streaming online from Sirius as a [[beta test]].<br/>+<br/>+Initially, [[Sirius Canada]] chose not to carry Stern because of the possibility of a future issue with the [[CRTC]]. [http://www.saidmaterial.com Josef Radomski], a Canadian writer, announced on the [[January 11]], [[2006]] show that he has started an [http://www.petitiononline.com/sterncan/petition.html online petition] to bring Stern to [[Sirius Canada]]. On [[February 1]], [[2006]], Sirius Canada announced that they would start airing Howard 100, starting February 6. <ref>[http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060201/sirius_canada_060201/20060201?hub=TopStories]</ref> His first day on Sirius Canada, a caller claiming to be [[Stephen Harper]], the Prime Minister designate who was sworn in as [[Prime Minister]] that same day, welcomed Stern back to the Canadian airwaves.<br/>+<br/>+===Howard 101===<br/>+Along with his Howard 100 on Sirius, which carries the live morning feed of Stern's show, the Howard 100 News hourly updates, and show replays all day, Stern is also in charge of Howard 101.  <br/>+<br/>+Howard 101 carries the West Coast feed of Stern's morning show, along with Bubba the Love Sponge in the afternoon and Scott Ferrall in the evening.  In addition, the 7est hour is devoted to weekly original content, such as ''The Intern Show, The Superfan Roundtable, Miserable Men, "Hello, Earth"'' with [[Riley Martin]], and monthly ''Basic Training'', a show dedicated to military issues hosted by Brent of Bubba's Show.<br/>+<br/>+Stern has promised to provide much more original content to his channels.  As of April 2006, [[Sam Simon]], co-creator of and writer on such hit network comedies as ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''[[Cheers]]'',  is writing a weekly radio show for Stern's channels, a satirical take-off on ABC's hit ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'', in which the show follows the daily lives of the cast members significant others.  As of June 16 2006, the Howard Stern Show is available online at Sirius.com with a valid user name/password<br/>+<br/>+===Terrestrial Radio Return Controversy===<br/>+During the month of May, 2006 Stern said that he had received offers from three major terrestrial radio companies to return. While the truthfulness of this claim was never verified by any radio company (detractors said that Stern's claim was merely a retort to CBS's signing of a unique joint venture with rival 'shock jocks' [[Opie and Anthony]] on XM satellite radio, who filled Howard's old time slot after David Lee Roth, Stern's Replacement, was fired), the issue was almost immediately made moot.  Stern said, while he wouldn’t return, “It would be cool to go back and kick their [CBS] asses.”<br/>+<br/>+Media organizations picked the story up announcing that he was thinking of returning to terrestrial radio. To clear up the rumors Stern called up Associated Press on [[May 10]], [[2006]].  While talking to Associated Press Stern said, "The story is I wouldn't do it [terrestrial radio] for any reason."{{fact}} <br/>+<br/>+===The Revelations===<br/>+'''Staff Revelation'''<br/>+<br/>+On [[January 16]], [[2006]] Stern began his [[The Howard Stern Show Revelations Game|Revelation Show]] where staff members of the show revealed dark secrets about themselves. <br/>+<br/>+Howard announced the first revelation of ''I Cheated on My Wife and She Caught Me.'' He asked the owner of that revelation to come in and [[Scott Salem|Scott the Engineer]] came in. Scott explained that it happened with his current wife about 12 years ago. Scott said that the girl, who he cheated with, kept calling and calling him. Scott, eventually, met up with her on one of his show road trips and had sex with her. The girl, angry that Scott did not leave his wife for her, sent his wife a tape of one of her phone conversations with Scott.<br/>+<br/>+Howard admitted to having plastic surgery on his nose and chin a few days after the filming of ''[[Private Parts]] (1997)''. Artie said that it was obvious and it looked very good. Robin criticized Howard saying “We already knew that. Big deal.” Howard said he kept it private for so long because he thought plastic surgery was “very gay.”<br/>+<br/>+The crew's revelations are as follows<ref>[http://www.marksfriggin.com/news06/1-16.htm#mon January 16, 2006 Show Rundown] Mark's Friggin</ref>:<br/>+* '''Howard:''' "I've had [[cosmetic surgery]]."<br/>+* '''[[Robin Quivers|Robin]]:''' "I have pleasured myself with meat and vegetables."<br/>+* '''[[Fred Norris]]:''' "I have a half sister I have never met and don't want to."<br/>+* '''[[Gary Dell'Abate]]:''' "My buddy and I once ordered massage girls but they ripped us off and left us staring at each other in our underwear."*<br/>+* '''[[Artie Lange]]:''' "A guy once [[ejaculation|blew his load]] on my chest."<br/>+* '''[[Scott Salem]]:''' "I cheated on my wife and she caught me."*<br/>+* '''[[Benjy Bronk]]:''' "I once had my stomach pumped for alcohol poisoning and when I woke up, an acquaintance of the same sex was fondling me."<br/>+* '''[[Sal the Stockbroker]]:''' "I once hid in a bathroom closet and pleasured myself as my family members went to the bathroom."<br/>+* '''[[Richard Christy]]:''' "In the last year I got a girl pregnant and had to pay for her abortion."<br/>+* '''Jason Kaplan:''' "I think I'm addicted to porn, I jerk off twice a day and prefer to masturbate, rather than having real sex."<br/>+* '''[[JD Harmeyer]]:''' "I have spent well over $10,000 on internet porn."<br/>+<br/>+NOTE: An asterisk indicates the cast member's original revelation was retracted and replaced with the one announced on the air.<br/>+<br/>+==The Howard Stern Film Festival==<br/>+[[Image:HTV_OnDemand_HSFilmFest_06.jpg|thumb|left|Howard Stern Film Festival]]<br/>+On April 28, 2006 the first Annual Howard Stern Film Festival debuted at The Hudson Theatre in New York City. The film festival took entries from fans and featured a grand prize of $35,000 in cash and prizes. Stern said of the festival, "People want access. The [[Tribeca Film Festival]] is too commercial. This is the one where the next great comedy directors will be discovered. This is good for New York, and it's good for the listeners. They get to come down here, participate, make creative films, and all the films are about me. What better topic is there?"<br/>+<br/>+The winner of the festival was [[Scott Masterson]] whose film "Radio Play" was a sentimental tribute to Stern that wondered what it would be like if Stern, Quivers, and Norris met over [[amateur radio]] as children.<ref> [http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1529773/04282006/story.jhtml Winner Of Howard Stern Film Festival Is A Shocker]MTV News</ref><br/>+<br/>+<br/>+<br/>+<br/>+==Notable Incidents==<br/>+<br/>+===CBS Lawsuit===<br/>+On [[February 28]], [[2006]], [[CBS Radio]] announced it had filed a lawsuit against Stern, Stern's agent Don Buchwald and [[Sirius Satellite Radio]], saying Stern used CBS's airwaves to unfairly promote the satellite service and enrich himself. The lawsuit also claims that Stern "repeatedly and willfully" breached his contract with CBS, "misappropriated millions of dollars worth of … airtime" for his own benefit, and "fraudulently concealed" his performance-related interests in Sirius stock. The suit, filed in New York state court, seeks compensatory and punitive damages. Not to be outdone, Stern earlier in the day (and prior to CBS's announcement) held a press conference at which, among other things, Stern said CBS added to the media attention and it, booking him for appearances on its news magazine show "60 Minutes" and "Late Show with David Letterman." "I made them millions of dollars. If I was hurting them why did they keep me on the air for 14 months?" Stern said. "How can you have it both ways?"{{fact}} <br/>+<br/>+[[Leslie Moonves]] himself appeared on one of Stern's final shows to compliment him on his move to Sirius and thank him for the record advertising revenue the network sold. Moonves even added that he bought Sirius stock.  This revelation was brought up to the public by Howard himself numerous times.  Stern himself even brought up the fact that the network had the option to "push the button" on his program, taking him off the air, if they didn't agree with what he was saying and putting out before the public.<br/>+<br/>+On May 11, 2006 CBS claimed they were near settling the lawsuit with Stern.

The claim was that Howard had gagged the show from mentioning himself or his family, and was instituted by [[Mel Karmazin]].

Robin reads the news and they discuss or make fun of it; Robin either joins in the discussion or attempts to plod along with the news.<br/>+*The Gossip Game - with [[Mike Walker]] from the [[National Enquirer]]; four absurd celebrity stories, staff (and sometimes callers) would guess on the single fake story.<br/>+*Wheel of Sex - like [[Wheel of Fortune]], except the wheel selects a sexual act for a guest to perform.<br/>+*The Stupid Bowl - contestants perform embarrassing or disgusting acts for prizes.<br/>+*The Homeless Game - resurrected on May 26, 2006 - many variants, often played with call-in guests. The contestant would bet on whether or not a homeless person, stripper, or mentally retarded person would be able to answer common knowledge questions. A stripper was once asked what a pickle was made from - to which she responded that "a pickle is marinated from a grape".<br/>+*Stump The Booey - song recognition contest against Gary; requires either a female contestant or a male contestant who brings a female agreeing to strip naked in the event of a loss. On the satellite show, the female must ride the Sybian should she/her couterpart lose. Gary usually wins. Music is primarily from the 1980s, with a large concentration of one hit wonders.<br/>+*Stump The Perv - guests compete against [[Richard Christy]] in this pornographic movies trivia contest, Richard usually wins<br/>+*Win Fred's Money - timed trivia contest; losing to Fred involves nudity, Fred usually wins.<br/>+*Who Wants to be a Turkish Millionaire? - trivia contest similar to [[Who Wants To Be A Millionaire]]; contestants are required to answer common knowledge questions for a million [[Turkish Lira]]. Value of the prize depends on current exchange rates but is somewhat less than $1 in United States currency.<br/>+*Evil David Letterman - a [[David Letterman]] voice impersonator who occasionally sits in the studio and makes off-color comments and [[non sequitur (absurdism)|non sequiturs]] during the show.<br/>+*Ride The [[Sybian]] - new with the Sirius show; Sybian riders include [[Jenna Jameson]], [[Carmen Electra]], Savana Samson, Buck Angel (a pre-op female-to-male transsexual), Blue Iris (a 65 year old porn star), and Rappin' Grannie (an 84 year old grandmother who received her first orgasm ever on the Sybian).<br/>+*Mexican Delivery Guy Game - played with [[Savanna Samson]] where upon receiving the food, a proposition of either a great tip or sexual favors would be given<br/>+*[[Crank call]]s - calling [[public access]] television shows, or calling random recipients who are frequently driven to yelling at cut-together recordings of peoples' voices. Stern has quipped on the air that he has a full-time staff (Sal and Richard) dedicated to telephone harassment.<br/>+*The Top Five - Howard and crowd discuss the top five songs. They usually play bits of parody songs between real songs, then make fun of the real songs.<br/>+<br/>+===Discontinued=== <br/>+*Guess Who's The Jew - There are several variations of this game.  One includes having to guess from a list of several celebrities which one is a Jew.  Another includes bringing several people into the studio and guessing which one is a Jew, with contestants typically judging based on appearance, and answers to questions both the contestant and on-air personalities ask.<br/>+*Lesbian Dial-a-Date - This game involves finding a date for a woman looking for a homosexual encounter by having other women call in and be evaluated.<br/>+*[[The Wack Pack#Daniel Carver|Daniel Carver]]'s KKK Movie Review - show staffers would assign several films; Carver would watch them and rate them on a scale of burning crosses.<br/>+*The F-Emmies - This is an on-air awards ceremony often spread over several weeks, commemorating the best Stern bits of the year.<br/>+*The Tickle Chair - female guests are strapped to a chair and tickled, though sessions often also include groping.<br/>+*God With The Weather - During this bit, which mostly aired on DC101 during the early 1980s, "[[God]]" would call in and provide weather forecasts and discusss other issues. Stern would pre-tape God's comments and play them back, using his thumb to slow the playback on a [[reel-to-reel]] (as described by Gary on The Friday Show). The genesis was probably Stern's indignance at having to read weather forecasts. The broadcast often included statements that were extremely shocking and blasphemous for the early 1980s. This bit briefly appeared in [[Private Parts]]. Old forecasts are frequently played on The Friday Show.<br/>+*Irene With The Weather - Irene the Leather-Weather Lady was a W4 Detroit fixture as a [[dominatrix]] who would insult Stern and his show while reading weather forecasts. As with God With The Weather, this was probably a form of protest at Stern having to include weather forecasts in his show.<br/>+<br/>+==Common Show Sayings and Soundbites==<br/>+Only current Soundbites and Sayings listed.<br/>+*"Hello, hello" (From a horrendous videotape Gary filmed of himself in an attempt to win back an old flame)<br/>+*"[[Hey Now!]]" (Stern's greeting, based on Hank from ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]'')<br/>+*"Bababooey" (Used as everything from a [[nickname]] for producer [[Gary Dell'Abate]] to a drop-in Stern reference during phony telephone calls)<br/>+*"Oh my!"

The ethnicities within the community span the length and breadth of Europe, although Eurasian migrants to Singapore in the 19th century came largely from colonies already in Asia, such as old Malaya, Goa, Chittagong, the Dutch Indies, and the French Indo-China.<br/>-<br/>-Currently, the community boasts family names which come from [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] (Conceicao, De Almeida, De Souza, Oliveiro, Pereira, Monteiro, De Payva, Pestana, Gomes, Nunes, Theseira, etc), [[Dutch people|Dutch]] (Ess, Marbeck, Van Culyenberg, Reutens, Vanderstraaten), [[Armenian people|Armenian]] (Galistan), [[French people|French]] (Longue, Poulier), [[Danish people|Danish]] (Lange, Olsen), [[German people|German]] (Oehlers), [[Swedish people|Swedish]] (Holmberg) and [[British]] (Shepherdson, Capel, Caines) nationalities.<br/>-<br/>-==The Portuguese==<br/>-The first Europeans to land in Asia were the Portuguese, followed by the Spanish. The Portuguese explorers also ferried the first Jesuit Priests to Asia. Their descendants, who are of mixed Portuguese and Malay/Chinese/Indian descent, are collectively known as [[Kristang people|Papia Kristang]].<br/>-<br/>-==The Dutch==<br/>-In 1602, a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] trading company called the VOC (abbreviated from ''Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie'', meaning United East India Company) was created to conduct trade in the area east of the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and west of the [[Straits of Magellan]]. In establishing their numerous trade stations spanning across Asia, the Dutch created independent settler societies in each of their [[colony|colonies]], where [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] (now [[Jakarta]]) became the administrative centre and rendezvous point for the company's Asian shipping traffic.<br/>-<br/>-Between 1602 and 1795, the VOC fitted out some 4,700 ships which carried almost a million Europeans to the [[Far East]]. Almost 70 percent of the one million of the passengers never actually returned to Europe, making Asia their new home. These early seafarers were not only made up of Dutch, but also included [[Germany|Germans]], [[Huguenot|French Huguenots]], [[Italy|Italians]], [[British Empire|British]], [[Scandinavia]]ns and other Europeans who were employed by the VOC. In time, many were [[Cultural assimilation|assimilated]] into Dutch colonies situated throughout Asia (though primarily in modern [[Indonesia]]) where they were stationed and became part of the respective communities.<br/>-<br/>-[[Intermarriage]]s between VOC employees and locals were encouraged, which lead to the creation of communities of Dutch descendants. Today, there are only four surviving coherent and large communities who are descended from those early intermarriages by VOC employees. They are the [[Coloureds]] from [[South Africa]], Dutch [[Burghers]] from [[Ceylon]] (modern [[Sri Lanka]]), Dutch Indos from [[Indonesia]], some [[Anglo-Burmese]] and Dutch Eurasians from [[Malacca, Malaysia]].<br/>-<br/>-Dutch descendants in Malaysia and Singapore are primarily made up of Dutch Eurasians originating from Malacca, Ceylon Dutch Burghers originating from Sri Lanka as well as early Dutch settlers originating from Indonesia and India.<br/>-<br/>-==The Armenians==<br/>-<br/>-Migrants from [[Armenia]] arrived in Asia as [[refugee]]s, fleeing [[persecution]] by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in their occupied homeland.<br/>-<br/>-==The Eurasian Community at large==<br/>-Overwhelmingly [[Christianity|Christian]], most being [[Catholic]]s of Portuguese descent, celebrating Christian feast days such as [[Christmas]], [[Easter]] and [[Corpus Christi]]. <br/>-<br/>-[[English language|English]] is spoken as a first language, whilst amongst the elder generation the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] [[Portuguese Creole|creole]] known as Papia Cristao or Kristang [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crist%C3%A3o] is still spoken by a handful of people. <br/>-<br/>-Unique to their culinary traditions are [[Devil's curry]], Feng, Vin D'arlo, Mulligatani, Shepherd's pie & [[wikibooks:Cookbook: Eurasian Smore|Eurasian Smore]].<br/>-<br/>-== Famous Eurasian Singaporeans ==<br/>-<br/>-* [[Eunice Olsen]], Nominated Member of Parliament (NMP) <br/>-* Flying Dutchman aka [[Mark Van Cuylenberg]], [[Radio personality]]<br/>-* [[Jeremy Monteiro]], [[Jazz Musician]], [[Radio personality ]]<br/>-* [[Benjamin Sheares]], former [[President of Singapore]]<br/>-* [[Joe Conceicao]], retired [[Member of Parliament of Singaproe|Member of Parliament]] for [[Katong]] and Ambassador to [[Indonesia]]<br/>-* [[E.W Barker]], former [[People's Action Party]] [[Cabinet of Singapore|cabinet minister]]<br/>-* [[Cheryl Cordeiro]], Miss Singapore Universe 1999<br/>-* [[Arthur Jen Fong]], Member of Parliament <br/>-* [[Pearl Forss]], [[news reporter]]<br/>-* [[Shanice Elizabeth Nathan]], [[child actress]], [[singer]], [[dancer]] and [[TV host]]<br/>-* [[Camie De Souza]], news reporter<br/>-* [[Kim Wakerman]], [[child actress]]<br/>-* [[Gary Fernandez]], [[local stage actor]]<br/>-* [[Andre Frois]], local [[nightclub]] personality<br/>-* [[Kenneth Thexeira]], [[local independent comedian/actor]]<br/>-* [[Cheryl Fox]], news anchor<br/>-* [[Jean Danker]], Radio personality<br/>-* [[Denise Keller]], Model and [[MTV]] Asia host<br/>-* [[Andrea De Cruz]], [[actress]]<br/>-* [[Vernetta Lopez]], [[actress]], radio personality<br/>-* [[Sarah Tan]], model and [[Channel V]] International VJ<br/>-* [[Paul Twohill]], Singapore Idol 2006 Finalist<br/>-* [[Joakim Gomez]], Singapore Idol 2006 Finalist.<br/>-<br/>-==External links==<br/>-<br/>-*[http://www.eurasians.org The Eurasian Association of Singapore]<br/>-*[http://www.dutchmalaysia.net/ Malaysian Dutch Descendants Project]<br/>-<br/>-[[Category:Eurasians|*]]<br/>-[[Category:Demographics of Singapore]]<br/>+{{korean}}<br/>+{{WPCHINA}}<br/>+{{WPMILHIST<br/>+|class=B<br/>+|importance=Top<br/>+|Australian-task-force=yes<br/>+|British-task-force=yes<br/>+|Canadian-task-force=yes<br/>+|French-task-force=yes<br/>+|Chinese-task-force=yes<br/>+|US-task-force=yes<br/>+}}<br/>+{{talkheader}}<br/>+<br/>+<br/>+I don't understand how the Inchon landings can be absent. The article jumps from the Pusan Perimeter (which deserves more than a few paragraphs on its own) to Chinese intervention. Is this an intentional slight to MacArthur? No facts on the NKA reeling back to cover their flanks and supply links is an interesting way to show distaste for Mac Arthur and his brilliant move to save the remnants of South Korea. <br/>+<br/>+As for the occasionally recurring story about bio warfare in NK, even the Sovs stopped using that dead horse after it became an embarrassment. Even the Sov archives show this to be without merit, so although I agree with including it in the article, there should be statement that none of the allegations have been proven and instead most of them have been disproven.

Also there's this thing about the South Koreans capturing a town on 26 June north of the 38th parallel and initial reports about the South Koreans doing the attacking... Maybe someone else knows a bit more on this... unfortunately I haven't got my books at hand... Finally, shouldn't it be mentioned that Syngman Rhee called for a forceful unification with the north?

He argued that the war was as much South Korea's fault as the North's.  Then the Soviet archives opened and we now know that it was pretty much an unprovoked attack by the North. But yes, this theory should be mentioned, even if it has mostly been discredited. - [[User:SimonP|SimonP]] 19:42, Dec 16, 2003 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+Whatever the Soviet archives might have contained in terms of intentions and plans of North Korea, the Soviets and China, that doesn't change the record of the US and South Korean actions before the official date of June 25, 1950, using Japanese troops and collaborators to create a government over popular leaders, fighting insurgents who had resisted the Japanese and fighting N. Korean troops in many skirmishes across the border. (Invading S. Korea to depose Syngman Rhee probably would have been popular in the US if we'd had real information about his rule.)

Attacking a hospital, ambulance, killing prisoners, etc. are prohibited under conventions like [[GCIV]] and incendiaries were outlawed in 1980 (after the Korean war ended, obviously) but nothing specifically disallowing attacks on civilians. Please correct me if I am wrong. I think agreements to ban such things were proposed but never agreed upon?

I can't find anything in the Geneva conventions or the Hague convention. I heard from someone that it was proposed in a later Hague convention but was not adopted by anyone. However I didn't really take the time to read all the conventions all the way through so it's possible that I missed something. I certainly agree it's distasteful to target civilians but I point out that for example, during World War 2, this was practiced by all major parties - Germany, Japan, USA and UK - and they all admitted to it. In fact, the main reason restraint was exercised earlier in the war was for fear of prompting reprisals, which was quickly discarded when civilian bombing began. Dresden, Tokyo, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, etc. were exception only for the number of deaths in such a short period. Many more total civilians were killed by bombing in smaller raids throughout the way. Unfortunately, at the time, this was seen as the only means to end the war that was within the power of the various strategic air forces.<br/>+<br/>+Anyway, I digress. I agree that it's fine to mention this sort of thing in an NPOV way. I was just wondering if calling it a crime was in fact POV, as it is my understanding that this is not technically the case, which would make it so. Even if it is technically a crime, it's pretty POV to mention particular incidents when I'm sure all parties to the war engaged in questionable actions at one time or another. [[User:Nvinen|Nvinen]] 09:03, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:Direct targeting of civlians was prohibited (1897 or 1907), but the convention language was contradictary, so it could be interpreted as to be allowed in some circumstances. A weapons factory could have been said to qualify as a military target; civilian casualties ("collateral damage") attacking it were acceptable, even by strict interpretation.

Similar events occurred after the capture of Pyongyang.  Following the entry of China into the war, the Department of State estimates that 50,000-90,000 men from Pyongyang died of starvation, disease, exposure and bruality when the ROK conscripted them with the intention to use them as slave soldiers.<br/>+<br/>+Even disregarding US atrocities, which were mostly from aerial bombardment rather than executions and are relatively well summed-up at the end of the "Air War" section, massacres by the ROK were similar in number and magnitude to those by the DPRK and Chinese.  This should not be surprising considering that the ROK leadership was made up of mainly those people who had collaborated with the Japanese in their occupation and brutalisation of East Asia.<br/>+<br/>+Considering this, the "Atrocities and War Crimes" section reads close to slanderous McCarthyism, which, given that we do, in fact, have the benefit of hindsight, is clearly inappropriate.<br/>+<br/>+I have taken the liberty to remove the Taejon comment, but will leave the management of the remainder of the obvious oversights to others more experienced than I.<br/>+<br/>+I think most of us can agree that the War Crimes section is a bit of a shambles, as, indeed, is much of the commentary when one considers the magnitude of the conflict.

F-86s designated by the USAF as lost to unk reasons were also possible shoot-downs where the pilot was not recovered. The truth of the matter for both sides obviously lies somewhere inbetween the stated claims, but to accept the "discovery" of "recently unclassified" Soviet documents as the authoritative source is beyond absurd. The fact is that Soviet sources agree that veteran Soviet pilots engaged UN aircraft in cycles, and after March 1952 hardly at all.

I can find no source that asserts the F-86 matching the MiG-15 in these characteristics.<br/>+<br/>+The F-86's main advantages were the already mentioned radar gunsight, roll rate, far superior transsonic maneuverability due primarily to the use of elevons, and being much less prone to departures near the edge of the envelope.

In any case, the word ''strength'' implies the ability to wage war as indicated by the number of troops available at any one time. The total contribution does not provide an accurate picture of the ability to wage war. Also, I know for a fact that all of the other low numbers in the table are strengths at one time. This is the usual way of representing troop strengths in war literature (i.e., just listing the strength at one time). The method you suggest actually striked me as more bizarre. Adding ranges at all was my idea to compromise with anonymous editors just to make them happy. We have very few total contributions listed in the table, so to make it consistent, I would have preferred just keep the static numbers--rather than the totals. --[[User:Primetime|Primetime]] 06:08, 20 January 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::::Interesting perspective. First off, I totally agree that <b>overemphasizing</b> would absolutely denigrate EVERYONE who participated. But I clearly stated, "<b><i>If other countries have been similiarly slighted, then I feel that they too deserve to have their full contribution tallied and shown</i></b>". Obviously I meant that the <i><u>full</u></i> contribution of <b>EVERY</b> country should be included on the list. Secondly, when viewing a conflict in a historic perspective, I believe that the <i>entirety</i> of <i>every</i> country's contribution should be detailed. Indicating a particular country's troop strength seems a very peculiar method to choose because it is <i>severely</i> lacking in context. For example: <ul><li>Imagine a 10 year long conflict with an overall "allied" casualty rate of 10%:<li>Country "A" initially rushes in and provides 10,000 combat troops.<li>Country "B" can't afford to send so many troops, but wants to help and sends 5000 troops.<li>Two years later, country "A"'s populace has become discontent and mandates that country's departure from the conflict. They pack up their wagons and go home.<li>Meanwhile, Country "B" believes strongly in the cause and keeps its 5000 troops on station for the entire fight.<li>At the end, Country "A" has contributed 12,000 troops and Country "B" has sent 10,000, however Country "B" has suffered overall casualties of 50% (500x10 years=5000) but Country "A" had less than 17% (1000x2=2000)</ul>According to your chosen method, you would detail both country's overall contribution to the conflict as follows: "Country A: 10,000", "Country B: 5000". I have to ask, is that <i>really</i> an accurate portrayal of each country's contribution? Additionally, both methods ignore relativity in the capacity of each country to wage the conflict. For example, Canada is approximately 1/10th of the size of the United States. If the US contributes 10000 troops, Canada would have a relatively equal contribution if it sent only 1000. But on these lists, that wouldn't be apparent either. Nevertheless, I hope that my example demonstrates clearly how your method dramatically misrepresents the <u>overall</u> contribution to the effort of each country. For a real-world example, (and I apologise because I don't have numbers to fill in): In World War I, Great Britain (and it's Dominions), France and Germany fought for four brutal years, from 1914 through 1918. Russia, which fought from the outset departed slightly early in 1918 due to the Russian Revolution and the United States came in late (early in 1917). However, if you were to make a similiar list using <i>only</i> each country's one-time troop strength, the table would make it seem as though every country had an approximately equal contribution. Historically speaking, such a table would be a very misleading way to relate a view of that conflict. BTW: The World War I Wikipedia entry doesn't even list troop strengths at all, only overall casualties, an interesting choice for such a globally devastating event.<br/>+<br/>+:::::You know what, after all that, I realise that we're talking about apples and oranges. Your list (as you state) is of <b>Troop Strength</b>, whereas my information is of overall contribution. In realising this, I understand why, in relation to what it is that you're showing, you say the lower number is appropriate; and I agree that for the purpose of strictly detailing raw troop strength, you are correct. That having been said, however, I have to say that my original argument should have been that detailing this information, in this way, doesn't really tell people anything! At least, nothing that adds value to the overall purpose of the article. Raw troop strength, even assuming it's maximal, is essentially irrelevant -- it doesn't say anything about the war itself, or even (since it is <i>entirely</i> without context) anything about the countries themselves. As my example in the prior paragraph indicates, simply stating the largest number of troops contributed by a country at some point during the war doesn't tell you anything about that country's overall contribution to the effort. So, given these deficiencies, I don't understand what value this chart (in this form) adds to this article? Personally, I think that <i>overall troop contributions</i> would have a greater value for demonstrating a particular country's commitment, but I'm curious to hear the rationale behind using this method? [[User:216.240.7.149|216.240.7.149]] 02:32, 21 January 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+I agree with all of your points except one in that I think that both the total as well as the static number would be valuable. The number of troops present at one time helps give a picture of the threater as well as the politics of the situation. I agree though, that the total-contribution figure helps to give the long-term impact of each country as well as a better picture of the impact on the home front. (Although I always go straight for the static numbers myself.) So, I think that we should keep the static numbers (as I still think they're the most important for understanding ''the war front'' rather than the home one) but am also open to expanding on the totals. However, that raises the question of how to do that exactly. I can think of three ways we could:<br/>+<br/>+<ol><li>Add the totals in the table in parentheses like this: [[Canada]] 6,146 (total 26,791*)<br/>+:*The downside to this approach would be that the table might look cluttered and thus be harder to understand.<br/>+<li>Expand the table vertically or add another table somewhere else in the article<br/>+:*The downside to this would be that the article is already somewhat crowded with images and this raises the question whether you have the total figures on hand.<br/>+<li>Create another page for the total figures and add a link to it in the current table, like ''for total contributions see ---''.<br/>+:*The downside to this would be that total contributions might be less visible and also again whether you have the totals handy.</ol><br/>+<br/>+In sum, I see no reason to ''delete'' anything in something as broad in scope as an encyclopedia, but I'm very open to adding anything you have. --[[User:Primetime|Primetime]] 03:19, 21 January 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br><br><center><br/>+<table border='0' bordercolor='#000000' width='700'><br/>+<tr><td colspan='3' bgcolor='#ffff99' align='center'><b>Combatant Troop Contributions</b></td><br/>+<td rowspan='29' valign='top' bgcolor='#fcfcff'><div align='justify'><br><br/>+Actually, I think that putting overall troop-contribution totals <i>together</i> with the front-line troop strengths helps in a lot of ways.

As for the method of presenting all of this information, I wonder if we might try an altogether different layout.

Most of these countries have since excised these provisions as they are increasingly seen as antidemocratic.  The [[Constitution of Paraguay]] still has such a provision, but former presidents are permitted only to speak and not vote.  Probably the most familiar case is that of Chilean dictator [[Augusto Pinochet]] (1998-2002) whose [[parliamentary immunity]] protected him from prosecution for [[human rights violations]] until the [[Supreme Court of Chile|Chilean Supreme Court]] revoked it in [[2000]].<br/>-<br/>-*In [[Venezuela]], the lifetime senate seat was extant from [[1961]] to [[1999]].

Some authors would include also members of the superfamily [[Hedyloidea]], the American butterfly moths.  Many butterflies have striking colours and patterns on their wings. When touched by humans, they tend to lose some scales, that look like a fine powder.  If they lose too many scales, their ability to fly will be impaired.  People who study or collect butterflies (or the closely related [[moth]]s) are called [[lepidopterist|lepidopterists]]. [[Butterfly watching]] is growing in popularity as a [[hobby]].<br/>+The Israeli wine industry is a vibrant industry, with wineries numbering in the hundreds. The wineries range in size from small boutique wineries producing only a few hundred barrels a year to the large wineries producing tens of millions of bottles per year.<br/> <br/>-Several species of butterflies need more [[sodium]] than provided by the [[nectar]] they drink from flowers.  As such, they are attracted to the sodium in [[salt]] (which the males often give to the females to ensure fertility).  As human sweat contains significant quantities of salt, they sometimes land on people, to the delight of the young at heart everywhere.<br/>+==Wine in Ancient Israel==<br/> <br/>-The scales on the butterfly wings have many properties, mostly optical, that interest scientists. The pattern they make are also seen as the best animal system for understanding the developmental and genetic processes that produce morphological variation in nature.<br/>+Wine has been produced in Israel since Biblical times. The ancient land of Israel (known at various times as Canaan, Judea and Palestine) was making wine over two thousand years before Europe. In Biblical times the wine industry was the mainstay of the economy and wine had significant ritual importance. <br/> <br/>-==The four stages in the lifecycle of a butterfly== <br/>-Unlike many insects, butterflies do not experience a [[nymph (biology)|nymph]] period, but instead go through a pupal stage which lies between the larva and the adult stage (the ''[[imago]]'').<br/>-* [[Egg (biology)|Egg]]<br/>-* [[Larva]], known as a [[caterpillar]]<br/>-* [[Pupa]] (''[[chrysalis]]'')<br/>-* Adult butterfly (''[[imago]]'')<br/>+These ancient wines lacked the quality that people have become accustomed to in modern times. They were thick and sweet and had to be seasoned just to make them palatable. No modern connoisseur would possibly have approved of them. <br/> <br/>-===Egg===<br/>-Butterfly eggs consist of a hard-ridged outer layer of shell, called the ''chorion''. This is lined with a thin coating of wax which prevents the egg from drying out before the larva has had time to fully develop. Each egg contains a number of tiny funnel-shaped openings at one end, called ''micropyles''; the purpose of these holes is to allow sperm to enter and fertilize the egg. Butterfly and moth eggs vary greatly in size between species, but they are all either spherical or ovate.<br/>+From the time of Moslem control of the region, wine production ceased and vineyards were abandoned. Moslem conquest in 636 led to a 1,200 year halt to local wine production.<br/> <br/>-===Larva===<br/>-Larvae, or [[caterpillar|caterpillars]], are multi-legged eating machines. They consume [[plant]] [[leaf|leaves]] and spend practically all of their time in  search of food. Caterpillars mature through a series of stages, called instars.  Near the end of each instar, the larva undergoes a process called [[apolysis]], in which the [[cuticle]], a mixture of [[chitin]] and specialized [[proteins]], is released from the [[epidermis]] and the [[epidermis]] begins to form a new [[cuticle]] beneath.  At the end of each instar, the larva molts the old [[cuticle]], and the new [[cuticle]] rapidly hardens and pigments.  Development of butterfly wing patterns begins by the last larval instar.  Butterflies belong to the specialized and prolific lineage of [[holometabolism|holometabolous]] insects, which means that wings or wing pads are not visible on the outside of the larva, but when larvae are dissected, tiny developing "wing disks" can be found on the second and third thoracic segments, in place of the spiracles that are apparent on abdominal segments.  Wing disks develop in association with a trachea that runs along the base of the wing, and are surrounded by a thin "peripodial membrane", which is linked to the outer epidermis of the larva by a tiny duct.  [[Image:Fifthinstarwingdisk.png|thumb|100px|left|Last instar wing disk, Junonia coenia]] Wing disks are very small until the last larval instar, when they increase dramatically in size, are invaded by branching [[tracheae]] from the wing base that precede the formation of the wing veins, and begin to express molecular markers in patterns associated with several landmarks of the wing.  Near pupation, the wings are forced outside the epidermis under pressure from the [[hemolymph]], and although they are initially quite flexible and fragile, by the time the pupa breaks free of the larval cuticle they have adhered tightly to the outer cuticle of the pupa (in obtect pupae).  Within hours, the wings form a cuticle so hard and well-joined to the body that pupae can be picked up and handled without damage to the wings.  <br/>+==Beginnings of the modern industry==<br/> <br/>-{{wrapper}}<br/>-|[[Image:Pupation_-_Inachis_io.jpg|thumb|Pupation of Inachis io]]<br/>-|[[Image:Chrysalis5504.JPG|thumb|100px|right|Chrysalis of [[Gulf Fritillary]]]]<br/>-|}<br/>+The modern Israeli wine industry was founded by Baron Edmond de Rothschild, owner of the famous Bordeaux Chateau 'Chateau Lafite'. In 1882 he supported the new wave of Jewish immigrants by sponsoring their efforts to start a viable wine industry. There were a number of inital setbacks - the soil was stony and sandy, crops did not survive the hot sun & the first vineyards were struck with phylloxera.<br/> <br/>-===Pupa===<br/>-When the larva exceeds a minimum weight at a particular time of day, it will stop feeding and begin "wandering" in in a quest for a suitable pupation site, usually the underside of a leaf.  The larva transforms into a pupa ([[chrysalis]]), which then transforms into a butterfly by [[metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]].  To transform from the miniature wings visible on the outside of the pupa into large structures usable for flight, the pupal wings undergo rapid mitosis and absorb a great deal of nutrients.  If one wing is surgically removed early on, the other three will grow to a larger size. In the pupa, the wing forms a structure that becomes compressed from top to bottom and pleated from proximal to distal ends as it grows, so that it can rapidly be unfolded to its full adult size.  Several boundaries seen in the adult color pattern are marked by changes in the expression of particular transcription factors in the early pupa.<br/>+Rothschild built two wineries, one in Zichron Ya'acov and another in Rishon LeTzion. Because of high temperatures the wine of the first vintages went sour, so deep underground cellars were constructed at enormous cost. <br/> <br/>-[[Image:Langesmetalmarkbutterfly91.jpg|thumb|right|Lange's [[Riodinidae|Metalmark Butterfly]]]]<br/>+In 1906 Baron Edmond de Rothschild passed the management of the wineries onto the growers who formed the Societe Co-operative Vigneronne des Grandes Caves and in 1957 his son, James Rothschild, donated the wineries to the wine growers cooperative. Their vineyards covered many parts of Israel, but the main concentration was in the coastal regions of Shomron & Samson. The resulting wines were sold under the brand name 'Carmel'. <br/> <br/>-===Butterfly===<br/>-The adult, sexually mature, stage of the insect is known as the imago. As Lepidoptera, butterflies have four wings that are covered with tiny scales (see photo), but, unlike moths, the fore- and hindwings are not hooked together, permitting a more graceful flight. A butterfly has six legs; the larva also has six true legs and a number of prolegs. After it emerges from its pupal stage, it cannot fly for some time, because its wings have not yet unfolded. A newly-emerged butterfly needs to spend some time 'inflating' its wings with blood and letting them dry, during which time it is extremely vulnerable to [[predator]]s. <br/>+Most of the wine produced at the time was red, sweet and unsophisticated. In 1875, then British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli was given a bottle of kosher red wine from Palestine. After taking a few sips, he observed that it tasted "not so much like wine but more like what I expect to receive from my doctor as a remedy for a bad winter cough". <br/> <br/>-[[Image:Microphoto-butterflywing2.jpg|thumb|left|Butterfly wing scales, microphotography]]<br/>+Nonetheless, at the turn of the twentieth century Carmel produced the first Israeli wine to win a medal at a wine show (Carmel No. 1 1900 was a gold medal winner at the Paris World Fair). It signaled the rebirth of a the Israeli wine industry after 2,000 years.<br/> <br/>-Many species of butterfly are [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. Some butterflies, such as the [[Monarch butterfly]], are migratory. <br/>+Well into the 1960s, Israel suffered from a reputation of producing wines too thick and sweet to appeal to true wine connoisseurs.<br/> <br/>-Butterflies are often confused with moths, but there are a few simple differences between them, including colour, habits, and pupating appearance. See the [[difference between a butterfly and a moth]].<br/>+In the 1970s Carmel began to produce Israel's first varietal wines (Cabernet Sauvignon & Sauvignon Blanc).<br/> <br/>-Butterflies live primarily on [[nectar]] from flowers. Some also derive nourishment from [[pollen]], tree sap, rotting fruit, dung, and dissolved minerals in wet sand or dirt. Butterflies are also [[pollinator]]s.<br/>+It is fair to say that Israel's move toward producing quality wines really began with one special bottle of wine - Carmel Special Reserve 1976 (released in 1980). This wine was Israel’s first serious ‘fine’ wine. The wine, which lasted over 15 years, was a definite milestone in the production of Israeli wine (the 1979 vintage was also a great success).<br/> <br/>-==Classification==<br/>-{{wrapper}}<br/>-|[[Image:Blue morpho butterfly.jpg|thumb|right|[[Blue Morpho]]]]<br/>-|-<br/>-|[[Image:Meadow Argus02.jpg|thumb|right|[[Meadow Argus]], a common species of Australia]]<br/>-|-<br/>-|[[Image:Geitoneura klugii2.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Geitoneura klugii]]'']]<br/>-|}<br/>-Although the butterflies are classified in two superfamilies, [[Hesperioidea]] and [[Papilionoidea]], these are [[sister taxon|sister taxa]], so the butterflies collectively are thought to constitute a true [[clade]].  Some modern taxonomists place them all in superfamily Papilionoidea, distinguishing the skippers from the other butterflies at the series level only.  There is only one family in the Hesperioidea (or series Hesperiiformes), the skipper family [[Hesperiidae]].  The families usually recognised<br/>-in the [[Papilionoidea]] (or Papilioniformes) are:<br/>-*[[Swallowtail]]s and [[Birdwing]]s, Papilionidae<br/>-*[[Pieridae|White]]s or Yellow-Whites, Pieridae<br/>-*[[Lycaenidae|Blues and Coppers]] or Gossamer-Winged Butterflies, Lycaenidae<br/>-*[[Metalmark butterfly|Metalmark butterflies]], Riodinidae<br/>-*[[Brush-footed butterfly|Brush-footed butterflies]], Nymphalidae<br/>+==Wine revolution==<br/> <br/>-A major new study (Wahlberg et al., 2005) combining morphological and molecular data concluded that Hesperiidae, Papilionidae, Pieridae, Lycaenidae and Riodinidae could all be strongly supported as [[monophyletic]] clades, but the status of [[Nymphalidae]] is equivocal.  Lycaenidae and Riodinidae were confirmed as sister taxa, and Papilionidae as the outgroup to the rest of the true butterflies, but the location of Pieridae within the pattern of descent was unclear, with different lines of evidence suggesting different conclusions.  The data suggested that the Hedyloidea are indeed more closely related to the butterflies than to other moths.<br/>+In the 1980s the quality revolution began in Israel, heralded by the formation of the Golan Heights Winery in 1983. Importing expertise from California, using state of the art technology and high altitude, cooler vineyards, the Golan led the country to a new dawn of quality wine. They won a host of gold medals and a number of trophies at the IWSC in London and Vinexpo in Bordeaux - in particular with their premier label, Yarden.<br/> <br/>-Some older classifications recognize additional families, for example Danaidae, Heliconiidae, [[Snout butterfly|Libytheidae]] and Satyridae, but modern classifications treat these as subfamilies within the Nymphalidae.<br/>+The Golan winery began to encourage vineyard owners to improve the quality of their grapes and, in the American tradition, paid bonuses for grapes with high sugar and acid content and rejected those which they perceived as substandard. The winery was also the first to realize that wines made from Grenache, Semillon, Petit Sirah and Carignan grapes would not put them on the world wine map and focused on planting and making wines from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, white Riesling and Gewürztraminer.<br/> <br/>-There are between 15,000 and 20,000 [[species]] of butterflies worldwide. Some well known species include:<br/>-* [[Small Tortoiseshell]], ''Nymphalis urticae''<br/>-* [[Small White]], ''Artogeia rapae''<br/>-* [[Green-veined White]], ''Artogeia napi''<br/>-* [[Monarch butterfly]], ''Danaus plexippus''<br/>-* [[Red Admiral]], ''Vanessa atalanta''<br/>-* [[Painted Lady]] or Cosmopolite, ''Vanessa cardui''<br/>-* [[Peacock (butterfly)|Peacock]], ''Inachis io''<br/>-* [[Xerces Blue]], ''Glaucopsyche xerces''<br/>-* [[Gulf Fritillary]], ''Agraulis vanillae''<br/>-* [[Black Swallowtail]], ''Papilio polyxenes''<br/>-* [[Spicebush Swallowtail]], ''Papilio troilus''<br/>-* [[Karner Blue]], ''Lycaeides melissa samuelis'' (endangered)<br/>-* [[Morpho (butterfly)|''Morpho'']] genus<br/>-* [[Birdwing|''Troides'']] genus (birdwings; the largest butterflies)<br/>-* [[Speckled Wood]], ''Pararge aegeria''<br/>+The Golan wines were a success from the beginning; their second wine, a Cabernet Sauvignon from the 1984 vintage, won a gold medal at the International Wine and Spirit Competition. <br/> <br/>-==Etymology==<br/>-An erroneous [[etymology]] claims that the word butterfly came from a [[metathesis]] of "flutterby"; however, the [[Old English language|Old English]] word was ''buttorfleoge'' and a similar word occurs in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], apparently because butterflies were thought to steal milk. An alternative [[etymology]], current in Great Britain, is that it originated as a contraction of term ''butter-coloured fly'' referring to the Brimstone Buterfly ''Gonepteryx rhamni'' often the first butterfly of Spring. <br/>+Many other wineries have made major steps forward in improving the quality of their wines. There are now six major wineries and a rapidly growing host of boutique wineries in the country, many of which are producing wines that are of high quality, and a few even producing wines good enough to interest connoisseurs and wine lovers throughout the world.<br/> <br/>-==Aerodynamics, butterflies, and flutter==<br/>-Unlike many other members of the [[insect]] world, the flight of a butterfly can be explained quantitatively (and quite accurately) using steady-state, non-transitory [[aerodynamics]].  The [[aspect ratio (wing)|aspect ratio]] of a butterfly's wing is ideal to be described using thin [[airfoil]] theory.  The fluttering of the wings merely serves to enforce the [[Kutta]] Condition of low-speed aerodynamics.<br/>+As wine writer Oz Clarke said, "Israel is now on the world wine map", and many local dry red and white wines are as good as some of the fine wines of California, Australia and others of the  "new-world" wine-producing countries. Some Israeli wines are so good that they are compared favorably to the wines of the respected chateaux of France. <br/> <br/>-==Field guides to butterflies==<br/>-[[Image:Lepidoptera 001.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Lepidoptera]]<br/>-* ''Butterflies of North America'', Jim P.

The soils are Terra Rossa on the coast, limestone on the hills, sandy clay in the south and volcanic in areas of the north. There are approximately 4,000 hectares of vineyards, which makes Israel one of the smallest of all wine producing countries. However there are a surprising number of microclimates that lie between the snow covered Mount Hermon in the northern Golan & the Negev Desert in the south. Israel is known for its advanced agriculture & technology and these come together in the vineyards. Whether it is the use of meteorological stations in the vineyards, the latest drip feed methods or planting vineyards in the desert, the Israeli viticulturist is up to date and always experimenting.<br/> <br/>+==Varietals==<br/> <br/>-<!--[[Image:Meadow argus06.jpg|thumb|220px|Meadow Argus Butterfly]]<br/>-[[Image:Meadow argus05.jpg|thumb|220px|Meadow Argus Butterfly]]<br/>-[[Image:Meadow argus04.jpg|thumb|220px|Meadow Argus Butterfly]]<br/>-[[Image:Meadow argus03.jpg|thumb|220px|Meadow Argus Butterfly]]--><br/>+The most common grape varieties are Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Sauvignon Blanc & Chardonnay. Others include Pinot Noir, Cabernet Franc, Johannisberg Riesling, Gewurztraminer & Muscat Canelli. Of the newer varieties, Syrah/Shiraz is the most promising. Numerous other varieties are available - from Petit Verdot to Viognier. There are unfortunately no indigenous varieties, though the Muscat of Alexandria, which is prominent in the Eastern Mediterranean and is used to make dessert wines, comes closest. Emerald Riesling, a cross between Johannisberg Riesling & Muscadelle is a variety which succeeded in Israel more than in California , where it was originally introduced.<br/> <br/>-==External links==<br/>-{{commons|Butterfly}}<br/>-*[http://www.arachnology.org/monteiro/Press/2002_TREE_story/Science_a_GoGo/20020211025738.shtml Butterfly Wings Key To Morphological Evolution]<br/>-*[http://cirrusimage.com/butterfly_photos.htm Reference quality large format photographs, common butterflies of North America]<br/>-*[http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/resource/distr/lepid/bflyusa/bflyusa.htm Butterflies of North America]<br/>-*[http://www.naturemagics.com/butterfly.shtm Butterflies of Southern India]<br/>+==Influences==<br/> <br/>-*[http://www.leps.nl/ Butterflies and Moths in the Netherlands]<br/>-*[http://www.leps.it/ Moths and butterflies of Europe en North Africa]<br/>-*[http://tolweb.org/tree?group=Lepidoptera Tree Of Life]<br/>-*[http://www.nss.org.sg/butterflysingapore/index.html Butterflies of Singapore]<br/>-*[http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/research/story/0,9865,1453103,00.html "Butterflies equipped with tracker devices"] by Tim Radford, ''The Guardian'', April 6, 2005<br/>-*[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Butterfly Wiktionary's butterfly page, with loads of funny-sounding translations]<br/>-*[http://www.greenpower.org.hk Shell butterfly explorer]<br/>-*[http://www.macro-photo.org/species-checklist-arthropods-insects-birds-avians/butterflies-moths-lepidoptera-macro-photo-images-gallery.htm Macro Photography - Images of Butterflies]<br/>-*[http://www.sonbaski.com/yenisite/sayi12kelebek.htm Butterflies photos]<br/>-*[http://www.fotoplatforma.pl/index.php?lg=en&str=200&pokaz=51 Butterflies pictures]<br/>-*[http://http://www.fotoplatforma.pl/en/butterflies/ European Butterflies]<br/>+Although the Israeli wine industry was built on French roots, Californian winemakers were responsible for the significant changes of the 1980s.

Sometimes referred to as '''The Virgin Queen''' (since she was never married), '''Gloriana''', or '''Good Queen Bess''', Elizabeth I was the fifth and final monarch of the [[Tudor dynasty]], having succeeded her half-sister, [[Mary I of England|Mary I]]. She reigned during a period of great religious turmoil in [[England|English]] history.<br/>+A '''parody advertisement''' is a fictional advertisement for a non-existent product, either done within another advertisement for an actual product, or done simply as parody of advertisements --used either: as a way of ridiculing or drawing negative attention towards a real advertisement or such advertisement's subject; or as a [[comedic device]], such as in a comedy skit or sketch.<br/>+==Example==<br/> <br/>-Elizabeth's reign is referred to as the [[Elizabethan era]] or the Golden Age and was marked by increases in English power and influence worldwide. Playwrights [[William Shakespeare]], [[Christopher Marlowe]], and [[Ben Jonson]] all flourished during this era. In addition, [[Francis Drake]] became the first Englishman to circumnavigate the globe; [[Francis Bacon]] laid out his philosophical and political views; and English colonisation  of [[North America]] took place under [[Walter Raleigh|Sir Walter Raleigh]] and [[Humphrey Gilbert|Sir Humphrey Gilbert]]. Elizabeth was a short-tempered and sometimes indecisive ruler. This last quality, viewed with impatience by her counsellors, often saved her from political and marital misalliances. Like her father [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], she was a writer and poet. She granted [[Royal Charter]]s to several famous organizations, including [[Trinity College, Dublin]] ([[1592]]) and the [[British East India Company]] ([[1600]]).<br/>+A parody advertisement should not be confused with a fictional brand name used in a program to avoid giving free advertising to an actual product, or to the use of a fictional brand name in an actual advertisement used for comparison, which is sometimes done as opposed to comparing the product to an actual competitor.  <br/> <br/>-The reign was marked by prudence in the granting of [[British honours system|honours and dignities]]. Only eight peerage dignities, one [[earl|earldom]] and seven [[baron|baronies]] in the [[Peerage of England]], and one barony in the [[Peerage of Ireland]], were created during Elizabeth's reign. Elizabeth also reduced the number of [[Privy Council|Privy Counsellors]] from thirty-nine to nineteen, and later to fourteen.<br/>+A parody advertisement can be one in which the advertisement appears to ''actually be a real ad for'' the false product, but then the advertisement is somehow exposed to be a parody and if it is an actual advertisement the actual brand becomes clear.  If it is simply a parody it may or may not indicate that it is one.<br/> <br/>-[[Virginia]], an English [[13 colonies|colony in North America]] and afterwards a member of the [[United States]], was named after Elizabeth I, the "Virgin Queen".<br/>+==Television==<br/>+Here are some examples of well known parody advertisements:<br/>+===Energizer Bunny===<br/> <br/>-==Early life==<br/>+In the [[1990s]], the most famous series of parody advertisements were those for the [[Energizer]] battery. A parody itself of a [[Duracell]] battery commercial, in its initial commercial episode first shown in October 1989, a toy pink rabbit, is being filmed in a commercial.  The toy, powered by the battery, escapes the studio and begins a rampage, pounding a drum and rolling through other commercials being made, including those for coffee, wine, a fictional upcoming TV series, long distance service, and sinus medication.  A total of 115 fictional commercials and 3 real ones (for [[Twinkies]], [[Purina Cat Chow]], and [[Duracell]]) in both [[English language|English]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] involving the [[Energizer Bunny]] were made.<br/> <br/>-Elizabeth was the only surviving child of King [[Henry VIII of England]] by his second wife, [[Anne Boleyn]], Marchioness of Pembroke, whom he secretly married sometime between the winter of [[1532]] and late January of [[1533]]. She was born in the [[Palace of Placentia]] in [[Greenwich]], on September 7, 1533. Henry would have preferred a son to ensure the Tudor succession, but upon her birth, Elizabeth was the [[heir presumptive|heiress presumptive]] to the throne of England.<br/>+===Eveready v. Coors===<br/>+In an ironic twist, in [[1991]], [[Eveready Battery Company]] sued the [[Adolph Coors Company]] over an ad for [[Coors]] beer it was producing, which showed [[Leslie Nielsen]] in a full-size rabbit suit pounding a drum, which was parodying Eveready's Energizer Battery commercials, which themselves are parodies of other advertisements and television program previews.  Eveready claimed Coors' ad constituted copyright and trademark infringement.  The court ruled that Coors' ad was a valid parody of Eveready's, considering that Mr. Nielsen "is not a toy, and does not run on batteries." ''[[Eveready Battery Co. v. Adolph Coors Co.]]'', [[Court citation|765 F. Supp. 440]] (N.D. Ill. 1991).<br/> <br/>-Her surviving paternal aunts included [[Margaret Tudor]] and [[Mary Tudor (queen consort of France)|Mary Tudor]]. Her maternal aunt was [[Lady Mary Boleyn]]. Her maternal uncle was [[George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford]]<br/>+===Geico===<br/>+The [[Geico]] insurance company ran a series of television commercials in which a victim in a disadvantaged situation hears their fate from the [[antagonist]], that they have good news, only the good news is for the antagonist (The antagonist will usually say as the punchline, "I just saved a bunch of money on my car insurance by switching to Geico").  Some examples involved a fictional congressional hearing where the witness (the victim) is being informed he is subject to criminal penalties while the chairman of the committee (the antagonist) has saved money on his car insurance, a home repair show reminiscent of [[Bob Vila]] showing a victim couple with a home badly in need of repair, and a fictional hair restoration commercial. Another example parodied advertisements for [[reality TV]] shows, by showing a couple getting married, and getting disgruntled at living in a tiny house (the punchline: a voiceover saying "The drama may be real, but it won't save you any money on car insurance", followed by the wife asking her spouse in their tiny [[hot tub]] "Why haven't you called Geico?").<br/> <br/>-After Queen Anne failed to produce a male heir, Henry had her executed on charges of [[treason]] (adultery against the King was considered treason), [[incest]] with her elder brother and [[witchcraft]]. Elizabeth was three years old at that time and was also declared illegitimate and lost the title of princess. Thereafter she was addressed as Lady Elizabeth and lived in exile from her father as he married his succession of wives. Henry's last wife [[Catherine Parr]] helped reconcile the King with Elizabeth, and she, along with her half-sister, Mary, daughter of [[Catherine of Aragon]], was reinstated in the line of succession after [[Edward VI of England|Prince Edward]] under the [[English Act of Succession|Act of Succession 1544]].<br/>+===Orkin===<br/>+The [[Orkin]] exterminator franchise created a series of fictional commercials in which, part way through the ad, a [[cockroach]] would walk across the screen, appearing as if there was a roach in the viewer's home.  (There are reports of people who, believe it to be an actual insect on their screen, end up damaging their TV sets attempting to kill it).  As the roach continued to move, a man wearing Orkin's [[Orkin man]] outfit of a white shirt, tie and company logo, would apply a spray of presumably insecticide to the screen from within, causing the insect to fall off.   One of their fictional ads would become famous for the inclusion of the actor [[Gary Coleman]].<br/> <br/>-Elizabeth's first governess was Lady Margaret Bryan, a baroness whom Elizabeth called "Muggie". At the age of four, Elizabeth had a new governess, Katherine Chapernowne, who was often referred to as "Kat". Chapernowne developed a close relationship with Elizabeth and remained her confidante and good friend for life. She had been appointed to Elizabeth's household before [[Anne Boleyn]]'s death. [[Matthew Parker]], her mother's favourite priest, took a special interest in Elizabeth's well-being, particularly since a fearful Anne had entrusted her daughter's spiritual welfare to Parker before her death. Later, Parker would become the first Archbishop of [[Canterbury]] after Elizabeth became queen in [[1558]]. One companion, to whom she referred with affection throughout her life, was the Irishman [[Thomas Butler, 3rd Earl of Ormonde|Thomas Butler]], later 3rd [[Earl of Ormonde]] (ob.[[1615]]).<br/>+===[[Sprite (soft drink)|Sprite]]===<br/>+The [[Coca-Cola]] company's  lemon-lime soft drink ran a series of ads for other fictional drink products, which had actual or fictional celebrities endorsing the other product, with the implication that the fictional product was inadequate for quenching one's thirst.<br/> <br/>-In terms of personality, Elizabeth was far more like [[Anne Boleyn|her mother]] than her father: neurotic, glamorous, flirtatious, charismatic and religiously tolerant. Elizabeth also inherited her mother's delicate bone structure, physique and facial features. She also inherited her mother's onyx black eyes and petite girth and not her father's enormous weight. However, from her father she did inherit her red hair. <br/>+===Saturday Night Live===<br/>+The [[United States|American]] [[Television|TV]] [[Sketch comedy|sketch comedy]] [[Television program|series]], ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', produces fictional commercials on a regular basis, shown after the guest host's monologue as a ''[[Saturday Night Live commercial|introductory commercial]]'', prior to the beginning the main show.  Many of these ads, while they parody actual TV commercials are simple ''[[Parody|comedic parodies]]'' of the ''style'' the real advertisement rather than its product.<br/> <br/>-[[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] died in [[1547]] and was succeeded by Edward VI. Catherine Parr married [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley]], Edward VI's uncle, and took Elizabeth into her household. It is believed that Seymour made advances towards Elizabeth while she lived in his household. There, Elizabeth received her education under [[Roger Ascham]].  She came to speak or read six languages: her native [[English language|English]], as well as [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Greek language|Greek]], and [[Latin]]. Under the influence of Catherine Parr and Ascham, Elizabeth was raised a [[Protestantism|Protestant]].<br/>+===Joe's Crab Shack===<br/>+The [[Landry's Restaurants, Inc.]] for [[Joe’s Crab Shack]] created 2 new fictional ads, A fictional fast food burger chain named “Shark Burger” and a fictional pizza delivery company named “Pizza Lobster.” After the parody ad ends, then [[Joe’s Crab Shack]] logo and the punchline “Joe knows crabs.”<br/> <br/>-[[Image:ElizabethTudorAt13-woc-0475.jpg|thumb|left|Elizabeth at the age of 13 by William Scrots]]<br/>-As long as her Protestant half-brother remained on the throne, Elizabeth's own position remained secure. In [[1553]], however, Edward died at the age of fifteen, having left a will which purported to supersede his father's.  Contravening the [[English Act of Succession|Act of Succession 1544]], it excluded both Mary and Elizabeth from succeeding to the throne and declared [[Lady Jane Grey]] to be his heiress. Lady Jane ascended the throne, but was [[Deposition_(politics)|deposed]] less than two weeks later. Armed with popular support, Mary rode triumphantly into London, her half-sister Elizabeth at her side. <br/>+===Carling Black Label===<br/>+The gimmick of characters from a commercial invading other spoof ads was first used by the [[British]] Lager brewers [[Carling Black Label]]. The advert featured a wild west outlaw being roped by a [[posse]] and dragging them off their horses and into adverts for a love compilation Album and Washing up powder.<br/> <br/>-Mary I contracted a marriage with the [[Spain|Spanish]] prince Philip, later King [[Philip II of Spain]], and she worried that the people might depose her and put Elizabeth on the throne in her stead. [[Wyatt's Rebellion]] in [[1554]] sought to prevent Mary from marrying Philip and, after its failure, Elizabeth was imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]]. There were demands for Elizabeth's execution, but few Englishmen wished to put a member of the popular Tudor dynasty to death. Mary attempted to remove Elizabeth from the line of succession, but Parliament would not allow it. After two months in the Tower, Elizabeth was put under house arrest under the guard of Sir Henry Bedingfield; by the end of that year, when Mary was falsely rumoured to be pregnant, Elizabeth was allowed to return to court at Philip's behest, as he worried that his wife might die in childbirth, in which case he preferred Lady Elizabeth to succeed rather than her next-closest relative, [[Mary I of Scotland]]. For the remainder of her reign, the staunchly [[Catholicism|Catholic]] Mary persecuted Protestants, and came to be known as "[[Bloody Mary (person)|Bloody Mary]]" because of a desire to present her assertion of authority as cruel. She urged Elizabeth to take the faith, but the princess kept up a skilful show of allegiance to suit her own conscience and ambitions.<br/>+===Poser Mobile===<br/>+'''Poser Mobile''' is an advertising campaign for [[T-Mobile]]'s pay-as-you-go cell phone plan.  Its television commercial has saturated the airwaves. It features a racially diverse group of [[hip-hop]] [[poser]]s.  The group of five ambush the cell phone customer and explain that he has to pay hidden charges and fees. One customer in a commercial calls them "clowns". It is somewhat of a [[parody]] on [[Boost Mobile]]'s "Where You At?" advertising campaign which features prominent [[hip-hop]] artists such as [[Ludacris]], [[Kanye West]], and [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]].<br/> <br/>-==Early reign==<br/>-[[Image:Elizabeth I of England - coronation portrait.jpg|thumb|right|275px|The coronation of Elizabeth]]<br/>-{|align="left"<br/>-|-<br/>-| {{infobox UKkingstyles|royal name=Queen Elizabeth I|image=[[Image:QEI arms.jpg|60px]]|dipstyle=[[Her Majesty]]|offstyle=Your Majesty|altstyle=Her/Your Grace, Her/Your Highness}}<br/>-|}<br/>-In [[1558]], upon Mary I's death, Elizabeth ascended the throne. She was far more popular than her sister, and it is said that upon Mary's death, the people rejoiced in the streets.<br/>+==Magazines==<br/>+===Mad Magazine===<br/>+[[Mad Magazine]] was famous for regularly running obviously fictional ads for nonexistent products. However, many of these nonexistent products were clearly intended to be parodies of specific well-known brands of real-world products; frequently, the fictional advertisement in ''Mad'' parodied a specific genuine ad campaign for a recognizable brand-name product. For example, in the 1960s (when cigarettes could still be advertised on television), Kent Cigarettes ran a commercial featuring a series of line drawings illustrating the lyrics of a catchy jingle titled "The Taste of Kent". ''Mad'' promptly ran a fake print ad, using drawings which parodied the style of the line art, illustrating verses about lung cancer and emphysema to a lyric that parodied Kent's jingle, now titled "The Taste of Death".<br/> <br/>-Elizabeth hello was crowned on [[15 January]] [[1559]]. There was no [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] at the time; [[Reginald Cardinal Pole]], the last Catholic holder of the office, had died shortly after Mary I. Since the senior bishops declined to participate in the [[coronation]] (since Elizabeth was illegitimate under both [[canon law]] and [[statute]] and since she was a Protestant), the relatively unimportant [[Owen Oglethorpe]], [[Bishop of Carlisle]] had to crown her. The [[communion]] was celebrated not by Oglethorpe, but by the Queen's personal chaplain, to avoid the usage of the Roman rites. Elizabeth I's coronation was the last one during which the Latin service was used; future coronations used the English service. She later persuaded her mother's chaplain, [[Matthew Parker]], to become Archbishop. He only accepted out of loyalty to [[Anne Boleyn]]'s memory, since he found working with Elizabeth difficult at times. <br/>+According to [[Frank Jacobs]]'s biography ''[[The Mad World of William M. Gaines]]'', Mad's parodies of real advertisements generated so much attention that Mad publisher [[William Gaines]] received requests from the promotional departments of many real products, asking Mad to run parodies of their advertisements. Gaines's standard reply to such requests: "Come up with a really stupid ad campaign, and we'll be happy to make fun of it."<br/> <br/>-One of the most important concerns during Elizabeth's early reign was religion; she relied primarily on [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Sir William Cecil]] for advice on the matter. The [[Act of Uniformity 1559]] required the use of the Protestant ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' in church services. Papal control over the [[Church of England]] had been reinstated under Mary I, but was ended by Elizabeth. The Queen assumed the title "Supreme Governor of the Church of England", rather than "Supreme Head", primarily because several bishops and many members of the public felt that a woman could not be the head of the Church. The [[Act of Supremacy 1559]] required public officials to take an oath acknowledging the Sovereign's control over the Church or face severe punishment.<br/>+===Hustler===<br/>+The most serious incident involving a fictional advertisement in a magazine caused a lawsuit which reached all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, when [[Hustler Magazine]] ran a parody of a liquor ad which would ask people about their "first time."  In the actual ad, what we are led to believe is that the person is being asked about their first sexual experience, when it turns out the question is about their first time they used the sponsor's product, a liqueur.<br/> <br/>-Many bishops were unwilling to conform to the Elizabethan religious policy.  These were removed from the ecclesiastical bench and replaced by appointees  who would submit to the Queen's supremacy. She also appointed an entirely new [[Privy Council]], removing many Catholic counsellors in the process. Under Elizabeth, factionalism in the Council and conflicts at court were greatly diminished. Elizabeth's chief advisors were Sir William Cecil, a [[Secretary of State]], and [[Nicholas Bacon|Sir Nicholas Bacon]], the [[Lord Keeper of the Great Seal]]. <br/>+In the parody advertisement in ''Hustler'', the Reverend [[Jerry Falwell]] is supposedly quoted describing the first time he had sexual intercourse with his mother in an outhouse while intoxicated.  Falwell sued Hustler Magazine and its publisher [[Larry Flynt]] for invasion of privacy, libel and emotional distress.  The jury found for the magazine on the issue of libel (the fictional advertisement clearly indicated it was a parody), but awarded Mr. Falwell $350,000 in damages for the emotional distress and invasion of privacy claims.  The Supreme Court ruled that, since the advertisement was so obviously a parody that no reasonable person could have believed it, Falwell was not libelled and thus is not entitled to damages for emotional distress, and he was not entitled to damages for invasion of privacy because he is a well-known public figure.  ''[[Hustler Magazine v. Falwell|Hustler Magazine, Inc. et al. v. Jerry Falwell]]'', [[Court citation|485 U.S. 46, (1988)]].<br/> <br/>-Elizabeth also reduced Spanish influence in England. Though Philip II aided her in ending the [[Italian Wars]] with the [[Peace of Cateau Cambrésis]], Elizabeth remained independent in her diplomacy. She adopted a principle of "England for the English". Her other realm, [[Ireland]], never benefited from such a philosophy. The enforcement of English customs in Ireland proved unpopular with its inhabitants, as did the Queen's religious policies.<br/>+===Juicy Fruit===<br/>+The [[Wrigley's]] company created fictional print ads, such as boy bands, an upcoming fictional movie poster, and a phony handheld game system.<br/> <br/>-Soon after her accession, many questioned whom Elizabeth would marry. Her reason for never marrying is unclear. She may have felt repulsed by the mistreatment of Henry VIII's wives. Alternatively, she may have been psychologically scarred by her rumoured childhood relationship with Lord Seymour. Contemporary gossip was that she had suffered from a physical defect that she was afraid to reveal, perhaps scarring from [[smallpox]]. There were also rumors that she would only marry one man, [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester]], with whom she was deeply in love.  However, her council refused to sanction the marriage because of his status and his family's participation in the [[Lady Jane Grey]] matter.  Elizabeth decided that if she couldn't have him, she would not marry at all.  It is also possible that Elizabeth did not wish to share the power of the Crown with another. It could also have been that given the unstable political situation Elizabeth could have feared an armed struggle among aristocratic factions if she married someone not seen as equally favorable to all factions. What is known for certain is that marrying anyone would have cost Elizabeth large amounts of money and independence as all of the estates and incomes Elizabeth inherited from her father, [[Henry VIII]], were only hers until she wed.<br/>-<br/>-==Conflict with France and Scotland==<br/>-The Queen found a dangerous rival in her cousin, the Catholic Mary Stuart, Queen of [[Scotland|Scots]] and wife of the [[France|French]] King [[Francis II of France|Francis II]].  In 1559, Mary had declared herself Queen of England with French support.  In Scotland, Mary Stuart's mother, [[Mary of Guise]] attempted to cement French influence by providing for army fortification against English agresssion.  A group of Scottish lords allied to Elizabeth deposed Mary of Guise and, under pressure from the English, Mary's representatives signed the [[Treaty of Edinburgh]], which led to the withdrawal of French troops.  Though Mary vehemently refused to ratify the treaty, it had the desired effect, and French influence was greatly reduced in Scotland.<br/>-<br/>-Upon the death of her husband Francis II, Mary Stuart had returned to Scotland. In France, meanwhile, conflict between the Catholics and the [[Huguenot]]s led to the outbreak of the [[French Wars of Religion]].  Elizabeth secretly gave aid to the Huguenots. She made peace with France in [[1564]]; she agreed to give up her claims to the last English possession on the French mainland, [[Calais]], after the defeat of an English expedition at [[Le Havre]].  Elizabeth, however, did not give up her claim to the French Crown, which had been maintained since the reign of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] during the period of the [[Hundred Years' War]] in the fourteenth century, and was not renounced until the reign of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] during the eighteenth century.<br/>-<br/>-==Plots and rebellions==<br/>-At the end of [[1562]], Elizabeth had fallen ill with [[smallpox]], but later recovered. In [[1563]], alarmed by the Queen's near-fatal illness, parliament demanded that she marry or nominate an heir to prevent civil war upon her death. She refused to do either, and in [[April]], she [[Prorogation|prorogued]] parliament. Parliament did not reconvene until Elizabeth needed its assent to raise taxes in [[1566]]. The [[House of Commons|House of Commons]] threatened to withhold funds until the Queen agreed to provide for the succession, but Elizabeth still refused. <br/>-<br/>-Different lines of succession were considered during Elizabeth's reign. One possible line was that of [[Margaret Tudor]], Henry VIII's elder sister, which led to Mary I, Queen of Scots. The alternative line descended from Henry VIII's younger sister, [[Mary Tudor (queen consort of France)|Mary Tudor, Duchess of Suffolk]]; the heir in this line would be the [[Lady Catherine Grey]], [[Lady Jane Grey]]'s sister. An even more distant possible successor was [[Henry Hastings, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon]], who could claim descent only from [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], who reigned during the fourteenth century. Each possible heir had his or her disadvantages: Mary I was a Catholic, Lady Catherine Grey had married without the Queen's consent and the [[Puritanism|Puritan]] Lord Huntingdon was unwilling to accept the Crown.<br/>-<br/>-Mary, Queen of Scots, had to suffer her own troubles in Scotland. Elizabeth had suggested that if she married the Protestant [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester]], then Elizabeth would "proceed to the inquisition of her right and title to be our next cousin and heir." Mary Stuart refused, and in [[1565]] married a Catholic, [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley]]. Lord Darnley was murdered in [[1567]] after the couple had several disputes, and Mary then married the alleged murderer, [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell]]. Scottish nobles then rebelled, imprisoning Mary and forcing her to abdicate in favour of her infant son, who consequently became [[James I of England|James VI]].<br/>-<br/>-In [[1568]], the last viable English heir to the throne, Catherine Grey, died. She had left a son, but he was deemed illegitimate. Her heiress was her sister, the [[Lady Mary Grey]], a hunchbacked dwarf. Elizabeth was once again forced to consider a Scottish successor, from the line of her father's sister, Margaret Tudor, Queen of Scots. Mary I, however, was unpopular in Scotland, where she had been imprisoned. She later escaped from her prison and fled to England, where she was captured by English forces. Elizabeth was faced with a conundrum: sending her back to the Scottish nobles was deemed too cruel; sending her to France would put a powerful pawn in the hands of the French king; forcefully restoring her to the Scottish Throne may have been seen as an heroic gesture, but would cause too much conflict with the Scots; and imprisoning her in England would allow her to participate in plots against the Queen. Elizabeth chose the last option: Mary was kept confined for eighteen years, much of it in [[Sheffield Castle]] and [[Sheffield Manor]] in the custody of [[George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury]], and his redoubtable wife [[Bess of Hardwick]].<br/>-<br/>-In [[1569]], Elizabeth faced a major uprising, known as the [[Northern Rebellion]], instigated by [[Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk]], [[Charles Neville, 6th Earl of Westmorland]] and [[Thomas Percy, 7th Earl of Northumberland]]. [[Pope Pius V]] aided the Catholic Rebellion by excommunicating Elizabeth and declaring her deposed in a [[papal bull|Papal Bull]]. The Bull of Deposition, ''[[Regnans in Excelsis]]'', was only issued in [[1570]], arriving after the Rebellion had been put down. After the Bull of Deposition was issued, however, Elizabeth chose not to continue her policy of religious toleration. She instead began the persecution of her religious enemies, leading to various conspiracies to remove her from the Throne.<br/>-<br/>-Elizabeth then found a new enemy in her brother-in-law, Philip II, King of Spain. After Philip had launched a surprise attack on the English privateers Sir [[Francis Drake]] and [[John Hawkins]] in 1568, Elizabeth assented to the detention of a Spanish treasure ship in 1569. Philip was already involved in putting down a rebellion in the [[Netherlands]], and could not afford to declare war on England.<br/>-<br/>-Philip II participated in some conspiracies to remove Elizabeth, albeit reluctantly. The 4th Duke of Norfolk was also involved in the first of these plots, the [[Ridolfi plot|Ridolfi Plot]] of [[1571]]. After the Catholic Ridolfi Plot was discovered (much to Elizabeth's shock) and foiled, the Duke of Norfolk was executed and Mary lost the little liberty she had remaining. Spain, which had been friendly to England since Philip's marriage to Elizabeth's predecessor, ceased to be on cordial terms. <br/>-<br/>-In [[1571]], Sir William Cecil was created [[Baron Burghley]]; a wise and humorous man, who always advised caution in international relations, he had been Elizabeth's chief advisor from the earliest days, and he remained so until his death in 1598. In [[1572]], Burghley was raised to the powerful position of [[Lord High Treasurer]]; his post as Secretary of State was taken up by the head of Elizabeth's spy network, [[Francis Walsingham|Sir Francis Walsingham]].<br/>-<br/>-Also in [[1572]], Elizabeth made an alliance with [[France]]. The [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre|St Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], in which thousands of French Protestants (Huguenots) were killed, strained the alliance but did not break it. Elizabeth even began marriage negotiations with [[Henry III of France|Henry, Duke of Anjou]] (later King Henry III of France and of Poland), and afterwards with his younger brother [[François, Duke of Anjou|François, Duke of Anjou and Alençon]]. During the latter's visit in [[1581]], it is said that Elizabeth "drew off a ring from her finger and put it upon the Duke of Anjou's upon certain conditions betwixt them two". The Spanish Ambassador reported that she actually declared that the Duke of Anjou would be her husband. However, Anjou, who is in any case said to have preferred men to women, returned to France and died in [[1584]] before he could be married.<br/>-<br/>-==Conflict with Spain and Ireland==<br/>-In [[1580]], [[Pope Gregory XIII]] sent a force to aid the [[Desmond rebellion]] in Ireland; but by 1583, the rebellion had been put down after a campaign waged by fire, sword and famine, in which almost the entire population of the north-western part of the province of Munster appears to have died; chilling, albeit approving, observations on the campaign are set out in ''A View of the Present State of Ireland'' by the poet, [[Edmund Spenser]] (first licensed for publication in 1633, four decades after it was written).<br/>-<br/>-Also in 1580, Philip II annexed [[Portugal]], and with the Portuguese throne came the command of the high seas. After the assassination of the Dutch Stadholder [[William I of Orange|William I]], England began to side openly with the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] of the Netherlands, who were at the time rebelling against Spanish rule. This, together with economic conflict with Spain and English piracy against [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonies]] (which included an English alliance with Islamic Morocco), led to the outbreak of the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585)|Anglo-Spanish War]] in [[1585]] and in [[1586]] the Spanish ambassador was expelled from England for his participation in conspiracies against Elizabeth. Fearing such conspiracies, Parliament had passed the [[Act of Association 1584]], under which anyone associated with a plot to murder the Sovereign would be excluded from the line of succession. However, a further scheme against Elizabeth, the [[Babington plot|Babington Plot]], was revealed by Sir Francis Walsingham, who headed the English spy network. Having put the court on full proof of the charge, Mary Stuart was convicted of complicity in the plot on foot of disputed evidence and executed at [[Fotheringhay|Fotheringhay Castle]] on [[February 8]], [[1587]].<br/>-<br/>-[[Image:Elizabeth I (Armada Portrait).jpg|thumb|right|350px|The above portrait was made in approximately 1588 to commemorate the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] (depicted in the background). Elizabeth I's international power is reflected by the hand resting on the globe.]]<br/>-<br/>-In her will, Mary had left Philip her claim to the English Throne; under force of the threat from Elizabeth's policies in the Netherlands and the east Atlantic, Philip set out his plans for an invasion of England. In [[April]] 1587, Sir [[Francis Drake]] burned part of the Spanish fleet at [[Cádiz]], delaying Philip's plans. In [[July]] [[1588]], the [[Spanish Armada]], a grand fleet of 130 ships bearing over 30,000 men, set sail in the expectation of conveying a Spanish invasion force under the command of the [[Alessandro Farnese, Duke of Parma and Piacenza|Duke of Parma]] across the [[English Channel]] from the Netherlands. Elizabeth encouraged her troops with a notable speech, known as the [[Speech to the Troops at Tilbury]], in which she famously declared, "I know I have the body but of a weak and feeble woman; but I have the heart and stomach of a King, and of a King of England too".<br/>-<br/>-The Spanish attempt was defeated by the English fleet under [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham|Charles Howard, 2nd Baron Howard of Effingham]] and Sir Francis Drake, aided by bad weather. The Armada was forced to return to Spain, with appalling losses on the north and west coasts of Ireland; the victory tremendously increased Elizabeth's popularity. <br/>-<br/>-The battle, however, was not decisive, and the war continued in the Netherlands, where the Dutch Estates were seeking independence from Spain. The English government was also concerned with the conflict in France and the claim to the throne of a protestant heir, Henry (later [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]]). Elizabeth sent 20,000 troops and subsidies of over £300,000 to Henry, and 8,000 troops and subsidies of over £1,000,000 to the Dutch.<br/>-<br/>-English [[privateers]] continued to attack Spanish treasure ships from the Americas; the most famous privateers included [[John Hawkins|Sir John Hawkins]] and [[Martin Frobisher|Sir Martin Frobisher]]. In [[1595]] and [[1596]], a disastrous expedition on the [[Spanish Main]] led to the deaths of the aging Sir John Hawkins and Sir Francis Drake. Also in 1595, Spanish troops under the command of [[Don Carlos de Amesquita]] landed in [[Cornwall]], where they routed a large English militia and burned some villages, before celebrating a mass and retiring in the face of a naval force led by Sir [[Walter Raleigh]].<br/>-<br/>-In 1596, England finally withdrew from France, with Henry IV firmly in control. He had assumed the throne, commenting with double-edged irony that, "Paris is worth a mass"; the [[Catholic League (French)|Holy League]], which opposed him, had been demolished, and Elizabeth's diplomacy was beset with a new set of problems; at the same time, the Spanish had landed a considerable force of [[''tercios'']] in Brittany, which had expelled the English forces that were present and presented a new front in the war, with an added threat of invasion across the channel. Elizabeth sent a further 2,000 troops to France after the Spanish took [[Calais]]. Then she authorised an attack on the [[Azores]] in [[1597]], but the attempt was a disastrous failure. Further battles continued until [[1598]], when France and Spain finally made peace. The [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585)|Anglo-Spanish War]], meanwhile, reached a stalemate after Philip II died later in the year. In part because of the war, Raleigh and Gilbert's overseas colonisation attempts came to nothing, and the English settlement of North America was stalled, until [[James I of England|James I]] negotiated peace in the [[Treaty of London, 1604]].<br/>-<br/>-==Later years==<br/>-[[Image:Nicholas Hilliard 018.jpg|thumb|Portrait by [[Nicholas Hilliard]], c. 1590]]<br/>-<br/>-In [[1598]], Elizabeth's chief advisor, Lord Burghley, died. His political mantle was inherited by his son, [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]], who had previously become Secretary of State in [[1590]]. Elizabeth became somewhat unpopular because of her practice of granting royal [[monopoly|monopolies]] the abolition of which Parliament continued to demand. In her famous "Golden Speech", Elizabeth promised reforms. Shortly thereafter, twelve royal monopolies were ended by royal proclamation; further sanctions could be sought in the courts of [[common law]]. These reforms, however, were only superficial; the practice of deriving funds from the grants of monopolies continued. <br/>-<br/>-At the same time as England was fighting Spain, it also faced a rebellion in Ireland, known as the [[Nine Years War (Ireland)|Nine Years War]]. The chief executor of Crown authority in the north of Ireland, [[Hugh O Neill, 2nd Earl of Tyrone]], was declared a traitor in [[1595]]. Seeking to avoid further war, Elizabeth made a series of truces with the earl; but during this period, Spain attempted two further armada expeditions against northern Europe, although both failed owing to adverse weather conditions. In [[1598]], O Neill offered a truce, while benefitting from Spanish aid in the form of arms and training; upon expiry of the truce, the English suffered their worst defeat in Ireland at the [[Battle of the Yellow Ford]].<br/>-<br/>-In 1599, one of the leading members of the navy, [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex]], was appointed [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] and given command of the largest army ever sent to Ireland, in an attempt to defeat the rebels. Essex's campaign was soon dissipated, and after a private parley with O Neill - in which the latter sat on horseback in the middle of a river - it became clear that victory was out of reach. In 1600, Essex returned to England without the Queen's permission, where he was punished by the loss of all political offices and of the trade monopolies, which were his principal income.<br/>-<br/>-The succession to the throne had been the ultimate political concern in England since Mary Stuart's arrival in Scotland in the 1560's, and by the end of the century there was only one question in the minds of Elizabeth's advisors: who next? It is in this context that the behaviour of Essex is best explained. In [[1601]], he led a revolt against the Queen, but popular support was curiously lacking, and the former darling of the masses was executed. <br/>-<br/>-[[Charles Blount, 1st Earl of Devon|Charles Blount, 8th Baron Mountjoy]], a bookish man who liked to wrap himself up in scarves, was sent to Ireland to replace Essex. With ruthless intent, Mountjoy attempted to blockade O Neill's troops and starve his people into submission; the campaign effectively cast the English strategy of the earlier Desmond Rebellion (1580-83) into a larger theatre, with proportionatley greater casualties. In 1601, The Spanish sent over 3,000 troops to aid the Irish, with the justification that their intervention countered Elizabeth's previous aid to the Dutch rebels in the campaign against Spanish rule. After a devastating winter siege, Mountjoy defeated both the Spanish and the Irish forces at the [[Battle of Kinsale]]; O Neill surrendered a few days after Elizabeth's death in 1603, although the fact of her death was concealed from the supplicant rebel with great skill and irony on Mountjoy's part.<br/>-<br/>-During her last ailment, the Queen is reported to have declared that she had sent "''wolves, not shepherds, to govern Ireland, for they have left me nothing to govern over but ashes and carcasses''" (''The Sayings of Queen Elizabeth'' (1925) p.?). Elizabeth's successor promoted Mountjoy to the office of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, an office in which he showed skill and moderation, until his early death in 1605.<br/>-<br/>-==Death==<br/>-Elizabeth I fell ill in February 1603, suffering from frailty and insomnia. After a period of distressing reflection, she died on [[March 24]] at [[Richmond Palace]], aged 69, the oldest English Sovereign ever to have reigned; the mark was not surpassed until [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] died in his seventy-seventh year in [[1760]]. Elizabeth was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]], immediately next to her sister Mary I. The Latin inscription on their tomb translates to "Partners both in Throne and grave, here rest we two sisters, Elizabeth and Mary, in the hope of one resurrection".<br/>-<br/>-The will of Henry VIII declared that Elizabeth was to be succeeded by the descendants of his younger sister, Mary Tudor, Duchess of Suffolk, rather than by the Scottish descendants of his elder sister, Margaret Tudor. If the will were upheld, then Elizabeth would have been succeeded by [[Lady Anne Stanley]]. If, however, the rules of male primogeniture were upheld, the successor would be James VI, King of Scots. Still other claimants were possible. They included [[Edward Seymour]], [[Baron Beauchamp]] (the illegitimate son of the Lady Catherine Grey) and [[William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby]] (Lady Anne Stanley's uncle).<br/>-<br/>-It is sometimes claimed that Elizabeth named James her heir on her deathbed. According to one story, when asked whom she would name her heir, she replied, "Who could that be but my cousin Scotland?". According to another, she said, "Who but a King could succeed a Queen?". Finally, a third legend suggests that she remained silent until her death. There is no evidence to prove any of these tales. In any event, none of the alternative heirs pressed their claims to the Throne. James VI was proclaimed King of England as [[James_I_of_England|James I]] a few hours after Elizabeth's death. James I's proclamation broke precedent because it was issued not by the new Sovereign him or herself, but by a Council of Accession, as James was in Scotland at the time. [[Accession Council]]s, rather than new Sovereigns, continue to issue proclamations in modern practice.<br/>-<br/>-==Legacy==<br/>-[[Image:Autograph of Elizabeth I of England (from Nordisk familjebok).png|thumb|300px|Autograph of Elizabeth I of England]]<br/>-Elizabeth proved to be one of the most popular monarchs in English or British history. She placed seventh in the ''[[100 Greatest Britons]]'' poll, which was conducted by the [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] in [[2002]], outranking all other British monarchs. In [[2005]], in the [[History Channel]] documentary ''[[Britain's Greatest Monarch]]'', a group of historians and commentators analysed twelve British monarchs[http://www.thehistorychannel.co.uk/site/tv_guide/full_details/British_history/programme_2652.php] and gave them overall marks out of 60 for greatness (they were marked out of 10 in six categories, such as military prowess and legacy). Elizabeth I was the winner, with 48 points.<br/>-<br/>-Many historians, however, have taken a far more dispassionate view of Elizabeth's reign. Though England achieved military victories, Elizabeth was far less pivotal than other monarchs such as [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]. Elizabeth has also been criticised for supporting the English [[slave trade]]. Her problems in Ireland also serve to blemish her record. <br/>-<br/>-Elizabeth was a successful monarch, helping steady the nation even after inheriting an enormous national debt from her sister Mary. Under her, England managed to avoid a crippling Spanish invasion. Elizabeth was also able to prevent the outbreak of a religious or civil war on English soil. Her achievements, however, were greatly magnified after her death. She was depicted in later years as a great defender of Protestantism in Europe. In reality, however, she often wavered before coming to the aid of her Protestant allies. As Sir Walter said in relation to her foreign policy, "Her Majesty did all by halves".<br/>-<br/>-Many artists glorified Elizabeth I and masked her age in their portraits. Elizabeth was often painted in rich and stylised gowns. Elizabeth is often shown holding a [[sieve]], a symbol of virginity. <br/>-<br/>-[[Benjamin Britten]] wrote an opera, ''[[Gloriana]]'', about the relationship between Elizabeth and Lord Essex, composed for the coronation of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom]].<br/>-<br/>-Notable portrayals of Queen Elizabeth in film and television have been plentiful; in fact, she is the most filmed British monarch. Those who have made an impression in the role of Elizabeth in the last 100 years, have included [[France|French]] actress [[Sarah Bernhardt]] in ''[[Les Amours de la reine Élisabeth]]'' (1912), [[Florence Eldridge]] in ''[[Mary of Scotland]]'' (1936), Flora Robson in ''[[Fire Over England]]'' ([[1937]]) and ''[[The Lion Has Wings]]'' ([[1939]]), [[Bette Davis]] in ''[[The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex]]'' ([[1939]]) and ''[[The Virgin Queen]]'' ([[1955]]) and [[Jean Simmons]] in ''[[Young Bess]]'' ([[1953]]). In recent years, the story of Elizabeth has been filmed more than ever. In [[1998]] [[Australian]] actress [[Cate Blanchett]] made her big break and received an [[Academy Award]] nomination for Best Actress for her critically acclaimed performance in ''[[Elizabeth (film)|Elizabeth]]''. The same year [[United Kingdom|British]] actress [[Judi Dench]] won an [[Academy Award]] for her supporting performance as the Virgin Queen in the popular ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'', a performance of only eleven minutes (the shortest ever to win an Oscar). In television, the actresses [[Glenda Jackson]] (in the BBC drama series ''[[Elizabeth R]]'' in [[1971]], and the [[1972]] historical film ''[[Mary, Queen of Scots (movie)|Mary Queen of Scots]]'') and [[Miranda Richardson]] (in the [[1986]] classic [[BBC]] sitcom ''[[Blackadder]]'' &mdash; a comic interpretation of Elizabeth known fondly as [[Queenie]]) both played the role with consummate talent, creating memorable (if wildly contrasting) portraits of Elizabeth I.<br/>-<br/>-There have been many novels written about Elizabeth. They include: ''I, Elizabeth'' by [[Rosalind Miles]], ''The Virgin's Lover'' and ''The Queen's Fool'' by [[Philippa Gregory]], ''Queen of This Realm'' by [[Jean Plaidy]], and ''Virgin: Prelude to the Throne'' by [[Robin Maxwell]]. Elizabeth's story is spliced with her mother's in Maxwell's book ''The Secret Diary of Anne Boleyn.'' Maxwell also writes of a fictional child Elizabeth and Dudley had in ''The Queen's Bastard.'' Decades ago, [[Margaret Irwin]] produced a trilogy based on Elizabeth's youth: ''Young Bess,'' ''Elizabeth, Captive Princess'' and ''Elizabeth and the Prince of Spain.''<br/>-<br/>-In children's and young adults' fiction, Elizabeth's story is told in ''Elizabeth I, Red Rose of the House of Tudor,'' a book in the Royal Diaries series published by Scholastic, and also in ''Beware, Princess Elizabeth'' by Carolyn Meyer.<br/>-<br/>-==Style and arms==<br/>-[[image:QEI_arms.jpg|thumb|Coat of Arms of Elizabeth I]]<br/>-<br/>-Like her predecessors since Henry VIII, Elizabeth used the [[Style_%28manner_of_address%29|style]] "Majesty", as well as "Highness" and "Grace". "Majesty", which Henry VIII first used on a consistent basis, did not become exclusive until the reign of Elizabeth's successor, James I.<br/>-<br/>-Elizabeth I used the official style "Elizabeth, by the Grace of God, [[List of monarchs of England |Queen of England]], [[English Kings of France | France]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland| Ireland]], [[Fidei defensor]], etc.". Whilst most of the style matched the styles of her predecessors, Elizabeth I was the first to use "etc.". It was inserted into the style with a view to restoring the phrase "of the [[Church of England]] and also of [[Church of Ireland | Ireland]] in [[Earth]] Supreme Head", which had been added by Henry VIII but later removed by Mary I. The supremacy phrase was never actually restored, and "etc." remained in the style, to be removed only in [[1801]].<br/>-<br/>-She has been retroactively known as Queen Elizabeth I since the accession of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] in [[1952]].  Prior to that time she was referred to as Queen Elizabeth.<br/>-<br/>-Elizabeth's [[heraldry|arms]] were the same as those used by [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]]: ''Quarterly, Azure three fleurs-de-lys Or (for [[France]]) and Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or (for [[England]])''. Whilst her [[Tudor dynasty | Tudor]] predecessors had used a gold [[lion]] and a red [[European dragon | dragon]] as heraldic supporters, Elizabeth used a gold lion and a gold dragon. Elizabeth also adopted one of her mother's mottoes, ''Semper Eadem'' ("Always the Same").<br/>-<br/>-==See also==<br/>-*[[Anglo-Spanish War (1585)]]<br/>-*[[Church of England]]<br/>-*[[Eighty Years' War]]<br/>-*[[English Renaissance]]<br/>-*[[List of British monarchs]]<br/>-*[[The Military Revolution]]<br/>-*[[Protestant Reformation]]<br/>-<br/>-==References==<br/>-*Eakins, Lara E.

This is for three reasons:<br/>+# We need to make sure that the basic concepts are well covered , not just compounds.  [[Wikipedia 1.0]] is looking likely as a publication in the next year or two, but even our basic article on [[chemistry]] was assessed as "C-grade" recently (I have requested reasons why it is apparently so bad!). <br/>+# I think the chemists should be supplying a variety of topics for FAC.  Although I think chemical substance articles are the bricks on which we build our section of Wikipedia, I think having 7 out of 9 featured articles on substances is a bit skewed.  <br/>+# Until we have [[WikiProject:Chemical reactions]], [[WikiProject:Physical chemistry]] and [[WikiProject:Chemists]], these other topics must be handled from this WikiProject.

I think I would like to see us start on the main Chemistry article, then consider perhaps some other key general topics like [[organic chemistry]] or [[physical chemistry]], but we can debate that. We can put these in our "goals" below, we don't need to have them in our COTM.

In my work with WP 1.0 I have noticed that many of the broader WikiProjects are almost inactive for this reason.  However I think I would like to suggest we list 30 general topics (e.g., [[solution]]), 10 famous chemists (e.g. [[Robert Burns Woodward]]) and 10 important chemical reactions or processes (e.g., [[nucleophilic substitution]]) and 10 important industrial processes (e.g. [[Contact process]]).

I think the fact that we already have a cohesive group of '''chemists''' with Wiki experience means we have something useful to offer, if they're interested. Chemistry has its own specific foibles and problems, only chemists fully appreciate that.  [[User:Walkerma|Walkerma]] 04:01, 23 November 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:Hm...well, what do you think should be the next step then? --[[User:HappyCamper|HappyCamper]] 04:13, 23 November 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+My guess is that at least the folks at C&E News liked the idea, and ACS is open to it.  I'd like to get comments from several project members, once they have had a chance to read the original letter. If people are interested, I could contact people in ACS directly as a representative of the project, and present whatever people think is appropriate. I am hoping to present something on Wikipedia to the chemical information folks at an ACS conference, if that works out that may also be a good venue to raise the topic. [[User:Walkerma|Walkerma]] 04:20, 23 November 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+I should say, if there are others (HappyCamper?) here who have better contacts at ACS than me I'd love for them to take the initiative on this.  I only suggested that I ''could'' do it, assuming that others aren't interested/able (eg our many Europeans). [[User:Walkerma|Walkerma]] 04:25, 23 November 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:Martin, I think your idea is excellent.  I would like to help.  To summarize for everyone else, Matthew Stone is suggesting a Wiki that offers the posting and editing of topics such as:<br/>+::1) Peer-reviewed procedures<br/>+::2) Up-to-date collaborative research reviews<br/>+::3) Peer-reviewed techniques<br/>+:Assuming these goals, I believe the Wikipedia is neither adequate nor appropriate.  It is not adequate because such a chemistry-intensive wiki would have to have some sort of structure drawing/displaying software readily available.  (If you haven't noticed, it's quite difficult to draw a structure or scheme in an article.)  Wikipedia is not appropriate because it's an encyclopedia, not a reaction database.<br/>+<br/>+:However, Wikipedia is an excellent place for goal #2.  That is something that we can work on right now, right here.<br/>+<br/>+:A good secondary goal for working with the ACS would be to encourage more chemists to become Wikipedians.<br/>+:[[User:~K|~K]] 05:46, 23 November 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+Reading the overall idea, I understand that the proposal is to have an ACS Wiki website (similar to Wikipedia) for doing the things that the ACS does. And that is a good proposal. But I don't see the ACS (or any other chemicals society) as an organization contributing to Wikipedia. They may recommend to they chemists members to have a look at Wikipedia (notably these Chemistry and Chemicals WikiProjects) and suggest that they too contribute. [[User:Wimvandorst|Wim van Dorst]] 23:15, 23 November 2005 (UTC).<br/>+<br/>+:That's true. At least for me, I'll keep this in the back of my head and follow up with it whenever I get a chance to. --[[User:HappyCamper|HappyCamper]] 13:39, 26 November 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+== A scheme for schemes ==<br/>+<br/>+In present Wikipedia practice, the usual way to write a scheme or chemical equation, if the structures involved are complex enough that they do not easily reduce to text, is to upload the entire scheme or equation as a single image.  This works, but it does not support much image reuse.<br/>+<br/>+There are advantages to representing schemes as tables of images, where each structure gets its own image.  Off the top of my head, some of these advantages are:<br/>+* The scheme is somewhat editable<br/>+* The images can be used in other schemes<br/>+* By including a redirect on the image page, clicking on part of the scheme will link to the article for the compound clicked on<br/>+* Each image in the scheme can have its own alt text, so hovering over part of the scheme could pop an explanatory note relevant to that location<br/>+<br/>+In order to look good, however, the component images will have to be visually compatible with one another.  This, combined with the usefulness of putting redirects on the image pages (noted above), which might be more annoying than useful if those images are used outside schemes, suggests that it would be good if the component images were somehow marked as being primarily intended for use in chemical diagrams, perhaps with some prefix in the filename; e.g., sch-acetic_acid.png chem-acetic_acid.png rgt-acetic_acid.png, or somesuch.<br/>+<br/>+Also, in order for diverse editors to produce visually compatible images, there must exist some agreement on what the "standard" image appearance is.  I think resizing will be inconvenient in this context; rather, it would be better to simply agree on matters like standard bond length, line thickness, symbol font. etc.<br/>+<br/>+E.g.:<br/>+<br/>+{| style="text-align: center;"<br/>+| [[Image: Test-benzene.png|Benzene]]<br/>+| [[Image: Test-h2.png|Hydrogen]] <br/> [[Image: Test-arrow-right.png]]<br/>+| [[Image: Test-cyclohexane.png|Cyclohexane]]<br/>+| [[Image: Test-o2.png|Oxygen]] <br/> [[Image: Test-arrow-right.png]]<br/>+| rowspan=2 |<br/>+[[Image: Test-cyclohexanol.png|Cyclohexanol]] <br/><br/>+[[Image: Test-plus.png]] <br/><br/>+[[Image: Test-cyclohexanone.png|Cyclohexanone]]<br/>+|-<br/>+| colspan=3 | [[Image: Test-adipic_acid.png|Adipic acid]]<br/>+| [[Image: Test-hno3.png|Nitric acid]] <br/> [[Image: Test-arrow-left.png]]<br/>+|}<br/>+<br/>+[[User:Shimmin|Shimmin]] 13:27, 25 November 2005 (UTC)<br/>+:Hey, I really like this! I've always thought it was a shame we couldn't do links in schemes, now you've solved it!  As you say, we need to agree on sizes & fonts.  I have a system I like to use on ChemDraw for schemes, I will post it when I get home.  I'd be interested in hearing K's comments too, he posts a lot of schemes.

Thanks for this great idea, [[User:Walkerma|Walkerma]] 02:54, 26 November 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::: There are no dynamic elements in this, so the wikicode only has be rendered once.  On a per-page basis, this ought to be no more taxing than any other page that contains several images, and the images themselves are only a few kb each. [[User:Shimmin|Shimmin]] 13:10, 26 November 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::I like it too!!! :-) -- this just opens a host of possibilities...we can be a small set of reusable symbols and use them in reactions and in the articles themselves! --[[User:HappyCamper|HappyCamper]] 02:57, 26 November 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:Shimmin, I must congratulate you on a most ingenious way of portraying schemes.  I like it and I don't.  What I really should say is that my first impression was one of horror, but over the years I've learned never to go with my first impression.  You missed one HUGE positive for using these tables: with enough pieces, you can write schemes without having to use a chemical drawing program like ChemDraw or ISISDraw.  That, in itself, is huge.  One question I get asked the most often is: How can I draw schemes like that?  It's always the same answer: Get yourself a program to do it for you.  However, with this system, one could write a simple scheme without a chemical drawing program.  I think if we could make chemical drawing programs a thing of the past, Wikipedia would be a much nicer place.<br/>+<br/>+:The alt text is another huge plus, because additional useful information could be embedded in a page.<br/>+<br/>+:However, there are a number of problems we should think about:<br/>+::1) It will not save us any time writing schemes for pages.  Although images will be reused, to describe some new reaction or scheme or whatnot, we will likely have to upload at least one new structure.  If we have to upload two structures or more, then this system is already taking longer to use.  <br/>+::2) The wikicode is rather complex.  I realize that the schemes will typically be simpler than the above table, but I would be hard pressed to make a table more complex than that.  And, yes, to become a world-class chemistry reference, we will be making more difficult schemes than that.  (Please see [[Nicolaou Taxol total synthesis]] for an excellent example.)<br/>+::3) Standardizing everyone's images will be a living nightmare.  It can be done, but it will take lots of work.<br/>+:::3b) V8rik uses alot of color in his images.  I do not, but am trying to use more.  Color usage would also have to be standardized, which may do more harm than good.<br/>+<br/>+: This system is well designed for describing simple chemistry, like stuff encountered in sophomore organic chemistry.  This system is not well designed for the complex schemes like total syntheses or reaction mechanisms.<br/>+<br/>+: One problems to consider is also a practical one: to make this system become useful, ALOT of structures must be uploaded.  Short arrows, long arrows, left arrows, right arrows, toluene with the methyl up, toluene with the methyl down, probably every compound in WPChemical's worklist, etc...<br/>+<br/>+: I propose that we use this system for a single page.  Our own little experiment.  Is it easy to code?  Does it work within the Wikipedia?  Does it look any better than the current page?  Does it clarify any of the reactions?  I propose [[Electrophilic aromatic substitution]], because there will be lots of benzene image reuse, and the page need serious help.  If it works for everyone, then we can discuss standardizing image specifications, and further steps needed.  <br/>+:[[User:~K|~K]] 06:40, 26 November 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::I completely agree with K's comments: let's do two or three trial runs to see how it works in practice. It would also be helpful if  everyone could post the preferences (and the program) they are currently using for structures: we may well have problems of capatability between drawing programs... <br/>+::I will be drawing some simple schemes for [[sodium amide]] this weekend, I will give it a go. [[User:Physchim62|Physchim62]] [[User talk:Physchim62|(talk)]] 08:23, 26 November 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+Here are my reflections on building the above example.<br/>+<br/>+* Breaking a scheme up into individual images was not really a pain.  Once I had the scheme drawn in ChemDraw, I had to save each individual part of the scheme as a separate image file.  This was only mildly tedious, and balanced by the fact that I did not have to spend time tweaking the positions of the pieces of the scheme to make everything line up nicely.<br/>+* Resizing all these images would have been a pain, but I use [[IrfanView]].  IrfanView is free software that makes batch image manipulation relatively painless.<br/>+* Individually uploading all these images to Wikipedia, and giving them redirects to the various compound pages, was a real pain.  If I am going to do this on a regular basis, I will figure out how to automate it with [[wget]].<br/>+* Building the table was not a pain.  For me, it was the easiest part of the process.<br/>+<br/>+In conclusion, since any scheme of even moderate complexity will likely need a few "pieces" not already in the library, even when the library is well-developed, building complex schemes this way will always be more work than uploading them as a single image, and the question is whether that additional work is worth having links and alt-text for individual regions of the scheme.  However, simple chemical equations (A + B -> C + D) will be very easy to embed once the library is well developed. [[User:Shimmin|Shimmin]] 12:53, 26 November 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+: For the record, the example images were made using default ChemDraw settings, except that TNR label text was done in Arial instead, then saved as PNG images and downsized to 33% of their original size with IrfanView. [[User:Shimmin|Shimmin]] 13:01, 26 November 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::I don't have access to this software at the moment. Would something from [[Wikisophia]] be good? --[[User:HappyCamper|HappyCamper]] 13:38, 26 November 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:I meant to mention, if you don't have access to ChemDraw, you can go to www.mdli.com and download ISIS Draw for Windows for free.  I wrote my PhD dissertation with an older version of it than this free version, and I still use Isis for most of my teaching, as I am more comfortable with it.  For a typical example of an image drawn in Isis then scanned see [[:Image:Schlosser_Wittig.gif|this]].  You can see some discussion on Isis [[User_talk:Walkerma#ISIS_Draw_help|here]] and in the section following that.  However we still need to spend a bit of time comparing formats and agreeing on standards. Though rather than creating our own settings, I wonder if we should standardise on one of the standard journal settings which are easily accessible in both Isis and ChemDraw. [[User:Walkerma|Walkerma]] 06:05, 3 December 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+<br/>+Should each scheme have a link to [[Structural formula]] to allow a lay reader to understand what the scheme means?

Can you check the valency article?  If it means the same thing, then the two may need to be merged.  I've learnt (the hard way!) that it is often good to check the alphabetical index of articles to see if someone has written an article with a similar (but not identical) name to the one I'm writing. [[User:Walkerma|Walkerma]] 20:09, 30 November 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::I wish I had checked this page before doing major expansion and reconstruction to [[User:Kilo-Lima|Kilo-Lima]]'s Valence articles (chalk one up to learnin the hard way).  While [[valency]] does mean the same subject as [[valence number]], IUPAC regards valence number as the most correct term. Oxidative State refers to electronic configuration and spin as well as distribution, so while all elements have one valence value they can have multiple oxidative states (albeit not at the same time).[[User:Das Nerd|Das Nerd]] 00:21, 1 December 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:Thanks anyway, hopefully we can incorporate some of your input if we merge the articles.  However, surely elements can have multiple valencies (or should I say valence numbers?)?  For example can't carbon have a valence no. of 4 in carbon tetrachloride but 2 in [[dichlorocarbene]]?  Do you have the IUPAC reference, it may guide us regarding a possible merge of the two articles, and it should be in the article anyway. Thanks [[User:Walkerma|Walkerma]] 04:48, 1 December 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+The IUPAC reference is [http://www.iupac.org/goldbook/V06588.pdf here], to [[valence]]!

Since its early beginning, [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Elements]] uses (and mostly kept) the systematic data from http://www.webelements.com/ for its "''Group, Period, Block''" entries in the infoboxes of the chemical element articles.<br/>+<br/>+WebElements.com omits the group numbers for the lanthanides and actinides. It is supported by the [[ungrouped elements]] page. On the other hand, that article gives no reference and might be a self-running soap bubble based on the circular reasoning that we never included group numbers.<br/>+<br/>+It seems just as reasonable to assume lanthanides and actinides altogether are an inset of group 3 (and thus part thereof), below scandium and yttrium. There's the occasional edit to the infoboxes in this regard. What bugs me, trifle that it is, this basic definition affects the consistency of quite a number of articles.<br/>+<br/>+The definition at [[periodic table group]] as a "''vertical column in the periodic table''" is not at all clear, and the discussion at [[talk:periodic table]] about whether or not Lu and Lr are placed into group 3 would not make sense if they'd be group 3 in any case. The [[group 3 element]] article puts them all in group 3 but other than that is no help either and it lost me at "''All of these elements are classed in Group 3 because their outer electron shells hold three electrons.''"<br/>+<br/>+So, the question is '''what the heck is group 3 anyway'''? Is this a matter of convention without clear definition (like what's part of the lanthanides), and one might find references either way if one digs deep enough? None of the above comes close to being a definite, authoritative reference. Could a real chemist set this straight please? [[User:Femto|Femto]] 18:09, 13 January 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:I, too, would very much like to know whether some or all of the f-block elements are considered part of [[group 3 element|group 3]], and if so, which.  I have promised to check the IUPAC Red Book soon, but that may take a week. --''[[User:Nrcprm2026|James S.]]'' 22:28, 13 January 2006 (UTC)<br/>+::I've checked the ''[http://www.iupac.org/reports/provisional/abstract04/RB-prs310804/Chap3-3.04.pdf Red Book]'' (IR-3.6) for you, and it doesn't seem to give much help. The current definitions are inconsistent, as they admit themselves, as to whether the lanthanoids start at [[lanthanum]] or [[cerium]]: this is the result of a compromise, as can be seen in the definition of transition element.  [[IUPAC]] never went near the question as to how they numbered the "groups" in the f-block, although they did institute a new numbering for the other groups which has now been largely accepted. My advice would be that elements between cerium and [[ytterbium]] and between [[thorium]] and [[nobelium]] have no accepted group number. The situation is more difficult for lanthanium, [[lutetium]], [[actinium]] and [[lawrencium]], but the current Wikipedia practice of placing La and Ac in group 3 is widely followed in published periodic tables. Hope this helps! [[User:Physchim62|Physchim62]] [[User talk:Physchim62|(talk)]] 16:55, 14 January 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:Very much. So they can tackle the spelling of aluminium, but they chicken out on the basic definitions? :) See further [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Elements#Group number convention]]. Hope I got it all right. [[User:Femto|Femto]] 19:52, 14 January 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::I note that [[Group 3 element]] currently lists lanthanides and actinides as members, should this be updated?  Or should we just say "some authorities also include the following as members of group 3, but IUPAC has not yet made an official ruling." [[User:Walkerma|Walkerma]] 15:29, 17 January 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:::For the time being, it should suffice to make the page more neutral and less definite. The exact nature of the example becomes secondary then. (The latest addition has only muddled it further I'm afraid. First there's "''elements in group 3 (IUPAC style):''", then "''it seems that IUPAC does not include the Lanthanides and the Actinides in group 3''". That's not neutral, that's confusing.) See also the talk that followed at WikiProjectElements about my opinions on the need for more coordination of these pages and the strict separation between neutral descriptions and defining coherent examples. [[User:Femto|Femto]] 17:18, 17 January 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::::If I might might venture my opinion, IUPAC haven't bothered to give a precise definition here because there isn't a precise and useful definition to be had! The concept of verticle groups, whilst provided a marvellous way to label several elements together and compare trends in the properties in *some* cases (eg alkali metals, noble gases, halogens...), isn't that much use for the f-block. Already in the d-block, horizontal trends begin to be important, and by the f-block, horizontal trends are key. People doing comparative chemistry on actinides and lanthanides look horizontal, not in vertical groups. There are certainly very few useful vertical comparisons to be made between the bulk of the actinide sequence, and scadium and yttrium. Defining a 'Group 3' largely makes most sense in terms of electronic configuration, in which case you can make the best case for Group 3 being a d-block group of Sc, Y, Lu, Lr, and have the lanthanides and actinides as f-block footnotes. You can also compare this scheme to a Group 3 of Sc, Y, Ln, Ac - although Ln and Ac do have more behaviour involving partially-filled f-orbitals, so this is second best. --[[User:Feline1|feline1]] 16:59, 19 January 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::::Wikipedia should not follow http://www.webelements.com in terms of the layout of the table because the webelements table is misleading.  IUPAC is definite about Lu being a lanthanoid and Lr an actinoid (see the second to last page here: http://www.iupac.org/reports/provisional/abstract04/RB-prs310804/Chap3-3.04.pdf). The webelements administrator wrote last summer: "We could certainly argue that my WebElements home page (and a lot of books) is a bit loose in that I have labelled the first row of the f-block as lanthanoid without making it clear that Lu is one as well. I'll find a way to clarify that..." but they haven't done so yet.  See the lengthy (and sometimes very silly) discussion here: http://forums.webelements.info/viewtopic.php?t=2334&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=0. I think an encyclopedia should represent conventions the best way it can without making stuff up, so I was surprised by the [[ungrouped elements]] article, since I've never heard this term before. [[User:Flying Jazz|Flying Jazz]] 00:57, 21 January 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+Please check out the changes at the [[group 3 element]] article and the replacement of the "ungrouped elements" article with the [[group number of lanthanides and actinides]] article.

The Political fight continued from the thirties on till independance in 1956 and beyond. King Mohamed V died in 1961, but already in 1956 Morocco claimed the Spanish Sahara, that is to say, it is not untill Hassan II took power in 1961 that Morocco started to claim what it sees belongs to it. So "Greater Morocco" was not a tool for getting people to fight for independance.

This has a goal to make the reader believe that it is the reason the king claimed Spanish Sahara. Well, first, there were only two coups d'état, in 1971 and  1972. I would like to know where and when was this third. The [[Green March]] happened in November 1975. How could the coups d'etat  be related to the March???. I am more inclined to believe that a country with a weak economy would rather avoid armed conflicts for which it has no means, and a country with an unstable political situation will have no advantage making new external enemies that would surely harbour and strengthen its internal enemies.

Bear in mind that Morocco was made a protectorate with the assistance of the Moroccan monarchy. Unless I'm missing something here, you directly contradict yourself in this sentence:<br/>+:"[i]n 1956 Morocco claimed the Spanish Sahara ... it is not untill [sic] Hassan II took power in 1961 that Morocco started to claim what it sees belongs to it."<br/>+*They claimed the [[Senegal River]] and its interior border, including the city of [[Saint-Louis]]. Re: Tony Hodges' ''Western Sahara: Roots of a Desert War'', p.88 (map on p.87) "The claim to Saint-Louis in Senegal was also quietly shelved" after the claims to Mali were dropped in 1960. The source of his map is the Georapher from the U.S. Department of State.<br/>+*It is certainly true that Hassan redoubled efforts for the Sahara during economic crisis and political instability. The article may well be mistaken about the number of attempted coups. The [[Green March]] occured ''after'' decades of posturing for the Sahara. The article isn't claiming that there is an association between the coup attempts and the Green March. While it is wise that "a country with a weak economy would rather avoid armed conflicts for which it has no means," there is no reason to assume that Hassan II is wise. See, for instance, North Korea, where Kim Jong-il can't feed his population, and he's politically and geographically isolated from almost everyone else in the world, but he's got a huge military and possibly nuclear weapons for some reason.<br/>+*If you have potential re-wordings for certain passages, feel free to suggest them. -[[User:Koavf|Justin (koavf)]], [[User talk:Koavf|talk]], [[Special:Emailuser/Koavf|mail]] 15:51, 20 June 2006 (UTC)<br/> <br/>-== Featured articles ==<br/>-(in alphabetical order)<br/>-* [[BC Rail]] - front page feature [[October 4]] [[2005]]<br/>-* [[Căile Ferate Române]] - front page feature [[July 22]] [[2005]]<br/>-* [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] - front page feature [[April 23]] [[2005]]<br/>-* [[Cincinnati, Lebanon and Northern Railroad]]<br/>-* [[Franklin B.

I think, Justin, you don't need anyone to explain to you what is propaganda ;-).<br/>+* Greater Morocco is a legitimate claim for Morocco and it has its roots in the glorious past of the country. It has been ruled by great dynasties that left the Moroccans proud of their past. Believe me, many of Morocco's neighbors envy them that past. When all the rest of the Arab World was under Othoman rule, Morocco was standing as an independent empire, exchanging embassadors and treaties with Europe's greatest kingdoms, and was by the way the first to recognize your country. The longest standing unbroken treaty of friendship the US has with any foreign country is the one signed with the Moroccan Empire in 1783. So to say that the idea of Greater Morocco was created by Istiqlal or it is for propaganda reasons is simply not true.<br/>+*The protectorate was imposed on Morocco, and was due to its weakness. The fact that it is signed by the Moroccan monarchy does not mean it was assisted by it.<br/>+*there was no contradiction in the sentence. Maybe I did not phrase well. Here it is again: "The claims of Morocco on Spanish Sahara started already in 1956 ... they did not start when Hassan II took power in 1961."<br/>+*Please, please. If sometnig is a fact, you should not have problem finding sources for it. So, don't bother yourself quoting Hodges. He is the main reference and source of intox in Polisario sites. So, are there any neutral sources?<br/>+*As to the late King Hassan's wisdom, you can say what you want. His funerals were attended by all the world's prominent leaders including all the living US presidents. I don't think they would bother make the trip say farwell to an unwise person. I read about events related to the conflict of WS, and the balance of power that existed, the diplomatic battle raging in North Africa in the 70s prior to 1976, and when against manoevers from Spain, Algeria, Libya, etc,.. today after more than 30 years, the Moroccan flag is in the skies of WS, I think he was more than wise. --[[User:SteveLo|SteveLo]] 10:12, 19 July 2006 (UTC)<br/> <br/>-==== Current candidates ====<br/>-These pages (in alphabetical order) are currently [[WP:FAC|candidates]] for Featured Article status.

It's also totally irrelevant if you think [[Greater Albania]] or [[Greater Finland]] are legitimate (they're not.) That changes nothing about the nature of the claims or the terms. Of course Nazis ''thought'' that the [[Final Solution]] was legitimate, and Mao ''thought'' the [[Great Leap Forward]] was legitimate. Propagandizers probably do believe what they're saying; that doesn't change the nature of propaganda. The NPOV policy on Wikipedia prohibits us from writing in the context of an article whether or not controversial claims like this are legitimate. That is to say nothing of the evidence against Greater Morocco (lack of historical administration, cruel treatment of Sahrawis, the invasion of a sovereign state or two, the debunking of all other Greater Morocco claims, etc.) The idea of Greater Morocco was of course created by Istiqlal. From where did it come if not them?<br/>+*If the monarchy signed on to a policy and the monarch is sovereign, that's the policy. That's the nature of monarchy. The protectorate was actually beneficial to the monarch, as there were violent tribes in the south looking to overthrow him, and Spaniards defended the throne.<br/>+*This statement is correct. Morocco claimed the Sahara from 1956.<br/>+*If you don't like Hodges or if you don't think he's neutral, that's also totally irrelevant. The fact is, his book is the standard reading on the Sahara in English. He has copious footnotes that you can check if you don't trust him. His book has never been debunked, and he's trustworthy until proven otherwise. You can't simply reject a source out of hand because you don't like the facts they present. The burden of proof is on you to prove that this source is somehow untrusthworthy; that the claims he presents are not true.<br/>+*They made the trip to his funeral as a goodwill gesture, since Morocco was pro-West under his leadership. It has nothing to do with how wise he was. You could just as easily say "I read about the events related to the conflict of Transjordan, and the balance of power that existed, the diplomatic battle raging in the Middle East in the 30s prior to 1948, and when against manoevers from Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, Syria, etc,.. today after more than 50 years, the Israeli flag is in the skies of Palestine, I think David Ben Guiron was more than wise." The simple fact that you win in a conflict (or are the occupying power of a majority of a territory during a ceasefire) does not show wisdom, virtue, benevolence, or any admirable trait at all; it simply shows that you were ahead in a military conflict. You also could have written this in 1954 "I read about the events related to the conflict of the Moroccan protectorate, and the balance of power that existed, the diplomatic battle raging in North Africa in the 90s prior to 1912, and when against manoevers from France, Spain, the Sultan of Morocco, etc,.. today after more than 50 years, the Spanish flag is in the skies of Morocco, I think the King of Spain was more than wise." -[[User:Koavf|Justin (koavf)]], [[User talk:Koavf|talk]], [[Special:Emailuser/Koavf|mail]] 13:35, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</td>

In 1851, the school moved from its original location at 16th and Market Streets to 8th and Cerre Streets in downtown St. Louis where the name changed to the "Academy of Christian Brothers."  In December of 1855, the school was granted a college charter becoming the first institution of the Brothers in the United States to operate at the collegiate level.<br/>-<br/>-In 1882, due to lack of space, the school once again relocated to the "Cote Brilliante" campus in north St. Louis City on the northeast corner of Easton Ave. and N.

The school building was annexed several times due to constantly increasing enrollment.  The Hi-Pointe campus served CBC students for 82 years.<br/>-[http://www.csl.edu/CBCExterior_15.jpg Picture]<br/>-<br/>-In 1998, the CBC Board of Directors announced that the school would once again relocate to a new campus in west St. Louis County, eight miles west of the Clayton campus.  The property is located at the northwest corner at the intersection of Highway 40 and I-270.

The [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] Romani language should not be confused with either [[Romanian language|Romanian]] (spoken by [[Romanians]]), or [[Romansh language|Romansh]] (spoken in parts of southeastern [[Switzerland]]), both of which are [[Romance languages]].<br/>+<br/>+==Classification and status==<br/>+Analysis of the Romani language has shown that it is closely related to those spoken in northern India, [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] in particular. This linguistic relationship is believed to indicate the Roma's and Sinti's geographical origin. Loanwords in Romani make it possible to trace the pattern of their migration west.  They came originally from the [[Indian Subcontinent]] or what is now northern [[India]] and parts of [[Pakistan]]. The Romani language is usually included in the Central Zone languages (together with Western [[Hindi]], [[Bhili]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Khandeshi]], [[Rajasthani]] etc.).  Current conjecture is that the origin of the name ''Sinti'' is the same as that of the [[toponym]] for the [[Sindh]] region of southeastern Pakistan and far western India ([[Rajasthan]] and [[Gujarat]]), around the lower [[Indus River]].  It was primarily through [[comparative linguistics|comparative linguistic]] studies of the Romani language with various north Indian dialects and languages that the origins of the Roma people were traced back to India.<br/>+<br/>+Romani, Punjabi, and [[Pothohari]] share some identical words and similar grammatical systems.  One recent theory reported in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', however, suggests that Romani is most closely related to [[Sinhalese language|Sinhala]].<br/>+<br/>+The Romani language is considered alternatively a group of dialects or a collection of related languages that comprise all the members of a single genetic subgroup.<br/>+<br/>+While the language is nowhere official, there are attempts currently aimed at the creation of a standard language out of all variants (such as those from [[Romania]], the [[United States|USA]], [[Sweden]]). Also, different variants of the language are now in the process of being codified in those countries with high Roma populations (for example, [[Slovakia]]).<br/>+<br/>+==History==<br/>+There are no sure historical documents about the early phases of the Romani language. It was cited in the epic ''Shah Name'' by the 11th century [[Persian people|Persian]] poet [[Firdausi]]. He wrote about the 10,000 or 12,000 [[Desi]] musicians who were given in the 5th century AD by King [[Shankal]] of [[Kanauj]] (in [[Sindh]]) to [[Bahram Gur]] the [[King of Persia]] and it was pointed out that they should be the ancestors of the Roma.<br/>+<br/>+However, new research (Masica, 1991:221) shows this to be unlikely. The Romani language proves to be a New Indo-Aryan language (NIA), not a [[Middle Indo-Aryan languages|Middle Indo-Aryan]] (MIA), as it would have to be to fit Firdausi's scheme. It has only two [[grammatical gender|genders]] (masculine and feminine). Until around the year 1000, the Indo-Aryan languages (named MIA) had three genders (masculine, feminine and neuter). By the turn of the 2nd millennium they changed into the NIA phase, losing the neuter gender. Most of the neuter nouns became masculine while a few feminine, like the neuter अग्नि (agni) in the Prakrit became the feminine आग (āg) in Hindi and याग (yag) in Romani. The parallels in grammatical gender evolution between Romani and other NIA languages is proposed to prove that the change occurred in the Subcontinent.  It is therefore believed that it was not possible that the Romas' ancestors left there prior to 1000.<br/>+<br/>+It is known that the period of time around 1000 AD was one of great turmoil in the northern part of the Indian Subcontinent. The [[Islamic empires in India|Muslim invasions]] wrought havoc and led to massive population movements. The scholar [[Ian Hancock]] and also [[W.R. Rishi]] wrote that the Roma ancestors left the Subcontinent as a result of these circumstances. Between the years 1001 and 1026, the Muslim [[Afghan people|Afghans]] and [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] known as [[Ghaznavid Empire|Ghaznavids]] made seventeen invasions in the Punjab and Sindh areas, fighting against the local Hindus. The [[Rajput]]s played a major role in the resistance. They were a mixture of different [[jāti]] (castes) brought together by a common desire to repel the foreign invaders. There are accounts that many of them were captured and sent to Central Asia to be used as conscripts in further fighting, and that others left the war zone, heading west.<br/>+<br/>+These movements of population involved many categories, because the Rajputs would go to war with their families and their associates frequently. The Romani language sustains the claimed Rajputic ancestry: most of the words related to war are of Indo-Aryan ancestry like ''bust'' (spear), ''patava'' (gaiters), ''xanrro'' (sword), ''tover'' (axe)[http://radoc.net]. The name for those who are not Roma, ''gaje'' derives from [[Prakrit]]ic ''gajja'' (civilian, domestic, non-military). There is an 80% match of Romani words of [[Persian language|Persian]] origin with the Persian words in [[Urdu]]. The latter is the Indo-Aryan language (with many Persian and Arabic loans) that evolved in the new society of [[Desi]] converts to [[Islam]] or those captured by the Muslims (Urdu means ''army''). Also there are cultural similarities between Roma and Rajputs and [[DNA]] research demonstrates genetic proximity.<br/>+<br/>+The short-lived [[Ghaznavid Empire]] was [[polyglot]], but Persian was official. This could explain the share of Persian [[loanword]]s in Romani, loans from no earlier than 10th century Persian. However, the greatest changes to the Romani language occurred much further West. The [[Seljukids|Seljuks]] (who defeated the Ghaznavids in 1038), also defeated [[Armenia]] in 1071 and conquered eastern [[Anatolia]].<br/>+<br/>+Historical documents relate the subsequent movement of populations from [[Central Asia]] to eastern Anatolia. It seems that it was here that, according to Ian Hancock's thesis, the Romani language evolved as a [[koine]] from the many Indo-Aryan languages spoken by the ancestors of the Roma. The original status of Romani as a [[lingua franca]] is supported by the vocabulary of Indo-Aryan origin. It cannot be linked to a certain area, but it includes words from all across the northern Subcontinent. During its development, it underwent a certain degree of influence from the local Greek. This influence is secondary in weight after the Indo-Aryan ancestry of the language, both in vocabulary and in grammar (there are some suffixes of Greek origin). Other Anatolian languages contributed to the creation of Romani as well (most notably [[Armenian language|Armenian]]).<br/>+<br/>+This is also when it seems that the Roma developed their identity as a distinct people, abandoning the jātī differences. Moreover, they had to adapt to the life of the foreign lands and find economic niches for survival. Analysis of Romani vocabulary indicates that the Romas' ancestors were not originally nomadic. Indo-Aryan words like ''kher'' (house), ''udar'' (door), [http://rmy.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gav gav] (village), ''thagar'' (king), ''balo'' (pig), ''khaini'' (hen), [http://rmy.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giv giv] (wheat) seem to indicate a settled society instead. Words related to nomadism come from Anatolia, where this lifestyle first became a common for the Roma. For example, ''grast'' (horse) and ''char'' (grass) are from Armenian, ''vurdon'' (waggon, cart) is from [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [http://rmy.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drom drom] (road) and ''petalo'' (horseshoe) are from Greek. Also the skills of [[metalworking]] were acquired here: the words for [[metal]]s (except for those for [[gold]], [[silver]] and [[iron]], which are Indo-Aryan) are from Greek and Armenian, as well as for the tools used in this field.<br/>+<br/>+The [[Mongol invasion of Europe]] beginning in the first half of the [[13th Century]] triggered another westward migration. The Roma arrived in [[Europe]] and afterwards spread to the other continents. The great distances between the scattered Romani groups led to the development of local community distinctions. The differing local influences have greatly affected the modern language, splitting it into a number of different (originally exclusively regional) dialects.<br/>+<br/>+Today Romani is spoken by small groups in 42  European countries [http://www.standards.dfes.gov.uk/ethnicminorities/raising_achievement/gypsy_travellerachievement/]. A project at [[Manchester University]] in [[England]] is transcribing Romani dialects, many of which are on the brink of extinction, for the first time.<br/>+[http://www.llc.manchester.ac.uk/Research/Projects/romani/]<br/>+<br/>+==Modern language==<br/>+Today's dialects of Romani are differentiated by the vocabulary accumulated since their departure from Anatolia, as well as through [[sound shift|divergent phonemic evolutions]] and grammatical features. Many Roma no longer speak the language or speak various new [[contact language]]s from the local language with the addition of Romani vocabulary.<br/>+<br/>+A long-standing common categorisation was a division between  the ''Vlax'' (from ''[[Vlach]]'') from ''non-Vlax'' dialects.  ''Vlax'' are those Roma who lived many centuries in the territory of Romania. The main distinction between the two groups is the degree to which their vocabulary is borrowed from [[Romanian language|Romanian]].  Vlax-speaking groups include the great number of speakers (between half and two-thirds of all Romani speakers). [[Bernard Gillad Smith]] made first this distinction and coined the term ''Vlax'' in 1915 in the book ''The Report on the Gypsy tribes of North East Bulgaria''. Subsequently, other groups of dialects were recognized, primarily based on geographical and vocabulary criteria, including:<br/>+<br/>+*[[Balkan Romani language|Balkan Romani]]: in [[Turkey]], [[Albania]], [[Greece]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Serbia and Montenegro]], [[Romania]], [[Moldova]] and [[Ukraine]]<br/>+*[[Welsh Romani language|Romani of Wales]]''<br/>+*[[Kalo Finnish Romani language|Romani of Finland]]<br/>+*[[Sinte Romani language|Sinte]]: in [[Austria]], [[Croatia]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Poland]], [[Serbia and Montenegro]], [[Slovenia]], and [[Switzerland]]<br/>+*[[Carpathian Romani language|Carpathian Romani]]: in the [[Czech Republic]], [[Poland]] (particularly in the south), [[Slovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Romania]], and [[Ukraine]]<br/>+*[[Baltic Romani language|Baltic Romani]]: in [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Poland]] (particularly in the north), [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Russia]]<br/>+*Turkish dialects:<br/>+**Rumeli (Thrace) dialect ([[Thrace]], [[Uskudar]], a district on the Anatolian side of the [[Bosphorus]]): most loanwords are from Greek<br/>+**Anatolian dialect.

The Kurds call them ''Mytryp'' (settled ones).<br/>+<br/>+In the past several decades, some scholars have worked out a categorisation of Romani dialects from a linguistic point of view on the basis of historical evolution and [[isogloss]]es. In a series of articles (beginning from 1982), [[Marcel Courthiade]] proposed a new classification. He concentrates on the dialectal diversity of Romani in three successive strata of expansion, using the criteria of phonological and grammatical changes. Finding the common linguistic features of the dialects, he presents the historical evolution from the first stratum (the dialects closest to the Anatolian Romani of the 13th century) to the second and third strata. He also names as "pogadialects" (after the ''[[Pogadi]]'' dialect from [[Great Britain]]) those which have only a Romani vocabulay grafted into a non-Romani language.<br/>+<br/>+A table of some dialectal diferencies:<br/>+{| class="wikitable"<br/>+|-<br/>+| '''First stratum'''<br/>+| '''Second stratum'''<br/>+| '''Third stratum'''<br/>+|-<br/>+| phirdom, phirdyom<br/>+phirdyum, phirjum<br/>+| phirdem<br/>+| phirdem<br/>+|-<br/>+| guglipe(n)/guglipa<br/>+guglibe(n)/gugliba<br/>+| guglipe(n)/guglipa<br/>+guglibe(n)/gugliba<br/>+| guglimos<br/>+|-<br/>+| pani<br/>+khoni<br/>+<br/>+kuni<br/>+| pai, payi<br/>+khoi, khoyi<br/>+<br/>+kui, kuyi<br/>+| pai, payi<br/>+khoi, khoyi<br/>+<br/>+kui, kuyi<br/>+|-<br/>+| ćhib<br/>+| shib<br/>+| shib<br/>+|-<br/>+| jeno<br/>+| zheno<br/>+| zheno<br/>+|-<br/>+|po<br/>+|po/mai<br/>+|mai<br/>+<br/>+|}<br/>+<br/>+The first stratum includes the oldest dialects: ''Mechkari'', ''Kabuji'', ''Xanduri'', ''Drindari'', ''Erli'', ''Arli'', ''Bugurji'', ''Mahajeri'', ''Ursari'' (''Rićhinari''), ''Spoitori'' (''Xoraxane''), ''Karpatichi'', ''Polska Roma'', ''Kaale'' (from [[Finland]]), ''Sinto-manush'', and the so-called ''[[Baltic countries|Baltic]] dialects''.<br/>+<br/>+In the second there are ''Chergari'', ''Gurbeti'', ''Jambashi'', ''Fichiri'', ''Filipiji'' and a subgroup of the Vlax dialects of Romania and [[Bulgaria]].<br/>+<br/>+The third comprises the rest of the so-called Vlax dialects, including ''Kalderash'', ''Lovari'', ''Machvano''.<br/>+<br/>+==Standardization==<br/>+There are independent groups currently working toward standardizing the language, including groups in Romania, Serbia and Montenegro, the USA, Sweden, etc.<br/>+A standardized form of Romani is used in Serbia, and in Serbia's autonomous province of Vojvodina Romani is one of the officially recognized languages of minorities having its own radio stations and news broadcasts.<br/>+In Romania, the country with the largest identifiable Roma population, there is a unified teaching system of the Romani language for all dialects spoken in the country. This is primarily a result of the work of [[Gheorghe Sarău]], who made Romani textbooks for teaching Roma children in the Romani language. He teaches a purified, mildly [[prescriptive]] language, choosing the original Indo-Aryan words and grammatical elements from various dialects. The pronunciation is mostly like that of the dialects from the first stratum. When there are more variants in the dialects, the variant that most closely resembles the oldest forms is chosen, like ''byav'' instead of ''abyav'', ''abyau'', ''akana'' instead of ''akanak'', ''shunav'' instead of ''ashunav'' or ''ashunau'', etc.<br/>+<br/>+An effort is also made to derive new words from the vocabulary already in use, ''i.e.'', ''xuryavno'' (airplane), ''vortorin'' (slide rule), ''palpaledikhipnasko'' (retrospectively), ''pashnavni'' (adjective). There is an ever-changing set of borrowings from Romanian as well, including such terms as ''vremea'' (weather, time), ''primariya'' (town hall), ''frishka'' (cream), ''sfïnto'' (saint, holy). [[Neologism]]s taken from [[Hindi language|Hindi]] include ''bijli'' (bulb, electricity), ''misal'' (example), ''chitro'' (drawing, design), ''lekhipen'' (writing) and from [[English language|English]] (''printisarel'', ''prezidento'').<br/>+<br/>+Language standardization is presently also being employed in the revival of the Romani language among various groups (in Spain, Great Britain and elsewhere), which have ceased to speak the language. In these cases, a specific dialect is not revived, but rather a standardized form derived from many dialects is learned.<br/>+<br/>+==Romani loanwords in English==<br/>+Romani has lent many words to English, including ''posh'', ''pal'', ''dukes'' (meaning fists, as in the expression "put up your ''dukes''"), and ''lollipop''. These mostly turn up in slang&mdash;such as ''gadgie'' (man), ''shiv'' or ''chiv'' (knife), or  ''cooshtie'' (good) &mdash; and in regional dialects, such as ''radge''  (''adj'' bad or angry, ''noun'' a state of irritation) and ''jougal'' (dog) in south east Scotland and ''parni'' (water) and ''bewer'' (woman) in West [[Yorkshire]] in [[England]], also seen as ''beor'' in [[Cork]]onian slang within [[Hiberno-English]]. Urban British slang shows an increasing level of Romani influence, with some words becoming accepted into the lexicon of standard English (for example, ''[[chav]]'' from an assumed Anglo-Romani word, possibly ''charvy'' meaning either "baby" or "mate" depending on context, ''chavi'' meaning male child or ''charver'' meaning prostitute).<br/>+<br/>+==Distribution==<br/>+<br/>+{| class="wikitable"<br/>+|+ Distribution of Romani speakers in Europe according to Bakker et al.

The magazine also is known for its journalism&mdash;[[John Hersey]]'s ''[[Hiroshima (Hersey)|Hiroshima]]'' filled an entire issue&mdash;and for its criticism and essays, particularly the short "Talk of the Town" pieces.

Determining what's "fair" tends to be case-by-case analysis, and the US may well be the most liberal jurisdiction in that regard, but the principle is internationally available.''<br/>-<br/>-That may well be true, but as I read the Berne Convention, it does ''not'' require signatory states to provide any exemptions from copyright protections except requiring the right for citing (Art. 10(1)). Art. 10(2) allows other exemptions, but doesn't define which ones, and certainly doesn't require any. Art. 10(3) requires crediting in any case. And the whole document doesn't define what "fair practice" ''is'', anyway.<br/>-<br/>-Hence "[[fair use]]" or "[[fair dealing]]" images need not only evaluated on a case-by-case basis here on Wikipedia: each and every re-user will have to re-do this case-by-case analysis to see whether the copyright laws in his country ''do'' actually have any copyright exemptions in the sense of 10(2) of the Berne Convention. For instance, the German "Urheberrecht" [http://bundesrecht.juris.de/bundesrecht/urhg/], Para. 44 - 63, does have a few exemptions, but typically for private reproduction (or within a closed audience), and typically only for non-commercial purposes. The Swiss Urheberrecht [http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/sr/231_1/], Art. 19 - 28, is similar, but only allows private uses. Both the German and the Swiss law allow citing, and allow news reporting to re-use works relevant to the news item, as far as necessary for the news report. French law is also similar: private uses, short citations, and news reporting are allowed, but no other exemptions exist [http://www.educnet.education.fr/juri/auteur4.htm].<br/>-<br/>-Thus stating that the principle was "internationally available" is a bit misleading. [[User:Lupo|Lupo]] 14:27, 13 Aug 2004 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-:Thanks for your answer, Michael. I'm glad to see that apparently my layman's understanding of the matter is not too far off the mark. (I suppose you'd have told me if I were seriously mistaken.) Of course "fair use" may be allright for re-users subject to U.S. law, but I find this U.S.-centric argument strangely inconsistent with Jimbo's declared goal of distributing Wikipedia in other parts of the world (and not necessarily via the Internet through servers based in the U.S., but through local publishers in Africa, the UK or elsewhere). I have no idea about copyright laws in African counties, but for a re-user based in the UK (or in France, or Germany, or Switzerland, and I suspect in fact in a whole slew of other countries) "fair-use" images are in fact ''not'' free at all. I just cannot understand how this can be reconciled with the idea of a free (as in "libre") encyclopedia.<br/>-<br/>-:And because I don't understand this, I cannot understand Jimbo's dislike of "free for non-commercial use only" images. Such images are - in all the countries mentioned above - at least as "free" or "un-free" as "fair use" images, and for non-commercial re-users in these countries even more free, because they are not subject to any "fair practice" copyright exemptions that may differ between countries or even may be non-existent at all in some countries, but can be re-used legally by any non-commercial publisher anywhere. [[User:Lupo|Lupo]] 11:58, 14 Aug 2004 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-==International fair use==<br/>-Hi, I was wondering if you could point me to any relevant case law where a copyright holder and copyright infringer were citizens of different countries.  Specifically, I'm trying to determine what would the result in the following scenarios:<br/>-<br/>-#Wikipedia uses an image whose copyright is held by a US citizen under the fair use doctrine on a website hosted and accessed in Germany.<br/>-#A German citizen uses an image whose copyright is held by a US citizen under the fair use doctrine on a website hosted and accessed in Germany.<br/>-#Wikipedia uses an image whose copyright is held by a German citizen under the fair use doctrine on a website hosted and accessed in Germany.<br/>-#A German citizen uses an image whose copyright is held by a German citizen under the fair use doctrine on a website hosted and accessed in Germany.  This situation is actually clear though, the copyright holder can sue the infringer in German court and win.<br/>-<br/>-Substitute "German" for any country other than the US.  What I'm trying to find out is where such a case would take place, and whether or not fair use would apply.  I don't expect you to actually answer the question, but I was hoping you could at least point me in the right direction.  If you're not sure, perhaps we could take this question to the mailing list?<br/>-<br/>-[[User:Anthony DiPierro|anthony]] [[User:Anthony_DiPierro/warning|(see warning)]] 16:26, 13 Aug 2004 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-You say that "citizenship per se is not usually a decisive issue."  I suspected that this was the case.<br/>-<br/>-Now, you mention a US citizen having "a copyright under German law" and the initial publication taking place in Germany.  Your answer here makes sense, but my question goes to the case where the initial publication takes place in the US (does this make it "a copyright under US law" as opposed to "a copyright under German law"?).<br/>-<br/>-What I ''really'' want to know the answer to doesn't have a well defined location of infringement, but to simplify things I'm just putting everything in one location.<br/>-<br/>-So, clearly a German is not protected under the fair use doctrine for infringment of a German work (first published in Germany), when that infringement takes place solely in Germany.  And by the fact that citizenship is not generally a decisive issue, it's unlikely that a US citizen would be protected under the fair use doctrine for infringement of a German work (first published in Germany), when that infringement takes place solely in Germany.  By taking place solely in Germany I mean that the server serving the infringing work is located in Germany and it is being accessed by clients in Germany.  Presumably this wouldn't be affected by the fact that the US citizen lives in the US and uses a shell account to set up and run a website which serves the work.  Whether or not this would change with a server located in the US and clients accessing the site from Germany is less clear, but I would think that likewise the location of infringement would be Germany (admittedly I'm basing this on precedent in US law, though, such as the Sklyarov case).  All of this assumes, of course, that there is some sort of incentive for the lawsuit to be made in the first place.  For instance, perhaps the US infringer has some sort of revenue coming in from Germany which the German courts could somehow garnish.<br/>-<br/>-Now, changing the work to a US work (first published in the US), things become unclear to me.  Since we're assuming the citizenship doesn't matter, I'll present a single scenario.  A German citizen copies a US work (first published in the US) in violation of German copyright law.  The copying indisputably takes place solely in Germany.  This copying would be legal under US copyright law, under the fair use doctrine.  Does the copyright holder have any recourse against the copyright infringer?  Presumably the case would take place in German court (or at least it could), but would the doctrine of fair use apply?<br/>-<br/>-I ask this question because one of the biggest arguments against having so called "fair use images" in Wikipedia is that these images cannot legally be redistributed outside the US.  But it seems that this is not the case, at least not for US works (first published in the US).<br/>-<br/>-Once again I understand if you can't answer my questions definitively, and in some cases there might be no one who can.  I did look at the Itar Tass case, but that seemed to only bring up more questions rather than answer any.<br/>-<br/>-[[User:Anthony DiPierro|anthony]] [[User:Anthony_DiPierro/warning|(see warning)]] 19:38, 13 Aug 2004 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-But then what you're saying is that the citizenship, in this case, might be the decisive issue.  Or are you saying that a US citizen could (successfully) sue another US citizen in a German court for engaging in copyright infringement in Germany which would have been perfectly legal (under fair use) had it been done in the US?  Or maybe you're saying that a German court just isn't going to take such a case between two Americans?  I guess that last possibility is plausible.<br/>-<br/>-Oh well, there goes most of my hope on making things simple.  I think Wikipedia benefits greatly from the ability to use fair use, and in any event I think Wikipedians are unwilling to give up that ability.  But at the same time I find it troublesome that Wikipedia produces and distributes a so called "free" product which is illegal for citizens in just about any country other than the US to distribute.  I'm starting to fear the only real solution is for Wikipedia to get big enough to obtain free licenses for the content it intends to distribute, at least licenses which allow redistributions in encyclopedias.  And that's a long way away.<br/>-<br/>-As for the issue of the Berne Convention, I was actually arguing the opposite: that it protects the rights of non-US citizens in the US.  I guess I didn't phrase it very well, as you and Raul both (mis)interpreted what I was saying the same way.<br/>-<br/>-[[User:Anthony DiPierro|anthony]] [[User:Anthony_DiPierro/warning|(see warning)]] 22:23, 13 Aug 2004 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-"I think the answer is that if a US citizen publishes a copyrighted work in the US, then sues another US citizen in German court, for copying that work in Germany, then the fair use defense under US law is probably not available."  I guess that's just one of the many reasons companies like to rely on licenses (which are usually easy to obtain) rather than fair use.  It would make things strange, though.  It is illegal to distribute "Pretty Woman", the 2 Live Crew parody, outside the United States?

Obviously, the game makers didn't expect that much patience from the players because the SS Anne hadn't returned yet.--[[User:TorreFernando|Fern]] 13:37, 11 Jul 2004 (UTC)<br/>-::::::::::Let's just assume that Jessie and James are both 17 and that Meowth is 3 years old (although he's very mature for his age, probably about 17).<small>—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:{{{1}}}|{{{1}}}]] ([[User talk:{{{1}}}|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/{{{1}}}|contribs]]) {{{2|}}}.</small><!-- [Template:Unsigned] --><br/>-::::::::::Let's not assume Meowth is any age as pokemon are pretty much digital animals and so if anything is "ageless" in this cartoon, it should be pokemon.

Taiwan's political status is complicated by the controversy over the Republic of China's existence as a state, in other words, the '''political status of the Republic of China'''.<br/>+<br/>+Currently, Taiwan; [[Quemoy|Kinmen]] (Quemoy), [[Wuchiu]] (Wuciou), [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]], etc. off the coast of mainland [[Fujian|Fukien]]; and [[Taiping (island)|Taiping]] (Itu Aba) and [[Pratas]] in the [[South China Sea]] effectively make up the entire [[state]] known as the [[Republic of China]] (ROC). The ROC ruled territories on the continent that include [[mainland China]], [[Outer Mongolia]] and [[Tannu Uriankhai]] (part of which is present day [[Tuva]]) before its government was relocated to Taipei in 1949. <br/>+<br/>+Since the ROC [[China and the United Nations|lost its United Nation seat]] in 1971 ([[UN General Assembly Resolution 2758|replaced]] by the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC)), most sovereign states have switched their diplomatic recognition to the PRC, recognising or acknowledging the PRC to be the sole legitimate representative of all China, notably the [[United States]] in 1979. As at 2006, it maintains official diplomatic relations with 25 sovereign states, although ''de facto'' relations is maintained with many. Agencies such as the [[Taipei Economic  and Cultural Representative Office]] and [[American Institute in Taiwan]] are operating as ''de facto'' embassies, although they do not enjoy many diplomatic privileges and their staffs do not have any [[diplomatic immunity]].<br/>+<br/>+The ROC government has in the past considered itself to be the sole legitimate government over all [[China]], as well as its former territories. This position started to be largely ignored in the early [[1990s]], changing to one that does not challenge the legitimacy of PRC rule over mainland China, although the ROC's claims have never been renounced through a constitutional amendment.  Different groups have different concepts of what the current formal political situation of Taiwan is. (''See also: [[Taiwan independence]], [[Chinese reunification]], and [[Cross-Strait relations]]'')<br/>+<br/>+In addition, the situation can be confusing because of the different parties and the effort by many groups to deal with the controversy through a [[policy of deliberate ambiguity]].  The political solution that is accepted by many of the current groups is the following perspective of the [[status quo]]: that is, to unofficially treat Taiwan as a state and at a minimum, to officially declare no support for the government of this state making a formal declaration of independence. What a formal declaration of independence would consist of is not clear and can be confusing given the fact that the People's Republic of China has never controlled Taiwan since its founding and the fact that the Republic of China, whose government controls Taiwan, considers itself a ''[[de jure]]'' sovereign state. The status quo is accepted in large part because it does not define the legal status or future status of Taiwan, leaving each group to interpret the situation in a way that is politically acceptable to its members.  At the same time, a policy of status quo has been criticized as being dangerous precisely because different sides have different interpretations of what the status quo is, leading to the possibility of war through [[brinkmanship]] or miscalculation.<br/>+<br/>+== Background ==<br/>+<br/>+{{main|History of Taiwan}}<br/>+<br/>+Taiwan, including the [[Pescadores]], was ceded by [[China]] (then under the [[Qing Dynasty]] to [[Japan]]) in 1895. Japan surrendered it in 1945 at the end of World War II after [[History of Taiwan#Japanese Rule|50 years of colonial rule]], and it became a province of the Republic of China (ROC). Upon losing the [[Chinese civil war]] in 1949, the ROC government was relocated to Taipei, and kept control over a few islands along the coast of [[mainland China]] and in the [[South China Sea]], while the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) was established on the mainland in October 1949, which claimed to be a [[succession of states theory|successor]] to the ROC.<br/>+<br/>+[[Quemoy]], [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]] and [[Wuchiu]] on the coast of [[Fujian|Fukien]], and [[Taiping (island)|Taiping]] and [[Pratas]] in the [[South China Sea]], are part of the ROC's present territory, but were not ceded to Japan. Some arguments supporting the independence of Taiwan do not apply to these islands.<br/>+<br/>+== Question of sovereignty ==<br/>+<br/>+{{Main|Legal status of Taiwan}}<br/>+<br/>+=== Cession, retrocession and self-determination of Taiwan ===<br/>+<br/>+[[Image:Japan 1911.jpg|thumb|right|230px|At the establishment of the ROC in 1912, Taiwan was ''de jure'' part of [[Japan]].]]<br/>+<br/>+[[China]], during the [[Qing Dynasty]], ceded the island of Taiwan, including the [[Pescadores]] (Penghu), to [[Japan]] "in perpetuity" at the end of the [[Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895)|First Sino-Japanese War]] by signing the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]]. In the [[Cairo Conference]] of [[1943]], the allied powers agreed to have Japan restore "all the territories Japan has stolen from the Chinese", which included Taiwan and the Pescadores, to the Republic of China upon Japan's surrender. According to both the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China, this agreement was given legal force by the [[Instrument of Surrender of Japan]] in [[1945]]. The PRC's UN Ambassador, [[Wang Yingfan]] (Chinese 王英凡), has stated multiple times in the UN general committee: "Taiwan is an inseparable part of China’s territory since antiquity" and "both the 1943 [[Cairo Declaration]] and the 1945 [[Potsdam Declaration]] have reaffirmed in unequivocal terms China’s sovereignty over Taiwan as a matter of international law." <br/>+<br/>+On the other hand, a number of supporters of [[Taiwan independence]] argue that Taiwan was only formally incorporated as a Chinese territory under the [[Qing Dynasty]] in 1683, and as a province in 1885. Subsequently, because of the Shimonoseki Treaty of 1895, Taiwan had been ''[[de jure]]'' part of Japan when the ROC was established in 1912 and thus was not part of the Chinese republic. However, the Unification supporters point out that "the Qing Dynasty" was universally accepted as a historical name for China. Thus, the ROC government was a succession of Qing China. Also, because the [[Cairo Conference|Cairo Declaration]] was an unsigned press communiqué, the independence advocates argue that the legal effectiveness of the Declaration is highly questionable. Furthermore, they point out that the Instrument of Surrender of Japan was no more than an [[armistice]], a [[Modus Vivendi]] in nature, which served as a temporary or provisional agreement that would be replaced with a [[peace treaty]].  Therefore, the independence supporters assert that both the [[San Francisco Peace Treaty]] and [[Treaty of Taipei]] hold the legal supremacy over the surrender instrument and that these treaties did not transfer the title of Taiwan from Japan to China. According to this argument, the sovereignty of Taiwan was returned to the people of Taiwan when Japan renounced sovereignty of Taiwan in the San Francisco Peace Treaty (SFPT) in 1951, based on the policy of [[self-determination]] which has been applied to "territories which detached from enemy states as a result of the Second World War" as defined by article 76b and 77b of the [[United Nations Charter]] and also by the protocol of the [[Yalta Conference]]. However Unification supporters counter that neither the Republic of China (ROC) nor the People's Republic of China(PRC) signed on to the San Francisco Peace Treaty (SFPT), rendering the SFPT as having no legally binding power regarding Taiwan's sovereignty status. Independence advocates point out that at the end of World War II, allied powers agreed that the Republic of China was to "temporarily occupy Taiwan, on behalf of the Allied forces" under the authorization from General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s [[General Order No. 1]] of September 2, 1945. The Unification supporters refer to the fact that the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation were cited in both the Japanese Instrument of Surrender and The Treaty of Peace between Japan and the People's Republic of China, completing the returning of sovereignty from Japan to China. Therefore the Cairo Declaration, the Postdam Proclamation, and the  subsequent Japanese Instrument of Surrender and The Peace Treaty between Japan and China should take legal supremacy over General MacArthur's orders. Even though some people interpret the 1952 Treaty of Taipei as indirectly suggesting that Japan recognized the ROC government's sovereignty over Taiwan, Penghu, and "territories which are now, or which may hereafter be, under the control of its Government," Japan abrogated this treaty upon establishment of diplomatic relations with the PRC in 1972 by acknowledging the PRC's claim that Taiwan is part of China.<br/>+<br/>+Although the interpretation of the peace treaties was used to challenge the legitimacy of the ROC on Taiwan before the 1990s, the introduction of popular elections in Taiwan has compromised this position. Except for the most extreme Taiwan independence supporters, most Taiwanese support the [[popular sovereignty]] theory and no longer see much conflict between this theory of sovereignty and the ROC position. In this sense, the ROC government currently administrating Taiwan is not the same ROC which accepted Japanese surrender because the ruling authorities were given [[mandate|popular mandate]] by different pools of constituencies: one is the mainland Chinese electorate, the other is the Taiwanese constituencies. In fact, current president Chen Shui-bian has been frequently emphasizing the popular sovereignty theory in his speeches.  <br/>+<br/>+[[Image:The Taiwan State.jpg|thumb|300px|A shopping bag produced by an independence-leaning pastry establishment. The address uses "Taiwan Country/State" rather than "Taiwan Province" or "Republic of China."]]<br/>+<br/>+However, [[as of 2005]], the conflict between these two theories still plays a role in internal Taiwanese politics. The popular sovereignty theory, which the [[pan-green coalition]] emphasizes, suggests that Taiwan could make fundamental constitutional changes by means of a popular referendum. The ROC legal theory, which is supported by the [[pan-blue coalition]], suggests that any fundamental constitutional changes would require that the amendment procedure of the ROC constitution be followed.<br/>+<br/>+== Position of the People's Republic of China (PRC) ==<br/>+<br/>+The position of the PRC is that the ROC ceased to be a legitimate government upon the founding of the former on [[October 1]], [[1949]] and that the PRC is the successor government of the ROC as the sole legitimate government of [[China]], with the right to rule Taiwan under the [[succession of states theory]]. Whether the ROC, on the other hand, still has the legitimacy to retake the mainland is not widely accepted, but disputed.<br/>+<br/>+The ROC argues that it maintains all the characteristics of a state and that it was not "replaced" or "succeeded" by the PRC because it has continued to exist long after the PRC's founding. According to the [[Montevideo Convention]] of [[1933]], the most cited source for the definition of statehood, a state must possess a permanent population, a defined territory, a government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other states. The ROC claims to meet all these criteria as it possesses a sovereign government exercising effective jurisdiction over well-defined territories with over 23 million permanent residents and a full fledged foreign ministry. <br/>+<br/>+The Unification supporters in Mainland China argue that the ROC and PRC are two different factions in the Chinese Civil War, which never legally ended. Therefore both factions belong to the same sovereign country—China. Since Taiwan's sovereignty belongs to China, the secession of Taiwan should be agreed upon by 1.3 billion Chinese citizens instead of the 23 million residents who currently live on Taiwan. Furthermore, given the UN General Assembly Resolution 2758, which states "Recognizing that the representatives of the Government of the People's Republic of China are the only lawful representatives of China to the United Nations", the PRC is formally granted the sovereignty of all of China, including Taiwan. Therefore, based on the PRC's sovereignty claim on Taiwan, it is well within the legal rights of the People's Republic of China to extend its jurisdiction to Taiwan, by military means if necessary.<br/>+<br/>+However, the PRC argues that the ROC does not meet the fourth criterion of the Montevideo Convention, as it is recognized by only 25 (relatively small and poor) countries and has been denied access to international organizations such as the UN. The ROC counters that the pressure the PRC exerts prevents the ROC from being widely recognized and that Article 3 of the same Montevideo Convention specifically says, "The political existence of the state is independent of recognition by other states." This was accomplished because the PRC took many coercive steps to isolate the ROC diplomatically. Nevertheless, the Unification supporters point out the fact that the [[Montevideo Convention]] was only signed by 19 states at the Seventh International Conference of American States. Thus the authority of the [[United Nations]] as well as UN Resolutions should supersede the [[Montevideo Convention]].<br/>+<br/>+The current position of the [[People's Republic of China]] is that "the Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government of China, and Taiwan is an inalienable part of [[China]]".  The PRC is unwilling to negotiate with the ROC under any other formulation than a [[one China policy]], but has been willing to allow the meaning of "one China" to remain ambiguous. The PRC government considers perceived violations of its One-China Policy, or inconsistencies such as supplying the ROC with arms, a violation of its rights to [[territorial integrity]]. International news organizations often report that "China considers Taiwan a renegade province that must be united with the mainland by force if necessary", even though the PRC does not explicitly say that Taiwan is a renegade province. However official PRC media outlets and officials often refer to Taiwan as "China's [[Taiwan Province]]". (The PRC claims [[Quemoy]], [[Wuchiu]] and [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]] as part of its [[Fujian|Fujian Province]], and the South China Sea Islands part of its [[Guangdong]] and [[Hainan]] provinces.)<br/>+<br/>+== Position of the Republic of China (ROC) ==<br/>+<br/>+The position of the [[Republic of China]] has always been that it is a ''[[de jure]]'' sovereign state.  The ROC government under authoritarian [[Kuomintang]] rule actively maintained that it was the sole legitimate government of China, until [[1991]], when [[President of the Republic of China|President]] [[Lee Teng-hui]] claimed that the government would no longer challenge the rule of the Communists on the mainland.  However, the now defunct [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]] never officially changed the national borders, as China claims this would be "a precursor to Taiwan independence".  The task of changing the national borders now requires a constitutional amendment passed by the [[Legislative Yuan]] and ratified by an absolute majority of all eligible ROC voters.<br/>+<br/>+On the other hand, though the [[constitution of the Republic of China]] promulgated in [[1946]] does not state exactly what territory it includes, the draft of the constitution of [[1925]] did individually list the provinces of the Republic of China and Taiwan was not among them, since Taiwan was ''de jure'' part of Japan as the result of the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] of 1895. The constitution also stipulated in Article I.4, that "the territory of the ROC is the original territory governed by it; unless authorized by the [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]], it cannot be altered."  However, in 1946, [[Sun Ke]], son of [[Sun Yat-Sen]] and the minister of the [[Executive Yuan]] of the ROC, reported to the National Assembly that "there are two types of territory changes: 1. renouncing territory and 2. annexing new territory.  The first example would be the independence of [[Mongolia]], and the second example would be the reclamation of [[Taiwan]]. Both would be examples of territory changes."  Japan renounced all rights to Taiwan in the [[San Francisco Treaty]] in 1951 and the [[Treaty of Taipei]] of 1952 without an explicit recipient. While the ROC continuously ruled Taiwan after the government was directed to Taiwan by the General Order No.1 to receive Japanese surrender, there has never been a meeting of the ROC National Assembly in making a territory change according to the ROC constitution, though the [[s:Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China|Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China]] have mentioned Taiwan Province. Thus, many pro-Independence advocates point out that the ROC constitution in fact denies its own legality governing Taiwan. [http://news.yam.com/tdn/politics/200502/20050215236817.html]<br/>+<br/>+The now defunct National Assembly passed constitutional amendments that give the people of the "[[Free Area of the Republic of China]]", comprised of the territories it controls, the sole right to exercise the sovereignty of the Republic through elections of the President and the entire Legislature as well as through elections to ratify amendments to the ROC constitution.  Also, Chapter I, Article 2 of the ROC constitution states that "The sovereignty of the Republic of China shall reside in the whole body of citizens."  For some, this suggests that the constitution implicitly admits that the sovereignty of the ROC is limited to the areas that it controls even if there is no constitutional amendment that explicitly spells out the ROC's borders.<br/>+<br/>+In [[1999]], President [[Lee Teng-hui]] proposed a [[two-state theory]] (or a special state-to-state relations theory, [[:zh:兩國論]]) in which both the ROC and PRC would be considered separate states with a special diplomatic, cultural and historic relationship, and gained immense support within Taiwan.  This however drew an angry reaction from the PRC who believed that Lee was covertly supporting [[Taiwan independence]].<br/>+<br/>+The current president, [[Chen Shui-bian]], believes that "Taiwan is an independent, sovereign country" but with the view that "Taiwan is the Republic of China." This is suggested in his [[Four-stage Theory of the Republic of China]]. He, however, has been deliberately silent as to the issue of whether Taiwan is or is not part of China and the meaning of the term [[China]].  Government publications have implied that Taiwan and the ROC, and China and the PRC are synonymous. Chen has so far refused to endorse the [[One China Principle]] the PRC requires for negotiations to begin. There have been thus far unsuccessful attempts to restart semi-formal negotiations through formulations that refer to the ''[[1992 Taiwan consensus|1992 consensus]]'' or the ''spirit of [[1992]]''.  After becoming chairman of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] in July 2002, Chen appeared to move toward a two states theory and in early August [[2002]], he stated that Taiwan may "go on its own Taiwanese road" and that "it is clear that the two sides of the straits are separate countries." These statements were strongly criticized by opposition parties in Taiwan.<br/>+<br/>+The position of supporters of [[Taiwan independence]] is that Taiwan is not part of [[China]] and the PRC is the sole legitimate government of China. Until the mid-[[1990s]], supporters of [[Taiwan independence]] opposed the Republic of China and supported the creation of an independent [[Republic of Taiwan]]. Since the mid-1990s, a compromise has been reached between most supporters of [[Taiwan independence]] and [[Chinese reunification]] on Taiwan to support the continuation of the Republic of China but as a government that administers only Taiwan and other islands. The [[Taiwan Solidarity Union]], the junior party within the pan-Green coalition, opposes this compromise.<br/>+<br/>+The position of supporters of [[Chinese reunification]] in Taiwan is that Taiwan is part of China but the PRC is not the sole legitimate government of China, and that reunification does not necessarily have to occur under the communist regime.  Within Taiwan, support for Taiwan independence and Chinese reunification exists as part of a political spectrum with most people in the middle.  Traditionally, reunification has more support among "mainlanders" (the descendants of those who fled the mainland after the [[Chinese civil war|civil war]]), while support for independence is rooted in the "Taiwanese" majority "ethnic" group (those who have lived on the island since before the civil war). However, both groups were reconciled because of the coercive measures that the PRC took in an effort to force reunification or annexation.<br/>+<br/>+== Position of other countries and international organizations ==<br/>+<br/>+:''See also [[Foreign relations of the Republic of China]]<br/>+<br/>+Because of anti-Communist sentiment at the start of the [[Cold War]], the Republic of China was initially recognized as the sole legitimate government of both mainland China and Taiwan by the [[United Nations]] and most Western nations. The [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 505]] passed on [[1 February]] [[1952]] has considered the Chinese Communists rebels against the Republic of China. However, the [[1970s]] saw a switch in diplomatic recognitions from the ROC to the PRC. On [[25 October]] [[1971]], [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758|Resolution 2758]] was passed by the [[UN General Assembly]], which [[China and the United Nations|in effect expelled]] the Republic of China and replaced the China seat on the [[Security Council]] (and all other UN organs) with the People's Republic of China. It declared "that the representatives of the Government of the People's Republic of China are the only lawful representatives of China to the United Nations." Multiple attempts by the Republic of China to rejoin the UN, no longer to represent all of China but just the people of the territories it governs, have not made it past committee, largely due to diplomatic maneuvering by the PRC, which claims Resolution 2758 has settled the matter. (''See [[China and the United Nations]].'')<br/>+<br/>+The PRC refuses to maintain diplomatic relations with any nation that recognizes the ROC, but does not object to nations conducting economic, cultural, and other such exchanges with Taiwan that do not imply diplomatic relation. Therefore, many nations that have diplomatic relations with [[Beijing]] maintain unofficial quasi-diplomatic offices in Taipei.  For example, the United States maintains the [[American Institute in Taiwan]].  Similarly, the government in Taiwan maintains quasi-diplomatic offices in most nations under various names, most commonly as the [[Taipei Economic and Cultural Office]].<br/>+<br/>+The [[United States]], [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Japan]] recognize that there is one China and that the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate government of China.  However, the U.S. and Japan ''acknowledge'' rather than ''recognize'' the PRC position that Taiwan is part of China.  In the case of Canada and the UK, the bilateral written agreement stated that the two respective parties ''take note'' of Beijing's position, but the word ''support'' was also not used. The UK government position has been stated several times that "the future of Taiwan be decided peacefully by the peoples of both sides of the Strait." Although the media in the PRC claim that the United States opposes Taiwanese independence, the United States takes advantage of the subtle difference between "oppose" and "does not support". In fact, a substantial majority of the statements Washington has made says that it "does not support Taiwanese independence", not "opposes". Thus, the US currently does not take a position on the political outcome except for one explicit condition that there be a peaceful resolution to the differences between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.  All of this ambiguity has resulted in the United States constantly walking on a diplomatic tightrope with regard to the China/Taiwan issue. <br/>+<br/>+The ROC maintains formal diplomatic relations with 25 countries, mostly in Central America and Africa.  Interestingly, the [[Holy See]] also recognizes the ROC, a largely non-[[Christianity|Christian]]/[[Catholic]] state, mainly out of protest of the PRC's [[Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association|suppression of the Catholic faith]] on the mainland. Vatican City has repeatedly stated its intention to break relations with Taiwan as soon as the PRC grants more religious liberty. During the [[1990s]], there was a diplomatic tug of war in which the PRC and ROC would attempt to outbid each other for diplomatic support of small nations.  However, by 2001, this effort seems to have ended as a result of the PRC's growing economic power and doubts on Taiwan as to whether this aid was actually in the Republic of China's interest.  In [[March 2004]],  [[Dominica]] switched recognition to the PRC, in exchange for a large package of aid. However, in late 2004, [[Vanuatu]] briefly switched recognition from Beijing to Taipei, leading to the ousting of its Prime Minister and a return to its recognition of Beijing. On [[January 20]], [[2005]], [[Grenada]] switched its recognition from Taipei to Beijing, in return for millions of dollars of aid (US$1,500 for every Grenadan).  On [[October 26]], [[2005]], [[Senegal]] also broke off relations with the Republic of China and established diplomatic contacts in Beijing.<br/>+<br/>+Currently, the countries who maintain formal diplomatic relations with the ROC include:<br/>+<br/>+{|width=100% style="background:transparent"<br/>+|-width=50% valign=top<br/>+|<br/>+* {{BLZ}} (1989)<br/>+* {{BFA}} (1994)<br/>+* {{TCD}} (1997)<br/>+* {{CRI}} (1959)<br/>+* {{DOM}} (1957)<br/>+* {{SLV}} (1961)<br/>+* {{GMB}} (1995)<br/>+* {{GTM}} (1960)<br/>+* {{HTI}} (1956)<br/>+* {{VAT}} (The [[Holy See]]) (1942)<br/>+* {{HND}} (1965)<br/>+* {{KIR}} (2003)<br/>+* {{MWI}} (1966)<br/>+|<br/>+* {{MHL}} (1998)<br/>+* {{NRU}} (1980, 2005)<br/>+* {{NIC}} (1990)<br/>+* {{PLW}} (1999)<br/>+* {{PAN}} (1954)<br/>+* {{PRY}} (1957)<br/>+* {{KNA}} (1983)<br/>+* {{VCT}} (1981)<br/>+* {{STP}} (1997)<br/>+* {{SWZ}} (1968)<br/>+* {{SLB}} (1983)<br/>+* {{TUV}} (1979)<br/>+|}<br/>+<br/>+[[Image:WBC-TVCM-ORIGINAL.JPG|thumb|300px|The political status of the Republic of China often leads to complicated situations.

Their flag was prominently absent from the Tournament's logo, instead stretching the [[Italy|Italian]] flag to double length to cover the entire background (top middle)]]<br/>+<br/>+Under continuing pressure from the PRC to bar any representation of the ROC that may imply statehood, international organizations have different policies toward the issue of Taiwan's participation. In cases (such as the UN and the [[World Health Organization]] under it) where almost all UN members or sovereign states participate, the ROC has been completely shut out while in others, such as the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) and [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) the ROC participates under unusual names: "[[Chinese Taipei]]" in the case of [[APEC]] and the IOC, and the "Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kimmen and Matsu" (often shortened as "Chinese Taipei") in the case of the WTO. The issue of Taiwan's name came under scrutiny during the 2006 World Baseball Classic. The organizers of the 16-team tournament intended to call Taiwan as such, but reverted to "Chinese Taipei" under pressure from China. The Taiwanese protested the decision, claiming that the WBC is not an IOC event, but did not prevail. The [[ISO 3166]] directory of names of countries and territories registers Taiwan (TW) separately from and in addition to the People's Republic of China (CN), but lists Taiwan as "Taiwan, Province of China" based on the name used by the UN with PRC pressure. In [[ISO 3166-2:CN]], Taiwan is also coded CN-71 under China, thus making Taiwan part of China in [[ISO 3166-1]] and [[ISO 3166-2]].<br/>+<br/>+Naming of the ROC and Taiwan continues to be a contentious issue in non-governmental organizations. One organization which faced a huge controversy in this respect was the [[Lions Club]].<br/>+<br/>+== Slips of the tongue ==<br/>+<br/>+Many political leaders who have maintained some form of One-China Policy have committed slips of the tongue in referring Taiwan as a country or as the Republic of China.  Presidents [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George W. Bush]] have been known to have referred to Taiwan as a country during their terms of office.  Although near the end of his term as [[U.S. Secretary of State]], [[Colin Powell]] unintentionally said that Taiwan is not a state, he referred to Taiwan as the Republic of China twice during a testimony to the [[U.S. Senate]] Foreign Relations Committee on [[March 9]], [[2001]] ([http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2001/03/15/77594 ''Taipei Times''; March 15, 2001]).  In the PRC Premier [[Zhu Rongji]]'s farewell speech to the [[National People's Congress]], Zhu accidentally referred to Mainland China and Taiwan as two countries ([http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2003/03/06/196950 ''Taipei Times''; March 6, 2003]).  There are also those from the PRC who informally refer to Taiwan as a country ([http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4153594.stm Caroline Gluck; BBC News; August 17, 2005]). Most recently, US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld stated in a local Chinese newspaper in California in July 2005 that Taiwan is "a sovereign nation". However, China discovered the statement about three months after it was made.<br/>+<br/>+In a controversial speech on February 4, 2006, Japanese Foreign Minster [[Taro Aso]] called Taiwan a country with very high education levels because of previous Japanese colonial rule over the island ([http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2006/02/06/2003291777 ''Taipei Times'', February 6, 2006]).  One month later, he told a Japanese parliamentary committee that "[Taiwan's] democracy is considerably matured and liberal economics is deeply ingrained, so it is a law-abiding country.  In various ways, it is a country that shares a sense of values with Japan."  At the same time, he admitted that "I know there will be a problem with calling [Taiwan] a country" ([http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2006/03/10/2003296575 ''Taipei Times'', March 10, 2006]).  Later, the Japanese Foreign Ministry tried to downplay or reinterpret his remarks.<br/>+<br/>+== Possible military solutions and intervention ==<br/>+<br/>+Until 1979, both sides intended to resolve the conflict militarily.  [[Chinese Civil War#The War after 1949|Intermittent clashes]] occurred throughout the 1950s and 1960s, with escalations comprising the [[First Taiwan Strait crisis|First]] and [[Second Taiwan Strait crisis|Second Taiwan Strait crises]]. In [[1979]], with the U.S. change of diplomatic recognition to the PRC, the ROC lost its ally needed to "recover the mainland." Meanwhile, the PRC's desire to be accepted in the international community led it to promote peaceful unification under what would later be termed "[[one country, two systems]]," rather than to "liberate Taiwan" and institute [[socialism]] (in other words, to make Taiwan a [[Special Administrative Region]]).<br/>+<br/>+=== PRC's condition on military intervention ===<br/>+<br/>+Notwithstanding, the PRC government has issued triggers for an immediate war with Taiwan. These conditions are:<br/>+* if events occur leading to the ''separation'' of Taiwan from China ''in any name'', or <br/>+* if Taiwan is ''invaded and occupied'' by foreign countries, or <br/>+* if Taiwan refuses reunification negotiations ''indefinitely''.<br/>+<br/>+Much saber-rattling by the mainland has been done over this, with [[Jiang Zemin]], after assuming the mantle of the Chairman of the Central Military Commission, becoming a leading voice.<br/>+<br/>+The third condition has especially caused a stir in Taiwan as the term "indefinitely" is open to interpretation. It has also been viewed by some as meaning that preserving the ambiguous status quo is not acceptable to the PRC, although the PRC stated on many occasions that there is no explicit timetable for reunification.<br/>+<br/>+Concern over a formal declaration of ''de jure'' [[Taiwanese independence]] is a strong impetus for the military buildup between Taiwan and mainland China.  Some people believe that Taiwan will attempt a declaration of independence during the [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Olympic Games]] in Beijing.  Others point out that the current US administration has publicly declared that given the status quo, it would not aid Taiwan if it were to declare independence unilaterally.<br/>+<br/>+According to ROC President [[Chen Shui-bian]], China has accelerated the deployment of missiles against Taiwan to 120 a year, bringing the total arsenal to 706 ballistic missiles capable of being fitted with nuclear warheads that are aimed at Taiwan. These missiles are believed to have a CEP (Circular Error Probability) of more than 100 meters, which implies they could do little damage in a likely conventional war scenario because of poor accuracy. Some believe that their deployment is a political tool on the part of the PRC to increase political pressure on Taiwan to abandon unilateral moves toward formal independence, at least for the time being.<br/>+<br/>+=== Balance of power ===<br/>+<br/>+The possibility of war, the close geographical proximity of [[Republic of China|ROC]]-controlled Taiwan and [[People's Republic of China|PRC]]-controlled mainland China, and the resulting flare-ups that occur every few years, conspire to make this one of the most watched focal points in the Pacific. Both sides have chosen to have a strong naval presence.  However, naval strategies between both powers greatly shifted in the 1980s and 1990s, when the PRC assumed a more aggressive posture by building landing craft, and Taiwan adopted a more defensive attitude by building and buying frigates and missile destroyers.  <br/>+<br/>+The [[People's Liberation Army Air Force|PRC's air force]] is considered large and powerful, although it is not yet capable of controlling Taiwan's airspace in the event of a conflict.  The ROC's airforce relies on Taiwan's second generation fighters. The ROC has approximately 150 US-built [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16s]], approximately 60 French-built [[Dassault-Breguet Mirage 2000|Mirage 2000-5s]], and approximately 130 locally developed [[AIDC Ching-kuo|IDFs]] (Indigenous Defence Fighters). All of these ROC fighter jets are able to conduct BVR (Beyond Visual Range) combat missions with respective BVR missiles, while only a handful of PRC fighter airplanes are able to conduct such tasks.<br/>+<br/>+In [[2003]], the ROC made a purchase of four missile destroyers—the former [[USS Kidd (DDG-993)|USS ''Kidd'']] and three sister ships, and expressed a strong interest in the [[Arleigh Burke class destroyer|''Arleigh Burke'' class]].  But with the growth of the PRC [[People's Liberation Army Navy|navy]] and [[PLAAF|air force]], some doubt that the ROC could withstand a determined invasion from mainland China in the future. This also leads to a view that Taiwanese independence, if it is to be implemented, should be attempted as early as possible while the ROC still had the capacity for an all-out military conflict. Over the last three decades, estimates of how long Taiwan can withstand a full scale invasion from across the Strait without any outside help have [http://www.spacewar.com/2004/040811075029.onla5r7o.html] decreased from three months to only six days.  And given that most estimates in the US show that any optimistic timeframe for a full scale US rescue would take at least two weeks, the current conditions do not look favorably upon Taiwan.<br/>+<br/>+Numerous reports issued by the PRC, ROC, and US militaries make wildly mutually contradictory statements about the possible defense of Taiwan.<br/>+<br/>+Naturally, the possible war is not being planned in a vacuum.  In [[1979]], the [[Congress of the United States|United States Congress]] passed the [[Taiwan Relations Act]], a law generally interpreted as mandating U.S. defense of Taiwan in the event of an attack from the Chinese Mainland (the Act is applied to Taiwan and the Pescadores, but not to Quemoy and Matsu).  The United States maintains the world's largest permanent fleet in the Pacific Region near Taiwan. The [[Seventh Fleet]], operating primarily out of various bases in Japan, is a powerful naval contingent built upon the world's only permanently forward-deployed aircraft carrier [[USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63)|USS ''Kitty Hawk'']]. Although the stated purpose of the fleet is not Taiwanese defense, it is safely assumed from past actions that that is one of the reasons why the fleet is stationed in those waters.<br/>+<br/>+Since [[2000]], Japan renewed its defense obligations with the US and also embarked on a rearmament program, partly in response to fears that Taiwan would be invaded. Some analysts believed that the PRC could launch [[pre-emptive]] strikes on military bases in Japan to deter US and Japanese forces from coming to Taiwan's aid. Japanese strategic planners also see an independent Taiwan as vital, not only because Taiwan controls valuable shipping routes, but its capture by China would make Japan more vulnerable. Historically, in [[World War Two]], although the US captured the [[Philippines]], another viable target would have been Taiwan (then known as [[Formosa]]) as that would enable a direct attack on Japan. However, critics assert that the PRC would not wish to give Japan and the US such an excuse to intervene.<br/>+<br/>+=== Third Taiwan Strait Crisis ===<br/>+<br/>+[[Image:ROCN kang ding class.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Republic of China Navy|ROCS]] ''Kang Ding''-class frigate with S-70C helicopter]]<!--ROCS=Republic of China Ship, USS=United States Ship, etc.--><br/>+In 1996, the PRC began conducting [[Third Taiwan Strait Crisis|military exercises near Taiwan]], and launched several ballistic missiles over the island.  The saber-rattling was done in response to the possible re-election of President [[Lee Teng-hui]], who had promoted a controversial "two states" theory for cross-strait relations.  The United States, under then President Clinton, sent two aircraft carrier battle groups to the region, sailing them into the Taiwan Strait. The PRC, unable to track the ships' movements, and probably unwilling to escalate the conflict, quickly backed down. The event had little impact on the outcome of the election, since none of Lee's contestants were strong enough to defeat him, but it is widely believed that the PRC's aggressive acts had, far from intimidating the Taiwanese population, given Lee the boost that pushed his share of votes over 50 percent.<br/>+<br/>+The possibility of war in the Taiwan Straits, even though quite low in the short-term, requires the PRC, ROC, and U.S. to remain wary and vigilant. The goal of the three parties at the moment seems to be, for the most part, to maintain the status quo.<br/>+<br/>+== Recent developments & future prospects ==<br/>+=== Political ===<br/>+<br/>+Although the situation is confusing, most observers believe that it is stable with enough understandings and [[gentlemen's agreement]]s to keep things from breaking out into open warfare.  The current controversy is over the term ''one China'', as the PRC insists that the ROC must recognize this term to begin negotiations.  Although the ruling [[Democratic Progressive Party]] has moderated its support for [[Taiwan independence]], there is still insufficient support within that party for President Chen Shui-bian to agree to one China.  By contrast, the opposition [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) and [[People First Party]] (PFP) appear willing to agree to some variation of one China, and observers believed the position of the PRC was designed to sideline Chen until the [[ROC presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]] where it was hoped that someone who was more supportive of [[Chinese reunification]] would come to power.  Partly to counter this, Chen Shui-bian announced in July 2002 that if the PRC does not respond to Taiwan's goodwill, Taiwan may "go on its own ... road." <br/>+<br/>+With Chen's re-election in 2004, Beijing's prospects for a speedier resolution were dampened, though they seemed strengthened again following the Pan-Blue majority in the [[ROC legislative election, 2004|2004 legislative elections]]. However, public opinion in Taiwan reacted unfavorably towards the [[Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China|anti-secession law]] passed by the PRC in March 2005. Following two high profile visits by KMT and PFP party leaders to the PRC, the balance of public opinion appears to be ambiguous, with the Pan-Green Coalition gaining a majority in the [[ROC National Assembly election, 2005|2005 National Assembly elections]], but the Pan-Blue Coalition scoring a landslide victory in the 2005 municipal elections.<br/>+<br/>+=== Public opinion ===<br/>+<br/>+Public opinion in Taiwan regarding relations with the PRC is notoriously difficult to gauge, as poll results tend to be extremely sensitive to how the questions are phrased and what options are given, and there is a tendency by all political parties to [[spin (politics)|spin]] the results to support their point of view. There is general agreement that Beijing's [[one country, two systems]] policy is unacceptable when unilaterally applied to Taiwan; however, public opinion regarding Taiwan's ultimate fate is somewhat more complicated.<br/>+<br/>+When given a choice between the three options of independence, unification or status quo, typical results of recent polls show 20 percent in favor of independence, 15 percent in favor of unification and about 50 percent in favor of continuing the status quo. However, there is also between 70-80 percent support for the view that Taiwan is an independent nation under the name of Republic of China with a special relationship to the People's Republic of China, as set forth by former President Lee. The dependence of poll results on wording is illustrated by the results of one recent poll. 72 percent polled said they would fight to defend the country from a communist invasion.  However, when the question was rephrased asking whether they would fight if Taiwan declared independence, the number of affirmative responses decreased to 68 percent [http://www.cna.tv/stories/taiwan/view/25594/1/gb/.html]. There is also a rise in pragmatists who would support either unification or independence based on the situation. A recent poll in [[December 2004]] shows, given a referendum vote on independence, unification or becoming a state of the U.S., 41 percent of Taiwanese residents support independence, 24 percent choose unification and 15 percent would be in favor of becoming a [[51st state]] of the United States. 80 percent of the population opposed the PRC's favoured "One China - Two Systems" unification proposal after the anti-secession law was passed. [http://www.tvbs.com.tw/FILE_DB/DL_DB/chunruh/200412/chunruh-20041224104727.pdf]<br/>+<br/>+=== Changing Taiwan’s status with respect to the ROC constitution ===<br/>+<br/>+From the perspective of the [[Constitution of the Republic of China|ROC constitution]], which the mainstream political parties such as the [[Kuomintang|KMT]] and [[Democratic Progressive Party|DPP]] currently respect and recognize, changing the ROC’s governing status or completely clarifying Taiwan’s political status would at best require amending the ROC constitution.  In other words, if reunification supporters wanted to reunify Taiwan with the mainland in such a way that would effectively abolish the ROC or affect the ROC’s sovereignty, or if independence supporters wanted to abolish the ROC and establish a Republic of Taiwan, they would need to amend the ROC constitution.  Passing an amendment requires an unusually broad political consensus, which includes approval from three-quarters of a quorum of members of the Legislative Yuan.  This quorum requires at least three-quarters of all members of the Legislature.  After passing the legislature, the amendments need ratification from at least fifty percent of all eligible voters of the ROC, ''irrespective'' of voter turnout.<br/>+<br/>+Given these harsh constitutional requirements, neither the pan-greens nor pan-blues can unilaterally change Taiwan’s political and legal status with respect to the ROC’s constitution.  However, extreme Taiwan independence supporters view the ROC’s constitution as illegal and therefore believe that amendments to the ROC constitution are an invalid way to change Taiwan’s political status.<br/>+<br/>+== Note on terminology ==<br/>+<br/>+Some scholarly sources as well as political entities like the PRC refer to Taiwan's controversial status as the "Taiwan question", "Taiwan issue", or "Taiwan problem", all which can be translated in Chinese as 臺灣問題/台湾问题.  The ROC government does not like these terminologies, emphasizing that it should be called the "Mainland issue", "Mainland question", or the "Mainland problem" because from the ROC's point of view, the PRC is making an issue out of or creating a problem out of Taiwan.  To avoid siding with any viewpoint on whose issue or problem this is, this article uses the neutral term "Political status of Taiwan".<br/>+<br/>+== See also ==<br/>+<br/>+* [[228 Incident]], for historical context of ROC-Taiwanese conflict <br/>+* [[Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China]]<br/>+* [[China and the United Nations]]<br/>+* [[Chinese Civil War]], for historical context of the ROC-PRC conflict<br/>+* [[Chinese reunification]]<br/>+* [[Foreign relations of the Republic of China]]<br/>+* [[Four-stage Theory of the Republic of China]]<br/>+* [[Legal status of Taiwan]]<br/>+* [[Politics of the Republic of China]]<br/>+* [[Mainland Affairs Council]] of the ROC<br/>+* [[National Unification Council]] of the ROC<br/>+* [[Taiwan Affairs Office]] of the PRC<br/>+* [[Taiwan independence]]<br/>+<br/>+== External links ==<br/>+<br/>+{{Wikisourcepar|US-PRC Joint Communique}}<br/>+<br/>+* [http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/rp/2000-01/01rp15.htm Australian White Paper on Taiwan relations]<br/>+* [http://newton.uor.edu/Departments&Programs/AsianStudiesDept/china-taiwan.html Cross-Strait Relations between China and Taiwan] collection of documents and articles.<br/>+* [http://www.gwytb.gov.cn:8088/detail.asp?table=WhitePaper&title=White%20Papers%20On%20Taiwan%20Issue&m_id=4 PRC Government White Paper: The One-China Principle and the Taiwan Issue]<br/>+* [http://www.taiwandocuments.org/ Taiwan Documents Project]<br/>+* [http://www.mac.gov.tw/english/index1-e.htm Taiwan Mainland Affairs Council]<br/>+* [http://www.taiwanadvice.com/harintmcexc.htm Questions of Sovereignty -- the Montevideo Convention and Territorial Cession] Comprehensive overview of Taiwan's presumed qualifying criteria for statehood under the Montevideo Convention, by Richard W.

The head should be carried well up and the tail carried over the back, without signs of fear or nervousness.  The Bluetick coat should be moderately coarse and glossy.  The Bluetick Coonhound gets its "blue" coloring from black/white mottling which gives the impression of a navy blue color.  This mottling covers the body and can be interspersed with variously-shaped black spots on the back, ears and sides. Preference runs to more blue than black on the body. Black should predominate on the head and ears. Bluetick Coonhounds should have tan dots over the eyes and on the cheeks with dark red ticking on the feet and lower legs below the body line, on the chest, and below the tail. Red can be eliminated, as well as the tan head coloring. Blue mottling on the body is preferred to lighter ticking. Blue ticking should be predominant over white in the body coat. Off colors are not allowed.<br/> <br/>-==Sources==<br/>-*[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/arcus.html Platner]<br/>-*[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]] VI.1106<br/>-*[http://www.livius.org/a/italy/rome/arch_gallienus/arch_gallienus.html Livius Picture archive]<br/>+The Bluetick Coonhound has a broad head with low set ears which reach at least to the nose.  The muzzle should be square, not narrow or snipey, and slightly shorter than the depth of skull.  There should be a prominent stop, and the skull should be slightly domed.  The lips and flews should well cover the lower jaw.  The blueticks eyes should be large and set wide apart.  Coloring light brown to dark brown, with a close fitting eylid.  The neck of the Bluetick should be arched and muscular, of moderate length and without excessive dewflap.<br/>+<br/>+Male coonhounds should be 22 to 27 inches at the shoulder and weigh approximately 55 to 80 pounds.  Females are considerably smaller, being 21 to 25 inches at the shoulder and weighing between 45 to 65 pounds.  The body should be higher at the shoulder than the hips, and when measured from the withers to the base of tail it should be slightly longer than tall. Blueticks (as they are known by fanciers) should have a deep chest with well sprung ribs, curving into the belly rather than having an extreme tucked up look.<br/>+<br/>+Feet should be cat-like, rounded with well-arched toes.  Rear legs should have a moderate bend at the hocks.  All legs should be straight when viewed from the front or rear.<br/>+<br/>+== Temperament ==<br/> <br/> <br/>-[[Category:3rd century establishments]]<br/>-[[Category:Ancient Roman triumphal arches in Rome|Gallienus]]<br/>-{{Ancient-Rome-stub}}<br/>+Blue-Tick hounds are a friendly breed, but new owners should be warned they can be particularly challenging to train.  They are, like their hound counterparts very intelligent breeds, with an uncanny knack for problem-solving.  This can be particuarly problematic if they are confined to a household or to a small yard, and it should be noted to give this breed plenty of space.  Once trained, the breed is very mindful of its owner.  Breed will drool occassionally and salivate heavily when exposed to "human" foods.  Blue-Ticks should not be raised with members of the same litter.  They are very loud, constant, and howling barkers.<br/> <br/>-[[fr:Arcs_de_Rome#Arc de Gallien (Arcus Gallieni)]]<br/>-[[it:Archi_antichi_di_Roma#Arco_di_Gallieno]]<br/>-[[nl:Boog van Gallienus]]<br/>+In normal conditions the dog is excellent around families and children.  Often mistaken for aggressiveness, the breed will "greet" strangers with it's signature howl and will literally "sniff" the subject until satisfied.  Blue-Ticks are driven by their strong sense of smell and make excellent hunting/tracking dogs.<br/>+<br/>+== Miscellaneous ==<br/>+A Bluetick Coonhound named [[Smokey (mascot)|"Smokey"]] is the official athletic [[mascot]] of the [[University of Tennessee]].<br/>+<br/>+A Bluetick Coonhound named [[Tet]] was the companion of [[Stringfellow Hawke]], the main character of popular 1980's television show [[Airwolf]].<br/>+<br/>+[[Category:Dog breeds]]<br/>+[[Category:Scent hounds]]<br/>+<br/>+[[de:Bluetick Coonhound]]</td>

According to the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'', "Happy Birthday to You" is the most popular song in the [[English language]], followed by "[[For He's A Jolly Good Fellow]]" and "[[Auld Lang Syne]]". The song has been translated into many languages, though it is often sung with the English lyrics in countries where English is not a primary language.  It's also the most frequently sung song in [[America]].<br/>-<br/>-The melody of "Happy Birthday to You" was written by [[United States|American]] sisters [[Patty Hill|Patty]] and [[Mildred Hill]] in [[1893]] when they were school teachers in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. The verse was originally intended as a classroom greeting entitled "'''Good Morning to All'''". The version as we know it was copyrighted in [[1935]] by the Summy Company as an arrangement by Preston Ware Orem, and is scheduled to expire in [[2030]]. This was the first copyrighted version to include the lyrics. The company holding the copyright was purchased by Warner Chappell in [[1990]] for $15 million dollars, with the value of "Happy Birthday" estimated at $5 million. [http://www.princetoninfo.com/200303/30326p04.html#%60Happy%20Birthday'%20Connection]  While the current copyright status of the song is unclear, Warner claims that unauthorized public performances of the song are technically [[illegal]] unless royalties are paid to them. It is not completely certain who wrote the lyrics to "Happy Birthday to You".<br/>-<br/>-During the [[SARS]] outbreak in [[Hong Kong]] in [[2003]], the government advised people to regularly wash their hands with soap for around 15 seconds. In order to make this practice more easily handled by kids, some primary school and kindergarten teachers told their students to sing "Happy Birthday to You" slowly while they washed their hands, and to only stop washing after finishing the song.{{citation needed}}<br/>-<br/>-=="Good Morning to All" lyrics==<br/>-:Good morning to you,<br/>-:Good morning to you,<br/>-:Good morning, dear children,<br/>-:Good morning to all.<br/>-<br/>-=="Happy Birthday to You" lyrics==<br/>-<br/>-The traditional version of the song (the four lines beginning "Happy birthday to you...") is actually the chorus to the original. It is also a melody appearance and is to the tune of "[[Away in a Manger]]".<br/>-<br/>-Here are the lyrics in their most commonly used form:<br/>-<br/>-:Happy birthday to you,<br/>-:Happy birthday to you,<br/>-:Happy birthday dear (name),<br/>-:Happy birthday to you.<br/>-<br/>-Some add other verses to the end, sung to the same tune:<br/>-<br/>-:How old are you now,<br/>-:How old are you now,<br/>-:How old are you (name),<br/>-:How old are you now?<br/>-<br/>-:Many more may you have, <br/>-:Many more may you have,<br/>-:Many more happy birthdays,<br/>-:Many more may you have.<br/>-<br/>-The birthday boy or girl then responds:<br/>- <br/>-:I thank you dear friends,<br/>-:I thank you dear friends,<br/>-:For all your kind wishes,<br/>-:I thank you dear friends.<br/>-<br/>-And another version :<br/>-<br/>-:From old friends and true,<br/>-:From good friends and new,<br/>-:May good luck go with you,<br/>-:And happiness too.<br/>-<br/>-Some versions of the song add part or all of the following, sung to a different four-note [[motif (music)|motif]], repeated four times:<br/>-<br/>-:And many more,<br/>-:On Channel Four,<br/>-:And [[Scooby-Doo]],<br/>-:On Channel Two.<br/>-<br/>-Many alternate versions exist, most commonly sung as a joke, for example:<br/>-<br/>-:Happy birthday to you,<br/>-:You live/belong in a [[zoo]],<br/>-:You look like a [[monkey]]<br/>-:And you smell/act like one, too.<br/>-<br/>-And other versions of the above:<br/>-:Happy birthday to you,<br/>-:I went to the zoo,<br/>-:I saw a big monkey,<br/>-:And I thought it was you.<br/>-<br/>-:Happy birthday to you<br/>-:You live/belong in a zoo,<br/>-:You look like a goat<br/>-:And you chew like one, too<br/>-<br/>-Some versions, presumably in contrast to the traditional [[birthday cake]] threaten the celebrant with unpleasant foodstuffs:<br/>-<br/>-:Happy birthday to you<br/>-:Squashed tomatoes and stew<br/>-:Bread and butter in the gutter<br/>-:Happy birthday to you<br/>-<br/>-[[Marilyn Monroe]] sang a version of "Happy Birthday to you" entitled "[[Happy Birthday, Mr. President]]" to then-[[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]].<br/>-<br/>-== "Happy Birthday to You" copyright status ==<br/>-There is a [[1935]] [[copyright registration]] for "Happy Birthday to You", as a work for hire by Preston Ware Orem for the Summy Company (the publisher of "Good Morning to All"). "Good Morning to All", however, was published in 1893 and is [[public domain]] by U.S. statute. The current owner of the 1935 copyright believes that one cannot sing "Happy Birthday to You" lyrics for profit without paying [[royalties]].  Except for the splitting of the first note in the melody "Good Morning to All" to accommodate the two syllables in the word happy, melodically "Happy Birthday to You" and "Good Morning to All" are identical.<br/>-<br/>-"Good Morning to All" is printed in ''Song Stories for the [[Kindergarten]]'', published 1893 (revised edition published [[1896]]).  It credited Patty Hill for the lyrics and Mildred Hill for the music.<br/>-<br/>-Neither the words nor the music of "Good Morning to All" are copyrighted under U.S. federal statute.<br/>-<br/>-In [[1924]], Robert Coleman included "Good Morning to All" in a songbook with the birthday lyrics as a second verse.  Coleman also published "Happy Birthday" in ''The American Hymnal'' in [[1933]].  ''Children's [[Praise]] and [[Worship]]'', edited by Andrew Byers, Bessie L. Byrum and Anna E. Koglin, published the song in [[1928]].<br/>-<br/>-Later the "Happy Birthday to You" lyrics combined with the Hills' published melody showed up on stage. The [[Broadway musical]] ''[[The Band Wagon]]'' used "Happy Birthday to You" in [[1931]].  There was no copyright for the Happy Birthday lyrics at the time. Contrary to what is often erroneously reported, the lawsuit was dropped, and there was no outcome to the case. As a result, the Summy Company registered the copyright for Happy Birthday to You, which does not affect today's public domain status of "Good Morning to All." <!-- (see the ''New York Times'' of [[August 15]], [[1934]], p. 19 col. 6) --><br/>-<br/>-Precedent (regarding works derived from public domain material, and cases comparing two similar musical works) seems to suggest that the melody used in "Happy Birthday to You" would not merit additional [[legal protection]] for one split note.<br/>-<br/>-Whether or not changing the words "good morning" to "happy birthday" should be protected by copyright is a different matter. The words "good morning" were substituted with "happy birthday" by others than the authors of "Good Morning to All".<br/>-<br/>-An interesting earlier songbook is [http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/aitch/songs/songs.html ''The Golden Book of Favorite Songs''] (Chicago: Hall & McCreary, 1915). It includes the song "Good Morning to All" printed with the alternate title: "Happy Birthday to You."  However, the "Happy Birthday to You" lyrics are not actually printed along the staff.<br/>-<br/>-Regardless of the fact that "Happy Birthday to You" infringed upon ''Good Morning to All'', there is one theory that because the "Happy Birthday to You" variation was not authored by the Hills, and it was published without notice of copyright under the 1909 U. S. copyright act, that the 1935 registration is invalid.<br/>-<br/>-==Copyright issues and public performances==<br/>-<br/>-In [[1955]], [[Igor Stravinsky]] arranged a variation of the song, called ''Greeting Prelude'', to commemorate the 80th birthday of [[Pierre Monteux]]. The [[Russia]]n-born composer wrote that he had been introduced to the tune only five years earlier, when members of an orchestra with whom he was rehearsing, to his bafflement at the time, played the tune in honor of a recent birth among the orchestra members.<br/>-<br/>-One of the most famous performances of "Happy Birthday to You" was [[Marilyn Monroe]]'s [[Happy Birthday, Mr. President|rendition]] to [[U.S. President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] in May [[1962]].<br/>-<br/>-The song was also sung by the crew of [[Apollo IX]] on [[March 8]], [[1969]], perhaps qualifying as the first song sung in space.<br/>-<br/>-Many restaurants have original [[corporate]]-developed songs that are used instead of the old-fashioned "Happy Birthday to You" when serving patrons with the traditional cake on their birthday. Originally, these were specifically developed to prevent [[copyright infringement]] and having to pay [[royalties]].<br/>-<br/>-The [[BBC]] [[Cbeebies]] channel for preschool children also uses a song other than "Happy Birthday to You" to mark the birthdays of its younger viewers.<br/>-<br/>-In the ''[[Homestar Runner]]'' cartoon "[http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbsings.html Strong Bad Sings]", there is a scene where [[The Cheat (character)|The Cheat]] plays "Happy Birthday to You" on the piano while [[Strong Mad]] struggles to remember the words to the song. When the toon was released on [[DVD]], "Happy Birthday to You" had to be replaced with the [[public domain]] song "Hot Cross Buns".<br/>-<br/>-In the movie ''[[The Corporation]]'', the copyright issue itself is cited as an example demonstrating that a corporation is theoretically a [[psychopath]] if considered a living person.<br/>-<br/>-The cartoon ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'' contains a parody of the song entitled ''[[Spirit Journey Formation Anniversary]]'', performed by Aqua Teen creator Matt Malliero and [[Zakk Wylde]].<br/>-<br/>-==External links==<br/>-<br/>-* [http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/7/5/112441/6280 Kuro5hin - Exposing the Happy Birthday story]<br/>-* Sources for "Good Morning to All" sheet music:<br/>-** [http://www.easybyte.org Easybyte] <br/>-** http://www.pdinfo.com/rp/R002152.htm<br/>-** http://music.netstoreusa.com/songs/7005/HL00502604~958965.shtml<br/>-* http://mac3.a-cappella.com/shop/product_information.asp?number=2115C&aitem=1145, this page offers an MP3 sample of "Good Morning to All"<br/>-* http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.07/posts.html?pg=7, Creative Commons staff attempt to distribute a recording of the song on the web<br/>-* http://www.snopes.com/music/songs/birthday.htm, other editorials about "Happy Birthday to You"<br/>-* http://www.classicalarchives.com/encores.html, the "Classical Archives" has a "Happy Birthday to You" MIDI file with variations<br/>-* http://www.unhappybirthday.com/, comments regarding the copyright information<br/>-* [http://tealife.blogspirit.com/archive/2005/01/06/happy_birthday_in_japanese.html Happy Birthday in Japanese] (blog)<br/>-* [http://ask.yahoo.com/20060224.html Ask Yahoo!: Who wrote "Happy Birthday to You"?]<br/>-* [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/12/fashion/sundaystyles/12age.html?ex=1297400400&en=34f151b1cdb0d572&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss Don't Sing Me That Song]<br/>-<br/>-{{unreferenced}}<br/>-<br/>-[[Category:Traditional songs]]<br/>-<br/>-[[de:Happy Birthday]]<br/>-[[es:Cumpleaños feliz]]<br/>-[[pt:Parabéns pra você]]<br/>-[[sv:Happy Birthday to You]]<br/>+This is an incomplete list of '''[[Fox Broadcasting Company]] affiliates'''.

Most of the present building is the work of [[Ralph Montagu, 1st Duke of Montagu]]. Montagu was a former English ambassador to France, and Boughton House shows strong French architectural influences. His son, [[John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu]], made little alteration to the House, but made sweeping changes to the landscape and gardens after his return from campaign in Europe with his father in law, [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough]]. Following the death of George, 3rd Duke of Montagu in 1790, the house passed, through the marriage of his daughter, Elizabeth, to [[Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch]], 5th Duke of Queensberry. They were and remain a Scottish family and own several other country houses. It was little used or altered from the mid 18th century, but was well cared for. Because of this it has some of the best preserved [[baroque]] [[state room]]s in the British Isles. <br/> <br/>-The official English-language translation of this episode is called '''A Moon Star is Born'''. It was produced by [[DiC]], and aired on [[American television]] in [[1995]].<br/>-<br/>-== Plot summary ==<br/>-'''[[Usagi Tsukino]]''' is a clumsy 14-year-old schoolgirl living in Japan. She begins her day as normal; running late for [[school]]. Along the way, she runs into three little boys poking at a hurt animal. She chases the children away and discovers a [[black cat]] with a bandage on its head. She pulls the bandage off to reveal a [[crescent moon]] on the cat's forehead, but then realizes she's still late and runs off. Having failed another test, Usagi talks to her classmates [[List of minor Sailor Moon characters#Naru Osaka|Naru]] (her best friend) and [[List of minor Sailor Moon characters#Gurio Umino|Umino]] (a geeky know-it-all). They tell her about the superhero known as '''[[Sailor V]]''' who has recently been fighting crime.<br/>-<br/>-Meanwhile, the wicked '''[[Dark Kingdom#Queen Beryl|Queen Beryl]]''' is shown sitting in her throne, demanding of her shadowy minions that they find the [[Mystical Silver Crystal]], or at least gather plentiful amounts of human energy for their ruler. A man called '''[[Shitennou (Sailor Moon)#Jadeite|Jadeite]]''' approaches and asks for the task of collecting energy; Beryl agrees.<br/>-<br/>-After school, Usagi and Naru go to Naru's mother's jewelry shop, OSA-P, for a sale. Usagi finds it too crowded and expensive and decides to go home, still depressed about her test score. She crumples the paper up and throws it over her shoulder, but it hits the head of [[Mamoru Chiba|a man]] walking nearby. Calling her "''[[odango]] atama''" ("dumpling head"), he looks at the test and tells her she needs to study harder. Usagi is infuriated, tells him it's none of his business, and storms away.<br/>-<br/>-Later, having been scolded by [[List of minor Sailor Moon characters#Ikuko/Mama|her mother]] and mocked by her little brother, '''[[List of minor Sailor Moon characters#Shingo|Shingo]]''', Usagi becomes tired from all the crying. She is resting in her bedroom at home, when the cat she had saved earlier enters through the window. At first, Usagi thinks she's [[hallucinating]] when the cat begins to speak, introducing herself as '''[[Luna (Sailor Moon)|Luna]]''' and telling Usagi that she is to be a hero. She informs Usagi that an ancient organization known as the '''[[Dark Kingdom]]''' is trying to resurrect its slumbering leader by using the power of human energy. Luna gives her a brooch with a moon on it, telling her to say the words, "Moon Prism Power, Make Up!" Usagi does, and to her shock is transformed into '''Sailor Moon'''.<br/>-<br/>-For the only time in the series, Sailor Moon uses the ornaments in her hair as [[radar]]s, and is able to sense that Naru is in trouble. Meanwhile, Naru's mother has been [[spiritual possession|possessed]] by one of the Dark Kingdom's creatures--a '''youma'''. Sailor Moon arrives to stop her, but when attacked by hypnotised [[zombie]]-like people, she panics. Unable to fight properly, she is rescued by a caped man who calls himself '''[[Tuxedo Mask]]''' and tells her that crying won't help. Luna tells Sailor Moon to use her [[tiara]] on the monster. She flings the tiara at the youma and shouts "Moon Tiara Action!" The creature is destroyed.<br/>-<br/>-Tuxedo Mask tells Sailor Moon she's done well, and turns to go. She immediately finds herself in love with him. The next day, Usagi's friends try to tell her about the amazing dream they had where Sailor Moon came to rescue them, but Usagi just falls asleep on her desk.<br/>-<ref>{{cite web |url=http://soul-hunter.com/sailormoon/television/summaries/001.php  |title= Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon |accessdate= 2006-10-27 |last= Carroll |first= Elizabeth Ann }}The Oracle's episode summary</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = Doi | first = Hitoshi | authorlink = Hitoshi Doi | title = Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon episode 001 | date = 1994-05-19 | url = http://www.usagi.org/doi/smoon/episodes/sm001.html | accessdate = 2006-10-28}} </ref><br/>-<br/>-== English-language dub ==<br/>-Other than some differences in dialogue, ''A Moon Star is Born'' is mostly the same as the original episode. Usagi is introduced as '''Serena''', Naru as '''Molly''', Umino as '''Melvin''', Shingo as '''Sammy''', and Jadeite as '''Jedite''', while the Dark Kingdom is called the '''Negaverse'''. Sailor V seems to be a fictional character, and Usagi is already a fan; in the original, this is where she hears of Sailor V for the first time. The man who makes fun of Usagi's test score calls her "meatball head." Sailor Moon's transformation words are given as "Moon Prism Power," without the "Make Up" at the end, and her attack is called "Moon Tiara Magic."<br/>-<!--These name changes are only to be listed the very first time they happen. Note that Mamoru/Darien's name is not given in this episode.--><br/>-<br/>-A flashback scene is inserted at the beginning which did not exist in the original version, showing the character [[Queen Serenity]] and mentioning [[Artemis (Sailor Moon)|Artemis]]. Some special effects are added, including scene transitions, images within Beryl's crystal ball, and a glowing effect around Luna's crescent moon when her bandage is removed. Removed scenes include Usagi sticking her tongue out at the man who makes fun of her test score, being yelled at by her mother for failing the math test, and fighting with her brother afterward.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://smuncensored.com/comparison.php?episodeid=1 |title= Sailor Moon Uncensored |accessdate= 2006-10-27 |last= Wheeler |first= Robert |coauthors= Bednarski, Dan; Wood, Tiffany }} Full list of changes made for English dub</ref><br/>-<br/>-An educational segment called "Sailor Says" is added at the end.

Initially, it was thought that one of Ohio's two existing public universities ([[Ohio University]] and [[Miami University]]) would be designated as the land-grant institution, and each engaged in a vigorous competition to win over the state legislature. With the strong urging of Governor [[Rutherford B. Hayes]], however, it was ultimately decided to establish a new university to be located near the legislature in Columbus.  The school was originally situated within a farming community located on the northern edge of Columbus, and was intended to matriculate students of various agricultural and mechanical disciplines.  From its inception, a contentious debate was waged between those in favor of broadening the university's focus to encompass the liberal arts and sciences and those who favored a more limited focus.  The former ("broad-gauge") faction was led by university trustee Joseph Sullivant.  An 1873 vote passed by a narrrow 8-7 margin in favor of broadening the spectrum of educational offerings to seven fields of study: agriculture, ancient languages, chemistry, geology, mathematics, modern languages, and physics. Later that year, the university welcomed its first class of twenty-four students, including three women.  In 1878, and in light of its expanded focus, the college permanently changed its name to the now-familiar "The Ohio State University."<br/>+[[User talk:Crzrussian/Archive 1|1]], [[User talk:Crzrussian/Archive 2|2]], [[User talk:Crzrussian/Archive 3|3]], [[User talk:Crzrussian/Archive 4|4]], [[User talk:Crzrussian/Archive 5|5]], [[User talk:Crzrussian/Archive 6|6]], [[User talk:Crzrussian/Archive 7|7]], [[User talk:Crzrussian/Archive 8|8]], [[User talk:Crzrussian/Archive 9|9]], [[User talk:Crzrussian/Archive 10|10]], [[User talk:Crzrussian/Archive 11|11]], [[User talk:Crzrussian/Archive 12|12]], [[User talk:Crzrussian/Archive 13|13]], [[User talk:Crzrussian/Archive 14|14]], [[User talk:Crzrussian/Archive 15|15]], [[User talk:Crzrussian/Archive 16|16]], [[User talk:Crzrussian/Archive 17|17]], [[User talk:Crzrussian/Archive 18|18]], [[User talk:Crzrussian/Archive 19|19 <small>(incl. recall)</small>]], [[User talk:Crzrussian/Archive 20|20]], [[User talk:Crzrussian/Archive 21|21]], [[User talk:Crzrussian/Archive 22|22]], [[User talk:Crzrussian/Archive 23|23]], [[User talk:Crzrussian/Archive 24|24]], [[User talk:Crzrussian/Archive 25|25]], [[User talk:Crzrussian/Archive 26|26]], [[User talk:Crzrussian/Archive 27|27]], [[User talk:Crzrussian/Archive 28|28]], [[User talk:Crzrussian/Archive 29|29]], [[User talk:Crzrussian/Archive 30|30]], [[User talk:Crzrussian/Archive 31|31]], [[User talk:Crzrussian/Archive 32|32]], [[User talk:Crzrussian/Archive 33|33]], [[User talk:Crzrussian/Archive 34|34]], [[User talk:Crzrussian/Archive 35|35]]<br/> <br/>-Two factors in Ohio State's formative years would hinder the university's immediate development: hostility from the state's agricultural interests and competition for resources from Miami University and Ohio University.  The first arose from the curriculum debate.  Fueled by the agriculture interests and the [[Springfield, Ohio|Springfield]] business community that supplied them, the attitude of Ohio farmers towards the university had turned from one of indifference to one of outright hostility. By 1880, this hostility had begun to make its presence felt in the state legislature.  The second hindrance came in the form of competition for state allocations from Ohio's two older public institutions.  At the time of Ohio State's creation, these institutions had been derided by then Governor Hayes as borderline [[sectarian]] colleges that, in over sixty years of history, had failed to provide Ohio with a real state university.  It was this view that was fundamental in the decision to found a new university as recipient for the land-grant funds, as well as considerably strengthening the hand of those who advocated a broad based curriculum.  However, the founding of this new university combined with their own precarious financial postitions (Miami would close for a dozen years due to a lack of enrollment) had awakened the older institutions to compete vigorously for the attention of the state legislature.  The first of these issues would be resolved by the end of the decade.  Resolution of the second would not occur until 1906.  Even then, the inherent tension of agricultural interests within the larger context of a comprehensive research university and the competition among state universities in a decentralized higher education system would, to varying degrees, remain permanent issues with which Ohio State would be forced to contend. <br/>+== R' Aharon Leib [however you spell it] ==<br/> <br/>-Of fundamental importance in this period was the role of former President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] who, a decade earlier, had lobbied strenuously as Governor for the university's founding.  Upon returning to Ohio in 1881, the former President spent the next decade using his considerable political influence to lobby for the university's interests.  In 1887 he formally joined the university's [[board of trustees]] where, until his death in late 1891, he essentially acted as the university's [[de facto]] president.  By 1891, Ohio State had grown to a degree that Governor [[James E. Campbell]] recommended a permanent levy on the tax duplicate to support its continued growth.  The significant role that the fledgling university had begun to play within the state, as well as the peace that Hayes had brokered with the state's agricultural interests, was underscored by the fact that the proposal passed without opposition despite the insistence of Ohio State's board of trustees that neither Miami nor Ohio universities be included in the bill.<ref>[http://www.ohiohistory.org/onlinedoc/ohgovernment/governors/campbell.html  Ohio Historical Society James Campbell Profile].</ref><br/>+I see that you have been involved in the repeated movings of [[Aharon Leib Shteinman]].

Although the Lybarger Bill failed narrowly to gain passage, in its place was passed the compromise Eagleson Bill, which determined that all doctoral education and research functions would be the role of Ohio State and that the two older institutions would not offer instruction beyond the master's degree level.  This arrangement would stand for the next fifty years until population growth had necessitated additional Ph. D programs in the state.<br/>+Hi Crazy Russian - how is everything?  Could you help resolve a dispute before it goes to arbitration?  Back in August I took a photograph of former Secretary of Defense [[William Cohen]].  It's a good photograph; he had just written a fiction novel.  I also took some photographs of he and his wife [[Janet Langhart]].  They liked the photographs so much they wrote to tell me so; Janet Langhart even said she was glad I was able to supply an updated photograph of her husband to replace the goofy Department of Defense photograph found on his page.  I still have these e-mails. <br/> <br/>-1912 saw the formation of Ohio State's Graduate School to coordinate the university's burgeoning master's and doctoral enrollments.  In 1914, Ohio State's college of medicine was formed through a merger with Starling medical college.  That year also saw the founding of Ohio State's School of Dentistry.  In 1916, the board of trustees approved the formation of a College of Commerce and Journalism.<br/>+[[user:BCV|BCV]], another editor, is insistent that we keep all the Department of Defense photographs on every page of every former Secretary of Defense.  His argument is it creates consistency.  My argument is that if an editor has a decent updated photograph they are willing to release that an updated photograph should go on an updated encyclopedia page.  Another user on August 22nd also kept this change (though he moved the photograph of Cohen and Langhart down to the bottom - with which I agreed).  <br/> <br/>-Subsequently, Ohio State's solidifying of its role as the state's flagship, comprehensive university was fairly rapid, as demonstrated by its 1916 induction into the prestigious [[Association of American Universities]].  To date, it remains the only public university in Ohio to be extended AAU membership.  This momentum was further accelerated by Governor [[Harry L. Davis]], who in his 1921 inaugural address declared that, "In Ohio State University the commonwealth has an educational institution which should become the largest and best state institution in the United States. This is evidenced by the development of the institution in recent years, and I desire specifically to ask the co-operation of the General Assembly in the effort which I propose to make to help the Ohio State University to attain that goal in the not too distant future."  He subsequently shepherded a one-eighth of a [[mill levy|mill]] tax levy through the legislature to fund a university building fund.  Seventy-two percent of the funds were earmarked for the Ohio State University with the remainder split between [[Miami University]] and [[Ohio University]].<ref>[http://www.ohiohistory.org/onlinedoc/ohgovernment/governors/davis.html  Ohio Historical Society Harry Davis Profile].</ref> By decade's end, the university's enrollment stood at 15,126 a more than four-fold increase from just twenty years prior.<br/>+I've asked for other editors on the page to comment, but to no avail.  Cohen is not particularly old; under BCV's reasoning, Wikipedia will forever keep a 1997 photograph up.  I don't think it makes a lot of sense, especially since the man is now in a new phase of his life and continues to work.  <br/> <br/>-With the onset of the [[Great Depression]], Ohio State would face many of the challenges affecting universities throughout America as budget support was slashed, and students without the means of paying tuition returned home to support families.  By the middle thirties, however, enrollment had stabilized due in large part to the role of FERA the [[Federal Emergency Relief Administration]] and later the [[National Youth Administration]] or NYA.<ref>[http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/heq/44.3/bower.html  ''A Favored Child of the State: Federal Student Aid at Ohio Colleges and Universities, 1934–1943'' Kevin P. Bower].</ref>  By the end of the decade, enrollment had still managed to grow to 17,568.   Two important initiatives were also begun during this decade.  Each would come to play increasingly important roles in the university's development up to the present time.  In 1934, the Ohio State Research Foundation was begun to bring in outside funding for faculty research projects.  In 1938, a development office was opened to begin raising funds privately to offset reductions in state support.<br/>+Can you help to arbitrate this?  I'm a bit tired of the revert war.

At year’s end 2005, Ohio State’s endowment stood at 1.73 billion dollars ranking it seventh among public universities and twenty-seventh among all American universities.<ref>[http://www.nacubo.org/documents/research/FY05NESInstitutionsbyTotalAssets.pdf 2005 University Endowments].</ref>  In June 2006, the endowment passed the 2 billion dollar mark.  <br/>-<br/>-In recent decades, and in response to continually shrinking state funding, Ohio State has conducted two significant multi-year [[fundraising]] campaigns.  The first concluded in 1987 and raised 460 million dollars—a record at the time for a public university.  The “Affirm Thy Friendship Campaign” took place between 1995 and 2000.  With an initial goal of raising 850 million dollars, the campaign’s final tally was 1.23 billion dollars, placing Ohio State among the small group{{fact}} of public universities to have successfully conducted a billion dollar campaign.<br/>-<br/>-==Campus==<br/>-[[Image:OSU main campus map.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The main campus map, The Ohio State University.]]<br/>-Ohio State's main [[urban area|urban]] campus is located in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]].  Its 1755 acres are approximately 2.5 miles north of the city's downtown.  Four buildings are currently listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]: [[Enarson Hall]], [[Hayes Hall]], [[Ohio Stadium]], and [[Orton Hall]]. <br/>-<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Ortonhall.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Orton Hall, The Ohio State University.]] --><br/>-<br/>-Architecture on the Ohio State campus does not conform to a unifying theme such as [[gothic revival]] or [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] but rather is an eclectic mix of traditional, modern and post-modern styles.<br/>-<br/>-The [[William Oxley Thompson Memorial Library]], anchoring the western end of The Oval, is the Ohio State library's main branch and single largest repository.  Overall, Ohio State operates the 18th largest university [[research library]] in North America with a combined collection of over 5.8 million volumes.  Additionally, the libraries receive approximately 35,000 serial titles on a regular basis.  Its recent acquisitions were 16th among university research libraries in North America.<ref>[http://www.arl.org/stats/pubpdf/arlstat04.pdf Association of Research Libraries 2004 Report].</ref>  Ohio State's library system encompasses twenty-one libraries located on its Columbus campus.  An additional eight branches are located at off-campus research facilities and the regional campuses.  In all the Ohio State library system encompasses fifty-five branches and specialty collections.  Some of the more significant collections include The [[Byrd Polar Research Center]] Archival Program containing the Archives of Admiral [[Richard E. Byrd]] as well as a significant collection of polar research materials, The [[Hilandar Research Library]] which contains the world's largest collection of [[medieval]] [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] manuscripts on microform, [[The Ohio State Cartoon Research Library]], which is the world's largest repository of original cartoons, [[The Lawrence and Lee Theatre Research Institute]] and the archives of Senator [[John Glenn]].<br/>-<br/>-[[Image:Wexner.jpg|thumb|200px|Wexner Center for the Arts, The Ohio State University.]]<br/>-Anchoring the traditional campus gateway at the eastern end of The Oval, is the [[Wexner Center for the Arts]].  Designed by architects [[Peter Eisenman]] of New York and Richard Trott of Columbus, the center opened in 1989.  Its founding was financed in large part by Ohio State alumnus [[Leslie Wexner]] with a gift of twenty-five million dollars in the 1980's.  The center was founded to be a comprehensive visual arts center encompassing all aspects of visual and performing arts with a focus on new commissions and artist residencies.  Its groundbreaking [[deconstructivism|deconstructivist]] architecture has resulted in it being lauded as one of the most important buildings of its generation.  Its design has also been criticized as proving less than ideal for many of the art installations that it has attempted to display.  The centerpiece of The Wexner Center's permanent collection is [[Picasso|Picasso's]] ''Nude on a Black Armchair'', which was purchased by [[Leslie Wexner]] at auction for forty-five million dollars and then donated to the university.<br/>-<br/>-[[Image:Mirror Lake NW.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Mirror Lake, The Ohio State University.]]<br/>-To the south of The Oval is another, somewhat smaller, expanse of greenspace commonly referred to as The South Oval.  At its eastern end, it is anchored by the Ohio Union.  To the west are Enarson Hall, the Kuhn Honors House, Browning Amphitheatre (a traditional stone [[Greek theatre]]) and Mirror Lake.<br/>-<br/>-The [[OSU College of Medicine and Public Health|Ohio State College of Medicine]] is located on the southern edge of the central campus.  It is home to the [[James Cancer Hospital]], a cancer research institute and one of the [[National Cancer Institute|National Cancer Institute's]] thirty-nine [[NCI-designated Cancer Center|comprehensive cancer centers]], along with the [[Richard M. Ross Heart Hospital]], a research institute for cardiovascular disease.<br/>-<br><br/>-==Student life== <br/>-[[Image:RPAC.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Recreation and Physical Activity Center(RPAC) at The Ohio State University.]]<br/>-The Office of Student Affairs is responsible for many of the outside-the-classroom aspects of student life at Ohio State. Among these are student housing; food service; health, wellness and counseling; activities, organizations and leadership development; recreation and intramurals. The Office of Student Affairs also operates the Schottenstein Center, the Fawcett Center, the Blackwell Inn, the [[Ohio Union]] and the Drake Event Center. <br/>-<br/>-Ohio State has several student managed publications and media outlets.  ''[[The Lantern]]'' is the school's daily newspaper and has operated as a laboratory newspaper in the School of Communication (formerly the School of Journalism) since 1881.  ''Mosaic'' is a literary magazine published by Ohio State, which features undergraduate [[fiction]], [[poetry]], and [[art]]. The official yearbook of the University, ''Makio'', was started by three fraternities in 1880.  ''Makio'' ran into financial problems during the early 1970s, and the organization went bankrupt and stopped publication during the late 1970s. The book was revived from 1985 to 1994 and has since been revived again in 2000. "Ohio.fm" is the student-run radio station with an Internet audio stream (no broadcast signals are available in Columbus). Students also operate a local cable channel known as [[Buckeye TV]], which airs primarily on the campus cable system operated by UNITS (the university's telecommunications department).  <br/>-<br/>-[[The Ohio State University Marching Band]] (or [[The Ohio State University Marching Band|TBDBITL]], "The Best Damn Band in the Land") is a longstanding tradition at Ohio State. The marching band is the largest all-brass band in the world, and all songs from "Carmen Ohio" to "Hang on Sloopy" are arranged to fit this unorthodox instrumentation. The band is famous for "[[The Ohio State University Marching Band#Script Ohio|Script Ohio]]," during which the band marches single-file through the curves of the word "Ohio" while playing the famous march "Le Regiment de Sambre et Meuse." At the end of the performance, the "i" in "Ohio" is "dotted" by a high-stepping [[sousaphone]] player. <br/>-<br/>-The tradition of high quality bands is not limited to the football field. OSU's School of Music contains several high quality concert bands consisting of graduate and undergraduate music majors and non-music majors. For example, the OSU Wind Symphony, frequently receivs praise on the national level, recently having been selected to perform at the 2003 College Band Directors National Association (CBDNA) Convention.  The [[Ohio State Jazz Ensemble]] performed at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] in 1975, 1978,1986, 1996, and 2001. It has also appeared at the [[Mexico City International Jazz Festival]] in 1990 and the [[North Sea Jazz Festival]] in 1986, 1996, and 2001.   <br/>-<br/>-In addition to strong bands, the university is also recognized for outstanding choral perfomrance. The Ohio State University Men's [[Glee Club]], formed in 1875, is the oldest musical organization on campus.<ref>[http://mgc.osu.edu OSU Men's Glee Club]</ref> In 1990, led by Professor James Gallagher, the Men's Glee Club participated in the International Musical [[Eisteddfod]] in Llangolen, [[Wales]] and won the male chorus competition by an unprecedented 20 points before, in a unanimous decision of the judges, being named "Choir of the World"—the first American [[choir]] to win such an honor. The Glee Club is under the direction of Dr. Robert J. Ward.<br/>-<br/>-OSU's "[[Buckeye Bullet]]" electric car broke the world record for the fastest speed by an electric vehicle on [[October 3]], [[2004]] with a speed of 271.737 MPH (437.3 km/h) at the [[Bonneville Salt Flats]] in [[Utah]]. The vehicle also holds the US record for fastest electric vehicle with a speed of 314.958 MPH (506.9 km/h), and peak timed mile speed of 321.834 MPH (517.9 km/h). The vehicle was designed, built and managed by a team of engineering students at the university's "Center for Automotive Research-Intelligent Transportation" (CAR-IT).<br/>-<br/>-A unique aspect to Ohio State's multi billion dollar endowment is the Student Investment Management Program.  Upperclass finance students taking Business Finance 724 are given the opportunity to manage a twenty million dollar investment fund.  Returns from the student managed funds often outperform the [[S&P 500]] and frequently even the university's own professional fund managers.<ref>[http://fisher.osu.edu/fin/sim.htm Ohio State Student Investment Management Program].</ref><br/>-<br/>-On August 23rd, 2006, it was announced that during the week of October 30th to November 2nd [[Jon Stewart]] would host [[The Daily Show|The Daily Show's]] ''Battlefield Ohio: The Daily Show’s Midwest Midterm Midtacular'' from Ohio State's Roy Bowen Theatre.<ref>[http://www.columbusdispatch.com/features-story.php?story=dispatch/2006/08/23/20060823-G1-04.html ''Columbus Dispatch'' 08/23/2006].</ref><br/>-<br/>-===Residential life===<br/>-[[Image:SCampusGateway.JPG|thumb|left|300px|South Campus Gateway]]<br/>-Ohio State operates 31 on-campus residence halls divided into three geographic clusters: South Campus (site of the university's original dormitories), North Campus (largely constructed during the post-war enrollment boom) and Olentangy Area or "The Towers."  Within the residence hall system are 40 smaller living and learning environments defined by social or academic considerations.  Ohio State also offers five honors residence halls: Bradley Hall, Lincoln Tower, Siebert Hall, Taylor Tower and Worthington House.<br/>-<br/>-Separate housing for graduate and professional students is maintained on the Southern tier of campus near the medical complex.  Family housing is maintained at Buckeye Village at the far northern edge of campus beyond the athletic complex.  At the university's southeast corner along High Street, and across from the Moritz College of Law, new apartments have been built for law students in conjunction with the area's Campus Gateway project.<br/>-<br/>-===Honors programs===<br/>-Ohio State offers two distinct honors programs for high ability [[undergraduates]]: Honors and Scholars. The Honors program is open to students in all majors.  The Scholars program is centered around twelve specific programs such as "Architecture Scholars", "International Affairs Scholars" and "Politics, Society and Law Scholars."  Students in the Scholars program are expected to live and take select classes with other members of the program.  Additionally, Ohio State offers the Honors Collegium with membership extended following the Spring of a student's first or second year to the university's top undergraduates.  Collegium students try to compete for internships, graduate schools and nationally competitive awards, such as the [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes]], [[Marshall Scholarship|Marshall]] or [[Truman Scholarship|Truman]] scholarship.<br/>-<br/>-For the 2005-2006 academic year, Ohio State undergraduates were awarded the following nationally competitive scholarships: one Truman Scholarship, two Goldwater Scholarships, three Udall Scholarships, one Bieneke Scholarship, four National Science Foundation research fellowships and four Fulbright Scholarships.<ref>[http://www.osu.edu/features/2006/scholars/ Ohio State boasts 16 top scholard]</ref> Since 2000, 39 Ohio State students have been awarded [[Fulbright Scholarships]].<ref>[http://us.fulbrightonline.org/program_students_us_search.html Fulbright Scholarship Database].</ref><br/>-<br/>-Ohio State also administers two large-scale [[scholarship|scholarship programs]] to ensure access to the university to high-ability students from [[low-income]] or traditionally underrepresented groups.  The first of these, The Young Scholars Program, was inititiated in 1988.  120 promising minority students from Ohio's nine largest urban public school districts are selected prior to entering high school.  The program offers a series of academic camps each summer and counseling throughout the students' high school careers.  Upon completion of the program, which also mandates a college preparatory curriculum and minimum grade point average, the students are guaranteed admission to Ohio State as well as any need-based financial aid necessary.  The Land Grant Scholarship was initiated in 2005.  This program seeks to ensure access to Ohio State to high-ability students from low-income backgrounds.  Ohio State has committed to offering a full-ride scholarship each academic year to at least one student from each of [[Ohio county government|Ohio's 88 counties]].<br/>-<br/>-Ohio State maintains an honors center in the Kuhn Honors and Scholars House on the South Oval.  Until the 1960s this building had served as the university President's residence.  Five dormitories are designated as honors residences.<br/>-<br/>-===Activities & organizations===<br/>-[[Image:EnarsonHall.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Enarson Hall (Original Ohio Union)]]<br/>-The [[Ohio Union]] was the first student union built by a public university.  The Ohio Union is dedicated to enriching the student experience on and off the Ohio State University campus.  The first Ohio Union, located on the south edge of the South Oval, was constructed in 1909 and later renamed Enarson Hall.   The present Ohio Union was completed in 1950 and is located prominently along High Street and southeast of the Oval. It has been a center of student life at The Ohio State University for more than 50 years, providing facilities for student activities, organizations and events, and serves as an important meeting place for campus and community interaction. In addition, many student services and programs are housed in the union, along with dining and recreational facilities.<br/>-<br/>-===Student organizations===<br/>-[[Student organizations]] at The Ohio State University provide students with opportunities to get involved in a wide variety of interest areas including [[academic]], [[social]], [[religious]], [[artistic]], [[service-based]], [[diversity]] and many more.<br/>-There are over 800 registered student organizations that involve many thousands of students.<br/>-<br/>-===Leadership & service===<br/>-The Union's vision is to prepare students to be responsible, engaged leaders committed to community participation for social action and change. Examples of programs to get involved in are the [[Buckeye Leadership Society]], LeaderShape, Buckeye Service Council, Community Commitment, and Alternative Spring Break. All of these programs have the ultimate goal of making students into better leaders, people and citizens of Ohio State.<br/>-<br/>-===Student governments===<br/>-At the Ohio State University, there are three recognized student governments that represent their constituents.<br/>-*Undergraduate Student Government (USG), which consists of elected and appointed student [[representatives]] who serve as liaisons from the [[undergraduate]] student body to university officials. USG seeks to outreach to and work for the students at the Ohio State University.<br/>-*Council of Graduate Students (CGS), which promotes and provides [[academic]], [[administrative]], and social programs for the university community in general and for [[graduate students]] in particular. The Council provides a forum in which the graduate student body may present, discuss, and set upon issues related to its role in the academic and non-academic aspects of the University community.<br/>-*Inter-Professional Council (IPC), which is a representative body of all professional students in the colleges of [[Dentistry]], [[Law]], [[Medicine]], [[Optometry]], [[Pharmacy]], and [[Veterinary Medicine]]. Its purpose is to act as a [[liaison]] between these students and the governing bodies of the University.<br/>-<br/>-==Athletics==<br/>-[[Image:OSU Athletic O.jpg|thumb|200px|left|OSU Athletics logo]]<br/>-{{main|Ohio State Buckeyes}}<br/>-{{main|Ohio State Buckeyes football}}<br/>-Ohio State's intercollegiate sports teams are called the "Buckeyes" (after the state tree, the [[Ohio Buckeye|Buckeye]]), and participate in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s Division I in all sports (Division I-A in football) and the [[Big Ten Conference]] in most sports. (The men's [[ice hockey|hockey]] program competes in the [[Central Collegiate Hockey Association]], and its women's hockey program competes in the [[Western Collegiate Hockey Association]]). The school colors are Scarlet and Gray, although they were originally black and orange. The colors were not used however, because Princeton already used the colors. The teams' nickname is "Buckeyes" and "Brutus" the Buckeye is their mascot.<br/>-<br/>-Ohio State is one of only two universities (the [[University of Michigan]] being the other) to have won an NCAA national championship in baseball, men's basketball, and football.  Ohio State has also won national championships in men's swimming & diving, men's outdoor track & field, men's golf, men's gymnastics, men's fencing, co-ed fencing, and synchronized swimming.<ref>[http://www.ncaa.org/champadmin/champs_listing1.html NCAA National Championship Database].</ref>  Since the inception of the [[NACDA Director's Cup|Athletic Director's Cup]], Ohio State has finished in the top 25 each year, including top 6 finishes in three of the last five years.<ref>[http://nacda.cstv.com/directorscup/nacda-directorscup-previous-scoring.html Athletic Directors' Cup Records].</ref>  During the 2005-2006 school year Ohio State became this first Big Ten team to win conference championships in Football, Men's Basketball and Women's Basketball.<br/>-<br/>-Outstanding sports figures that were student athletes at Ohio State include 1936 Olympics gold medalist [[Jesse Owens]] "the Buckeye Bullet" (track and field), [[John Havlicek]], [[Jerry Lucas]], [[Bobby Knight]], and [[Larry Siegfried]] (basketball), [[Katie Smith]] (women's basketball), [[Frank Howard (baseball player)|Frank Howard]] (basketball and baseball), [[Jack Nicklaus]] (golf); and [[Chic Harley]] (three-time All-American football running back).  Ohio State football players have combined for seven [[Heisman Trophy|Heisman Awards]] including two-time  winner [[Archie Griffin]] in 1974 and 1975, [[Eddie George]] in 1995, and most recently [[Troy Smith]] in 2006.  Unfortunately, the fans of this insitution's football program often make the university difficult to root for, as they seem to lack any shred of objectivity.  Hall of Fame coaches at Ohio State have included [[Paul Brown]] and [[Woody Hayes]] in football, [[Fred Taylor]] in basketball, [[Larry Snyder]] in track and field, and [[Mike Peppe]] in swimming and diving.<br/>-<br/>-==Ohio State-affiliated media==<br/>-Ohio State operates a [[public]] [[television station]], [[WOSU-TV]] 34 / WOSU-DT 38 (a local [[PBS]] [[TV]] station), as well as two public radio stations, [[WOSU (AM)|WOSU-AM]] ([[National Public Radio|NPR]]/[[BBC]]) and [[WOSU-FM]] ([[european classical music|Classical]]) in Columbus. In 2003, the television station began broadcasting in [[High-definition television|HDTV]].<br/>-<br/>-==Notable alumni==<br/>-{{main|List of Ohio State University people}}<br/>-<br/>-Ohio State currently has almost 400,000 living alumni located around the world.

Comparable in use to "Loose Lips might Sink Ships" in the US.]] <br/>+Please refer to<br/> <br/>-The policy of '''Sweden during World War II'''  was to remain [[neutral]]. The [[Swedish neutrality]] had been in use for more than a century, since the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].<br/>+http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:V<br/> <br/>-When hostilities began on [[1 September]] [[1939]], the fate of [[Sweden]] was unclear.  Eventually, only five European nations were capable of sustaining a policy of neutrality throughout the entire war, even though 20 nations had held a policy of neutrality in September 1939.  Sweden was one of those countries able to maintain this delicate balance and avoid engagement in the [[European Theatre of World War II|European Theatre]]. Sweden owed this to its northerly location in the [[Scandinavian Peninsula]], its long-held neutral stance in [[international relations]], a dedicated military build-up and to an unpredictable course of events which went in its favour. Another factor was that the [[Swedish government]] made concessions to [[Nazi Germany]], such as allowing the [[Wehrmacht]] to use Swedish [[railway]]s to transport an [[infantry division]] from [[Norway]] to [[Finland]] and to transport soldiers on leave between [[Norway]] and [[Germany]]. <br/>+If you wish to test out the page editing process,<br/>+you may do so in our Sandbox located at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sandbox<br/> <br/>-==Anglo-German Naval Agreement==<br/>-{{Main|Anglo-German Naval Agreement}}<br/>+If you're interested in becoming an editor, check out<br/>+http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:TUTORIAL<br/> <br/>-Sweden's long-standing policy of neutrality was severely tested on numerous occasions during the [[1930s]].  The challenges came from a strongly rejuvenated, [[Nazi Germany|nationalistic Germany]]. From 1919 until 1935, Sweden had been an active supporter of the [[League of Nations]].  Most of Sweden's energy in the international arena had been directed towards preservation of the League. However, the [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]] (AGNA) of [[1935]] seriously jeopardised both Sweden's independence and its long-standing policy of peaceful neutrality. Signed on [[June 18]], 1935, the agreement was a great shock to many Swedes.  AGNA allowed Germany to increase the size of its [[Kriegsmarine|navy]] to one-third the size of the British [[Royal Navy]], despite the provisions agreed in the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. At the same time, Britain agreed to withdraw its navy from the [[Baltic Sea]], leaving the Kriegsmarine the dominant [[power (international)|power]] in that sea.  This became a potential threat to Sweden and other countries in [[Scandinavia|region]].<br/>+Thank you for your interest!<br/> <br/>-==Pre-War Militarization==<br/>+--><br/>+[[Image:Chuck Norris award 2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Chuck Norris being presented with the "Veteran of the Year" award at the American Veteran awards show]]<br/>+'''Carlos Ray Norris Jr.''', known as '''Chuck Norris''', (born [[March 10]], [[1940]]), is a [[martial art]]ist, an [[United States|American]] [[action movie]] [[actor]] and [[Hollywood]] star.<br/> <br/>-Beginning in 1936, the Swedish government regularly increased its defense budget to strengthen its military preparedness as the international situation was seen to worsen.  Military spending went from $37 million in 1936, to $50 million in 1937, to $58.575 million in 1938, and then increased over five-fold to $322.325 million in 1939.  During the war itself, military spending peaked in 1942 at $527.575 million.<br/>+==Biography==<br/>+===Beginnings===<br/> <br/>-During European hostilities, Swedish industry had to supply an increased share of domestic goods, due the German blockade of the [[North Sea]], as well as to satisfy the vastly increased demand for armaments.  Before the war, annual production of armaments typically totalled tens of millions of Swedish [[swedish krona|kronor]], but during the war, output exceeded [[SEK]] 1 billion (US$240 million).<br/>+A native of [[Ryan, Oklahoma]], Norris has two younger brothers, Wieland and Aaron Norris, the latter of which is a Hollywood producer. Norris was born to an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] [[Cherokee]] Indian father and [[Irish people|Irish]] mother.{{ref|parents}}  When Norris was ten, his parents divorced{{ref|ten}} and he later relocated to [[Torrance, California|Torrance]], [[California]] with his mother and brothers.{{ref|Torrance}} Norris describes his childhood as downbeat.  He was unathletic, shy, and scholastically mediocre.  Kids would taunt his mixed ethnicity — wistfully he wanted to beat up his tormenters.{{ref|notkickingass}}  He finished high school and soon married his girlfriend, Diane Holechek. In 1958 Norris joined the [[United States Air Force]] as a [[Military police|Military Policeman]] and was sent to Osan Air Base [[South Korea]]. It was in South Korea that Norris acquired the nickname ''Chuck'' and began his training in [[Tang Soo Do]], an interest that would segue into [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belts]] in Tang Soo Do and [[Taekwondo]], both Korean martial arts, Shinto-Ryu [[Karate]], and a brown belt in [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]]; and the founding of the [[Chun Kuk Do]] ("Universal Way") form and the education association ([[United Fighting Arts Federation]]). When he returned to the states he continued to act as an MP at [[March Air Reserve Base|March Air Force Base]] California. <br/>+Norris was discharged in August of 1962 without seeing combat.  He  worked for the [[Northrop]] corporation and opened a chain of karate schools, which the son of [[Steve McQueen]] attended.{{ref|McQueen}}<br/> <br/>-Not only was the Swedish government buying materiel to strengthen its defenses, it began [[conscription | drafting]] conscripts. On [[May 6]], [[1938]], the government called up the entire conscript class of 1923, then at the age of 35, for short periods of training. In addition to this, the Swedish [[Cabinet]] ordered that one quarter of the 1938 military draft intake be retained for further training.<br/>+===Rise to fame===<br/> <br/>-In [[1940]], the ''Swedish Home Guard'', or [[Swedish Home Guard | Hemvärnet]], was created.  Its units comprised small groups of former professional soldiers who were equipped with rifles, machine guns, ammunition, medicine and uniforms.  They had the option to buy additional materials such as [[ski warfare|skis]], sweaters and marching boots. The ''Swedish Women's Voluntary Defence Service'', or [[Lottorna]], had been created in 1924.<br/>+In [[1968]], Norris became Middleweight Karate champion (non-contact), a title he held for seven consecutive years.{{ref|middleweight}}  In [[1969]], he won Karate's triple crown for the most tournament wins of the year, and the ''fighter of the year'' award by ''Black Belt'' magazine. It was also in 1969 that Norris made his acting debut, in the [[Dean Martin]] movie ''[[The Wrecking Crew (1969 film)|The Wrecking Crew]]''.  <br/> <br/>-While arming itself, Sweden felt that it was necessary to articulate and enforce its policy of neutrality. [[Prime Minister of Sweden|Prime Minister]] [[Per Albin Hansson]] stated shortly before the Second World War began: "Friendly with all other nations and strongly linked to our neighbors, we look on no one as our enemy. There is no place in the thoughts of our people for aggression against any other country, and we note with gratitude assurances from others that they have no wish to disturb our peace, our freedom, or our independence. The strengthening of our defense preparations serves merely to underline our fixed determination to keep our country outside the conflicts among others and, during such conflicts, to safeguard the existence of our people." Other members of the Swedish government expressed similar sentiments.  However, in the first years of the war, Sweden remained amiable to [[Nazi Germany]] and provided it with important goods like iron ore, essential to the war effort.<br/>+In [[1970]], his younger brother Weiland was killed in Vietnam. Norris later dedicated his ''[[Missing in Action (film)|Missing in Action]]'' films to his brother's memory. <br/> <br/>-[[Georg Homin]], a captain on the [[General Staff]], said, "without a defensive force we cannot follow any policy of our own, our declarations become merely empty words, and we leave the country's fate to chance or to the decision of others. With a defense as strong as Swedish conditions allow we secure for ourselves the basis of a continued independent Swedish policy."<br/>+At a martial arts demonstration in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], Norris met the soon to be famous [[Bruce Lee]].  In [[1972]], he acted as Bruce Lee's nemesis in the movie ''[[Way of the Dragon]]'', and in [[1974]], McQueen encouraged him to begin acting classes at the MGM Studio.<br/> <br/>-==The Defence of Finland==<br/>-{{Main|Sweden and the Winter War}}<br/>+Norris' first starring role was [[1977]]'s ''[[Breaker, Breaker!]]'', and subsequent films such as ''[[The Octagon]]'' (1980), ''[[An Eye for an Eye (movie)|An Eye for an Eye]]'' (1981), and ''[[Lone Wolf McQuade]]'' proved his increasing box office bankability. In [[1984]], Norris starred in ''[[Missing in Action (film)|Missing in Action]]'', the first of a series of POW rescue fantasies produced by Israeli cousins [[Menahem Golan]] and [[Yoram Globus]] and released under their [[Cannon Films]] banner.  Also in that year, he was offered the part of the sensei of the villain dojo in the movie [[The Karate Kid]], but declined the part.  He reportedly did not want to take part in depicting martial artists in an unfavorable light. [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087538/trivia].  <br/> <br/>-[[Image:Lapland1940.png|right|frame|Franco-British support was offered on the condition it was given free passage through [[neutral country|neutral]] [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] instead of taking the road from [[Petsamo]]. The reason was a wish to occupy the iron ore districts in [[Kiruna]] and [[Malmberget]].<br><small>(Borders as of 1920&ndash;1940.)</small>]]<br/>+Over the next four years, Norris became Cannon's most prominent star, appearing in eight films, including ''[[Code of Silence]]'', ''[[The Delta Force (movie)|The Delta Force]]'' and ''[[Firewalker]]'', in which he co-starred with Academy Award winner [[Louis Gossett, Jr.]]<br/> <br/>-When the [[Soviet Union]] attacked Finland in 1939, an overwhelming number of Swedes favoured some sort of involvement in the conflict, both on a [[humanitarian]] and a military basis. Sweden's interest in Finland lay in the fact that Finland had been an integrated part of Sweden for more than six hundred years, Sweden losing control of the eastern provinces in [[1809]]. Despite the government's policy of neutrality, as many as 8,000 Swedes voluntarily went to Finland to help the Finns defend their homeland against the advancing [[Red Army]] during the [[Winter War]]. The Swedish government did send food, clothing, medicine and a small quantity of weapons and ammunition to aid the Finns at the beginning of the war, but avoided any official military involvement. In addition, some 70,000 Finnish children were sent to safety from Finland to Sweden during the [[1940]]s [http://www.hs.fi/kuva/1076154390838].<br/>+===Walker, Texas Ranger===<br/> <br/>-==Press Freedom and Public Perceptions==<br/>-The public's sentiments were widely published in the [[Media in Sweden|Swedish press]], causing many protests from the German government and prompting the Swedish government to [[censorship|censor]] areas of the press on a limited basis. In Sweden, the Press fell under the control of several councils, despite contemporary claims that the Swedish press was free. The [[Swedish Government War Information Board]] determined what military information was released and what information remained secret. The [[Swedish Press Council]] served as a "promotion of good relations between the press and the public authorities and to serve as an instrument of self-discipline for the press." The Press Council issued warnings, public or confidential, to those who abused the freedom of the press.<br/>+[[Image:NorrisAsWalker.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Chuck Norris as Cordell Walker in ''[[Walker, Texas Ranger]]'']]<br/> <br/>-To say that Sweden had a truly free press was somewhat false. Sweden was concerned that its neutrality might run the risk of being unbalanced should its Press be too vocal in its opinions. Both the Press Council and the Information Board issued comments such as "As far as the material received permits, attempts should be made not to give prominence to the reports of one side at the expense of the other", or "headlines, whether on the billboards or in the newspapers, should be worded in such a way as to avoid favouring one side or the other", and finally, "editorials and surveys as well as articles discussing military events or the military situation, should be strictly objective...".<br/>+By the close of the [[1980s]], Cannon Films had faded from prominence, and Norris' star appeal seemed to go with it. He reprised his Delta Force role for [[MGM]], who had acquired the Cannon library after the latter's [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy. Norris went on to make several more largely ignored films before making a transition to [[television]].  In [[1993]], he began shooting the series ''[[Walker, Texas Ranger]]'', which lasted eight years on [[CBS]] and continued in heavy syndication on other channels. <br/> <br/>-==Foreign Trade==<br/>-{{Main|Swedish iron ore during World War II}}<br/>+On October 16th, 2005, CBS Premiered the Sunday night "Movie of the Week" ''Walker Texas Ranger: Trial By Fire''. The production was a continuation of the series, and not scripted to be a reunion movie. Norris reprised his role as Cordell Walker for the movie.  He has stated that future Walker Texas Ranger "Movie of the Week" projects are expected.<br/> <br/>-A vital factor in Sweden's relations with the [[great power]]s, (particularly Germany and Britain), was trade. Prior to the war, Sweden had important trade connections with both countries. The outbreak of war in September 1939 obviously threatened these dealings. If Sweden had shown preference to either side in the war, it would have threatened its neutrality and even  its independence. Maintaining such trading partnerships was not only important politically, but in an economic sense as well. For example, in 1938 24 percent of Sweden's total [[exports]] went to Britain, with another 18 percent to Germany. When the Second World War began, trade between both countries was greatly affected.<br/>+==Family==<br/> <br/>-At the beginning of the war, agreements were signed between Sweden and the two great powers in order to sustain these vital export markets. However when Germany invaded Denmark and Norway in April 1940, coupled with a German blockade of the North Sea, Sweden's trade with Britain was cut by a total of 70 percent. Within the blockade, trade with Germany increased, until 37 percent of Sweden's exports were shipped to Germany.<br/>+In [[1963]], his son Mike was born; a second son, Eric, followed in [[1965]]. After 30 years of marriage, Norris and Holechek divorced in [[1988]].  He married again in [[1998]], this time to former model Gena O'Kelley, and she delivered twins in [[2001]]: Dakota Alan Norris, a boy, and Danilee Kelly Norris, a girl.<br/> <br/>-==Potential Allied Invasion==<br/>-''See also: [[Allied campaign in Norway]]''<br/>+== Popular culture ==<br/> <br/>-There was much speculation as to whether the Allies would consider an invasion of the European continent by way of [[Scandinavia]] rather than across the [[English Channel]]. Hitler was very  concerned by such a prospect and was almost convinced that the [[Allies]] would invade Europe by way of Norway. Hitler's letter to Sweden's King [[Gustaf V of Sweden|Gustaf V]], dated [[April 24]], [[1940]], said, "I have no doubt that our action ([[Operation Weserübung|the invasion of Norway and Denmark]]), which at the last moment forestalled the execution of the Allied plan and which under all circumstances will stop France and England from getting a foothold in Scandinavia, will have consequences which will be a blessing to the Scandinavian peoples." Had such an Allied invasion of Norway occurred, Sweden would have undoubtedly been grieveously affected. Sweden was considered to be situated in a prime location for air bases for Allied planes to effect [[air raids]] into the Germany. Even towards the end of the war, when German capitulation seemed imminent, the Allies considered an invasion of Sweden, due in large part to Sweden's strategic location in relation to Germany.<br/>+Norris regained popularity as a [[cult icon]] during the mid-2000's, especially on the Internet. Among the more high-profile parodies and references are these instances:<br/>+* ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'''s parent company, NBC, acquired Universal in early [[2004]], giving O'Brien permission to show footage of ''Walker, Texas Ranger'' without paying royalties. O'Brien and his writers subsequently created a new segment in which O'Brien shows short, out of context clips for comedic purposes. The "Walker, Texas Ranger Lever" quickly became one of the most popular segments on Late Night, with Norris himself showing up to parody his show and using his martial arts on O'Brien. This segment has been credited as jump-starting the Norris craze and leading to enough interest to produce a ''Walker, Texas Ranger'' TV movie.<br/>+* Norris is the object of an [[Internet phenomenon]] known as ''[[Chuck Norris Facts]]'' documenting and proclaiming fictional feats and characteristics, which began to circulate in late [[2005]]. Norris has written his own response to the parody on his website, stating that he doesn't feel offended by them, and finds some of them funny. [http://www.chucknorris.com/html/events.aspx]<br/>+* Norris is a main character in a Flash movie made by [[Neil Cicierega]], called Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny, released December [[2005]]. [http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/285267]<br/>+* Norris was parodied in a ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' skit entitled "The Young Chuck Norris", aired [[January 21]], [[2006]].  [http://www.youtube.com/w/Young-Chuck-Norris---SNL?v=NBSpNPzVsMM&feature=Views&page=1&t=t&f=b]<br/>+* Norris has also become a sort of pop-icon on many websites big and small around the Internet, even ascending to [[meme]] status in some situations; this seems particularly associated with Internet photo-BBS websites, such as [[YTMND]].com.<br/>+* Chuck Norris sponsors the infomercial, [[Total Gym Fitness]], which usually airs in the late night or early morning hours.<br/> <br/>-==German Pressure==<br/>-When Germany invaded Norway and Denmark on the 9th of April, 1940, demands were made stating that Sweden was to keep neutral and refrain from mobilizing to aid her neighbours. German communications were to continue uninterrupted through Swedish channels and the trade with iron ore was not to be disturbed. The Swedish government agreed, but secretly increased her armed forces during the following weeks, from 100,000 men to 320,000. More demands followed during the spring and summer, particularly for the transit of medical personnel, later stepped up to include ammunition and soldiers on leave. During the summer of 1941, the Swedish government was forced to accept the transit of a fully equipped German division headed to Finland, bound for the recently opened eastern front. In February, 1942, German presence in Norway was stepped up in preparation of an invasion of Sweden. Hitler was dissatisfied with Swedish cooperation and doubted its ability to defend against an allied attack through Norway, threatening ore resources. 300,000 Swedish soldiers were sent to the western border to train and prepare, but no invasion came and the crisis dissipated.<br/>+== Trivia == <br/>+* In [[1990]], Norris founded the non-profit organization ''Kick Drugs Out of America''. It has since been renamed [[KICKSTART]].<br/>+* Chuck Norris became an 8th degree black belt in [[Tae Kwon Do]]. He is considered a "Grand Master" in this discipline. [http://www.chucknorris.com/html/biog.html]<br/>+* Norris once did a recording session with [[Alan Morse]] of [[Spock's Beard]] [http://www.spocksbeard.com/faq.html].<br/>+* Chuck Norris teaches [[Bob Barker]] karate and [[Tang Soo Do]].<br/>+* Chuck Norris is the founder of the [[World Combat League]].<br/>+*Chuck Norris was killed in 2006 by Lewis Jones, an obsessed fan and a troubled young man. FACT! <br/>+<!-- THIS SECTION IS NOT THOSE CHUCK NORRIS "FACTS" FLOATING AROUND THE INTERNETS. --><br/> <br/>-==After 1943==<br/>-From 1943 onwards, Germany began to meet with a greater amount of misfortune after its losses at [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]] and elsewhere. Germany was forced into a more defensive position, while Allied forces met with greater success on the battlefield, such as in [[North Africa]]. Such a position allowed Sweden to be more decisive in its own policies and actions. Prior to 1943, Sweden's policy of neutrality was largely under the influence of German politics and the course of events that involved Germany, and it has been said that of the neutral nations in Europe during the war, only [[Switzerland]] and [[Portugal]] were completely neutral at that time. Following August and September 1943, Sweden was able to resist German demands and soften its stance to Allied pressure. However, despite Germany's defensive posture, Sweden was in constant fear that "the whole course of events suggested that the unexpected might happen," an attitude that was sustained until the very end of the war. With Germany's weakening position came stronger demands from the Allies. The Allies pushed for Sweden to abandon its trade with Germany, and to stop all [[Transit of German troops through Scandinavia (WWII)|German troop transit over Swedish soil]]. Sweden initially turned down such requests, but over time gradually gave in to the demands.<br/>+== Filmography ==<br/> <br/>-In 1943 Sweden received many [[Jewish]] immigrants from Denmark. With the dissolution of the Danish government in the summer of 1943, the German authorities had decided to deport the Danish Jewish population to concentration camps. However, the Danes successfully transported the vast majority to Sweden in a vast [[Rescue_of_the_Danish_Jews|rescue effort]].  There, they were granted asylum. Many stayed in Sweden after the war.<br/>+[[Image:Invasionusa.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Movie poster of ''Invasion USA'', starring Chuck Norris]]<br/>+*''[[The Wrecking Crew (1969 film)|The Wrecking Crew]]'' ([[1969 in film|1969]])<br/>+*''[[Way of the Dragon]]'' ([[1972 in film|1972]])<br/>+*''[[The Student Teachers]]'' ([[1973 in film|1973]])<br/>+*''[[Slaughter in San Francisco]]'' ([[1974 in film|1974]])<br/>+*''[[The Warrior Within]]'' ([[1976 in film|1976]]) (documentary)<br/>+*''[[Bruce Lee, the Legend]]'' ([[1977 in film|1977]]) (documentary)<br/>+*''[[Breaker!

The title is a parody of the film ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]''.<br/>+<br/>+==Plot summary==<br/>+{{spoiler}}<br/>+A [[United States Army|US Army]] recruiter visits [[Chris Griffin|Chris]]' school, giving a picture of army life consisting of women in bikinis, money, and [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] awards (with a quick disclaimer, "Your experience may differ.") Chris is impressed, and tells his parents he wants to join. They are opposed to the idea, and decide to find another activity to distract him.<br/>+<br/>+Peter notices a goth metal band practicing at the school, and introduces Chris. They doubt Chris can sing, but are impressed by his scream when [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] drops a [[piano]] on Chris' foot.<br/>+<br/>+The [[band]], Splash Log, is a hit with Chris singing "Evil, Evil Monkey" at a school dance, but the noise and antisocial attitude Chris picks up bothers Lois and Peter. They notice he's a fan of [[Marilyn Manson (singer)|Marilyn Manson]], so they confront Manson at the [[Grammy Awards|Grammys]]. He goes back to the house to talk to Chris. Manson encourages Chris to respect his parents and be a responsible citizen. Manson suggests that Peter and Chris share an activity like fishing.<br/>+<br/>+Meanwhile, [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] is outraged by the army's distortions, and along with Stewie goes to a recruiting station to complain. Stewie is impressed by the guns and enlists, and collects a bonus for signing up Brian too. Brian does poorly at [[boot camp]] and plans to desert, but Stewie encourages him to stay. <br/>+<br/>+They pass basic training and are deployed to [[Iraq]]. Unfortunately, the war is too scary and dangerous for them so they try to get discharged by pretending to be gay and shooting themselves in the foot but nothing works. Fortunately for them, [[democracy]] abruptly kicks in exactly as [[George W. Bush]] predicted.<br/>+<br/>+<br/>+==Cultural references==<br/>+<br/>+*The sergeant's banter with Brian includes the lyrics from [[Tina Turner]]'s "Private Dancer".<br/>+*During the obstacle course Brian rides a [[unicycle]], solves a [[Rubik's Cube]], plays [[Perfection (Game)|Perfection]], [[Where's Waldo|finds Waldo]], offers a couple eating salad at a dinner table some fresh pepper, and consoles a woman who was just dumped by her boyfriend.<br/>+*Also during the obstacle course, the theme to the film ''[[Stripes (film)|Stripes]]'' plays.<br/>+*The [[Zidane headbutt|infamous head butt]] of [[Zinedine Zidane]] is referenced in a cutaway in which the French football player, as part of a birthday telegram, headbutts an elderly woman unconscious and drops a birthday cake on her. He then says "Bon anniversaire" ("Happy birthday" in French).<br/>+*When the Griffins are looking for Marilyn Manson at the Grammys some well known musicians are seen in the background which include [[Bob Geldof]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[MC Hammer]], [[Ashlee Simpson]], [[Will Smith]] and [[Sisqó]].<br/>+*While in Chris's room Lois and Peter repeat lines from a popular [[Wu-Tang Clan]] song titled "Bring Da Ruckus" found on Chris's floor.<br/>+*Chris's singing voice is realized in a similar way to the cavemen in Mel Brooks' ''[[History of the World: Part I]]''.<br/>+*The background music to the US Army commercial is reminiscent to [[Def Leppard]]'s "[[Pour Some Sugar on Me]]".<br/>+*''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]'' character [[Robert Barone]] is parodied in his own sitcom, in which all the jokes seem to be revolving about Ray and Debra from the first show. This could be an allusion to [[Brad Garrett]]'s new show ''[['Til Death]]'', which is very similar to ''Everybody Loves Raymond''. Disspirited, Garrett's character groans loudly, sounding eerily similar to ''[[The Addams Family]]'''s butler Lurch.<br/>+*There are references to the musicals ''[[West Side Story]]'', ''[[Anything Goes]]'', ''[[Miss Saigon]]'', and ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]''.<br/>+*When Brian and Stewie are marching in boot camp, the march turns into choreographed dancing to "Mambo" from "The Dance at the Gym" in ''West Side Story''.<br/>+*Much of the lines spouted by the sergeant to Brian, as well as the scene where the sergeant finds a half-eaten bird in Brian's foot locker, is an allusion to ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]'' where Gunnery Sergeant Hartman finds a jelly donut in Private Pyle's foot locker.<br/>+*After a suicide bomber blows himself up near Stewie and Brian, part of Stewie's distress call is "[[Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman]]", an obscure soap opera satire from the mid-seventies. He also says "Charlie Tango Cash," which references to the 1989 film ''[[Tango & Cash]]'' starring Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell.<br/>+*The scene where Manson gives advice to Chris is also very similar to [[Alice Cooper]] explaining some of the history of [[Milwaukee]] in a famous scene from [[Wayne's World]].<br/>+*Stewie says "He didn't mean Iraq, he meant Fraggle Iraq", a reference to the 80's TV show Fraggle Rock.<br/>+<br/>+==Notes==<br/>+*[[Meg Griffin|Meg]] is shown at the dinner table, but does not say one word in the episode; [[Mila Kunis]], who plays Meg, is still credited in the end credits though.<br/>+*Vern and Johnny, the vaudeville duo, after many appearances in other episodes, are killed by Stewie in this episode.<br/>+*Stewie breaks the [[fourth wall]] twice in this episode:<br/>+** After killing Vern and Johnny, he states, "OK. They're dead. All right? We're not going to be seeing them again."<br/>+** When Brian contemplates deserting the army, Stewie tells him "they'll go after you like Peter went after that hockey coach." When no cutaway appears, Stewie says "What, no clip? I thought we had a clip."<br/>+*Although Stewie and Brian both are shot in the foot, their wounds both inexplicably disappear after the clip of democracy kicking in Iraq.<br/>+*The song "Evil, Evil Monkey" is a reference to the [[List of characters from Family Guy#The Evil Monkey(s)|Evil Monkey]] that lives in Chris' closet.<br/>+*This episode, which was mostly about the [[War in Iraq]], aired [[November 5]], [[2006]], the same day that [[Saddam Hussein]] was sentenced to death.<br/>+*Out of all the [[U.S. Army]] ranks shown in the episode,only one is an actual Army rank.

Gothic architecture was of course a pan-European 'movement,' but English Gothic (at least after c. 1200) really _was_ fairly distinct from (though not uninfluenced by) Continental Gothic.

The phrase "a specific "Merry England" that was not Catholic (always an issue with the Gothic style), yet full of lively detail" is not about ''our'' issues, but about English Protestant reservations about the [[Gothic Revival]], expressed both before and after [[Catholic Emancipation]]. Surely such strains that run through the culture can be referred to without having to be ''demonstrated'' at every turn.  As for Gothic architecture in England (locally "Early English"), one of the very ''first'' things one comes to understand when one first picks up a book or article on the subject is that it was being built by French masons in England in the 13th century as often as northern French cathedrals were built by English ones, working in a common style for patrons in an upper class, both lay and ecclesiastical, who were mostly related to one another. There is more variation ''[within'' England. But I think everyone knows that.

The Louvre monkey is simply too deep to fit the niche in which it was supposedly situated on the fountain it was originally designed and created for. The quality of the monkey in the Louvre is also up for debate; the form is not lifelike, the fur is not realistic and the pose does not match the poses of the monkeys in the [[Uffizi]] drawing, which after all, is the only evidence for the monkeys being in the niches. Colin Wilson's monkeys, however, do match this drawing, are made of a gunmetal dated to the 16th/17th century, are unrefined and of a high lead content, all of which are traits of a work of Giambologna.

He fought (1792—93) in the campaign that resulted in the second partition (1793) of Poland (see Poland, partitions of). In 1794 he issued a call at Kraków for a national uprising and led the Polish forces against both Russians and Prussians in a gallant but unsuccessful rebellion that ended with the final partition of Poland. He was imprisoned, and after being freed (1796) went to the United States and later (1798) to France, where after the fall of Napoleon he pleaded with Alexander I of Russia for Polish independence.

Research has shown that the Kosciusko Family was of a mixed Lithuanian (Baltic/non-Slavic/Catholic) and Ruthenian (Eastern Slavic/Orthodox/modern-day Belarussian) ancestry. Many tend to confuse him as a Polish (Western Slav/Catholic) because he was Catholic (from his Baltic-Lithuanian ancestry) and Slavic (through his Belarussian ancestry). He was Polish in the sense that he came from the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. During that period all people from the Commonwealth were called "Polish". While abroad, most citizens from the Commonwealth would call themselves "Polish Citizens", but would also note whether they were of Poland, "the Kingdom", (signifying that one was ethnic Polish), of Lithuania, "the Grand Duchy", (signifying that one is Ethnic Lithuanian or Belarussian). In the Untied States Library of Congress, a letter from Kosciusko states specifically that he is from Poland, but of Lithuanian nationality. \t <br/>-In general, many families from the region of his birth are from mixed Lithuanian (Baltic) and Belarussian families. The first families were Baltic-Lithuanians (non-Slavic), who later intermarried with the Eastern Slavic (Belarussian) clans who began to occupy the same territory. Many of today's modern Belarussians (People from the modern Belarus, Republic of) are neither wholly Slavic or Baltic, but a mixture of the two, similar to what Thaddeus would have been considered.<br/>-==PD phot0==<br/>-http://www.usma.edu/Tour/Monument_img.asp<br/>---[[User:Evrik|evrik]] 21:09, 24 July 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>---------------------------------------------<br/>-<br/>-Of course Kosciuszko was of ruthenian/rusin (NOT russian) descent! His name suggests that! But he was a citizen of the commonwealth, he was szlachta which was a specific state of people who had their own mythology and traditions. The Commonwealth was a multinational country and many people who had non polish roots considered themselves SZLACHTA and therefore part of the  Polish culture which was it's main component (others include Turkic (especially) , Lithuanian, Latin and Ruthenian culture which formed the metling pot). Hence Kościuszko was a Pole in the SZLACHTA sense just like Radziwills (sorry Lithuanian friends for the Polish spelling), who polonised in the 16th century, Wisniowieccy, a very powerful ruthenian clan and maaaany others. They where SZLACHTA, gentry, nobility, aristocracy and they had a strong tie to the SZLACHTA culture which came out of Poland. City dwellers, jews and peasants did not feel this tie that's why after the fall of the commonwealth Lithuanian could be reconstructed by Tadeusz Wróblewski because the local peasants still spoke it (and quite interestingly it was an archaic form from the medieval. Wróblewski obviously himself was SZLACHTA and spoke Polish even though he lived in Lithuania. <br/>-<br/>-Also let me point out the names of some prominent polish politicians in recent years : Miller, Hausner, Huebner, also check out the wiki-article on John Albert Habsburg who was a polish soldier during WW2. "Poland" was a melting pot of many cultures and many ethnicities that were tied by a common grand culture (Sarmatianism, "polish" baroque). In the cities most were Germans or Jews, peasants only felt local ties and only were the subjects of the king and the gentry was very diverse! Potocki , Koniecpolski were medieval polish families... Radziwills came out of Lithuania, Wisniowieccy, Glinscy, Ostrogscy, Sapieha were Ruthenians (actually most magnate families were ruthenian). I guess you could compare it to the situation in the US.<br/>-<br/>-The important question is when did the modern polish nation form? In the XIXth century. The culture and feeling of a grand national tie started applying to the peasantry (80% of the populace)... Mostly thanks to literature... What was the link between a Poznan city shopkeeper under the prussian partition and a farmer in western ukraine? Mickiewicz, Sienkiewicz, the myths and pathos of national uprisings. Also the XIXth century is the time of revival of Lithuanian nation which has the same roots but grew different branches.<br/>-<br/>-btw the great polish researcher Joachim Lelewel is a national hero in Belgium where he fled to after the 1831 uprising.

That being, wether it is appropriate for parents to be able to decide to cut off part of their child, when the evidence as to wether this is beneficial is unclear at best? The medical analysis should not factoring in what "may" happen to someone at an extremely old age based upon neo-natal circumcision, but rather it should focus on what can happen from the span of birth to 18 years of age. At this age, or even younger, they are competent to decide wether they want part of their penis cut off or not. Therefore, if the risks of circumcision up until 18 years of age do not heavily outweigh the benefits of reamining intact, then there is no basis for one human being to be allowed to slice off part of another human being.<br/>-<br/>-:[[Ethical analysis of infant circumcision]] -- go write it.<br/>-:I, personally, don't think there is any medical justification for routine infant circumcision. However I can understand that parents would decide to have their child circumcised if circumcision is widely practised (eg. for religious reasons) in the society it will grow up in, even if there is no medical need for it. It'd reduce psychological problems during puberty, which might be a good thing.<br/>-:However I think hygiene is a non-issue because parents should educate their children on genital hygiene just like they tell them how to brush their teeth. That restrooms are lacking means of genital hygiene is a seperate issue.<br/>-:As for the argument that circumcision is mutilation -- every surgical operation is mutilation. If you know a bit about law, you know that even getting a piercing is effectively voluntary mutilation -- the word ''voluntary'' is the important bit. In the case of children it's the parents' decision. Just like getting the child's ears pierced so it can wear ear rings (although that's oftenly based on a wish of the child and delayed until after infancy for medical reasons, it's just a culturally accepted form of body modification).<br/>-:Comming from a European background I don't think of circumcision as "natural" and don't consider it normal, although I do see benefits in it. I think in the absence of medical neccessity it should be the parents' and the child's decision. Probably biased by my cultural background, I don't find "tightly" circumcised penises very aesthetic, although I do agree there are prettier things than a flaccid uncircumcised piece of meat or one that looks that way when it's fully errect; but that's MY opinion and I don't have the right to judge anyone else's just because it differs. --[[User:Ashmodai|Ashmodai]] 07:44, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-::I agree with Ashmodai.  What, exactly, is there to say other than "in every society that has ever existed since the beginning of time, it has been unquestioned that parents can make medical decisions on behalf of their infant or minor children."  Any argument against circumcision along these grounds must also address earrings, tattoos, and the like.  It's a non-starter.<br/>-<br/>-::The thing you're missing is that from a legal point of view (in most countries), this decision is not "one human being [slicing off a body part] of another human being."  From a legal standpoint, in terms of the decision being made, the parent ''is'' the child.  You can argue that that's wrong, but that applies to a whole lot more than just circumcision.[[User:Nandesuka|Nandesuka]] 11:21, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-In reply to Ashmodai: "However I can understand that parents would decide to have their child circumcised if circumcision is widely practised (eg. for religious reasons) in the society it will grow up in." This argument is invalid. Female genital mutilation is widely practiced in certain cultures, so by this justification, it is also correct. As would be, say, cutting off a child's ear, if that happened to be practiced in a particular culture. The idea that it would reduce psychological problems is extremely ironic, considering that it's merely irrational fear of their child being different that would lead the parent to make such a decision in the first place, regardless of whether it's medically justified-- which in itself is a psychological problem. Besides, what business is it of other people what your penis looks like? The idea that children routinely look at each other's penises and mock them based on wether they are circumcised or not-- and furthermore that this effect is so severe as to justify a surgery to prevent it- is ludicrous beyond words.<br/>-<br/>-:In the US children are apparently expected to shower together and since children are generally assholes about people being different, I think it's a pretty realistic assumption that it's one more thing they can mock about. Whatever advice the parents can give ("Just don't react and they'll get bored") doesn't help, because children are irrational and having someone to make fun of is considered fun until some point past puberty.<br/>-:It has nothing to do with female circumcision. This is a common mistake, probably caused by the similar term. Female circumcision strongly affects the sensitivity of female genitalia and reduces the ability to lead a normal sex life. Cutting off an ear causes other problems (the ear drums are less protected, etc). Both practices have no practical benefits. Cutting off an arm or a leg would be even worse.<br/>-:Male circumcision merely removes a part of the foreskin. Some people have very long or tight foreskins where such an operation becomes a medical neccessity, often it is not. I don't think the medical benefits are high enough to justify a routine, but there is no rational way this can be perceived as an entirely harmful operation. The cut heals off quickly and the glans adapts to the increased stimuli quickly. I haven't heard of many adults who reported a loss of sexual sensitivity in the glans, tho, and amazingly enough the wide number of people demonising circumcision are either uncircumcised or have been circumcised before becoming sexually active (either as an infant, eg. in a routine procedure, or as a child, eg. for religious reasons).<br/>-:Also please refrain from using the term "mutilation", I already explained that every surgical operation is "mutilation" in the legislative sense. --[[User:Ashmodai|Ashmodai]] 04:54, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-In reply to Nandesuka: "In every society that has ever existed since the beginning of time, it has been unquestioned that parents can make medical decisions on behalf of their infant or minor children." Are you also arguing that a parent should be allowed to remove all of a child's teeth to prevent them from ever getting cavities? Even though one could claim it's a "medical" decision, the key factor is wether such a "medical" decision is justified and in the best interest of the child. The evidence that circumsision is actually beneficial is extremely controversial. Your claim that the "parent 'is' the child" in the eyes of the law is without foundation-- as an adult can legally decide to have all their teeth pulled just for fun, but a parent cannot decide to have all their child's teeth pulled with the sole justification of preventing cavities. It's illegal in all civilized nations. In other words, parents cannot make a medical decision on behalf of their child that is not CLEARLY beneficial and/or necessary. Why is circumcision the SOLE exception to this rule? (And besides that, what is or is not currently legal in any particular place has no bearing on wether it *should* be legal.)<br/>-:Did you know that anti-circumcision campaigns would be a lot more successful if they were more diplomatic? Eh. Anyway.<br/>-:The factor is not whether it is strictly beneficial, but whether it causes no harm. Piercing the ears for earrings isn't beneficial in any sense, but it is not known to cause any rational harm. The problem with male circumcision, in this sense, is that there is no scientifically, rationally, proven harm in it. Instead of villifying it, maybe you should concentrate more on unbiased research. The medical harm is outweighed by the medical benefits, the sociological harm is non-existant in the countries where it is a routine procedure and the pracitcal harm has not been proven in unbiased research. You are seriously lacking arguments here. --[[User:Ashmodai|Ashmodai]] 04:54, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-==Evidence of the sexual effects of circumcision==<br/>-<br/>-Robert has every right to correct things that are not true or inaccurate or distorted.

Your source for this is:<br/>-:The cervical cancer epidemic that screening has prevented in the UK<br/>-:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=15262102<br/>-- [[User:Robert the Bruce|Robert the Bruce]] 04:00, 28 Oct 2004 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-Dear Robert, I "failed" to "include" the influence of screening on the death rates from cervical cancer, because it was already in the article!  I quote:<br/>-:...scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine found that had it not been for effective cervical screening fully one in 65 of all British women born since 1950 would have died from cancer of the cervix.<br/>-What I did was to add the death rates from cervical cancer. The very thing you accused me of failing to include was in the article all that time.<br/>-<br/>-So why is it important to include the information about death rates? The answer can be found in the abstract that Robert noted above. I quote:<br/>-:BACKGROUND: Recent reports suggest that the reduction in mortality achieved by the UK national cervical screening programme is too small to justify its financial and psychosocial costs, except perhaps in a few high-risk women.<br/>-Clearly, this abstract has to be understood in the light of a controversy over funding the cervical cancer screening program. You see, the death rates from cervical cancer were small enough for some bean counters to argue that the screening program didn't make a great difference to overall death rates. The figures that I quoted help to explain why that argument might arise.<br/>-<br/>-There is another reason for including the overall death rates from cervical cancer. The article implies that Great Britain has suffered an epidemic of  cervical cancer because of a lack of circumcision. By including the cervical cancer death rates of Britain and the United States, readers can judge for themselves how much difference it might make:<br/>-:In 2000, cervical cancer deaths in Great Britain were 3.9 per 100,000.(USA, 3.3; Canada, 2.8; Australia, 2.4.) [http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/c/cervical_cancer/deaths.htm]<br/>-<br/>-Once again, I suggest that Robert has failed to demonstrate how adding this information to what was already in the article is telling a half-truth. I contend that deliberately removing this information is the action of someone who prefers to dodge part of the picture for narrow ideological reasons. [[User:Michael Glass|Michael Glass]] 14:09, 28 Oct 2004 (UTC)<br/>-*You have every right to suggest what you may but that does not change the situation one iota in that you are deliberately attempting to sell a half truth here. The death rate from cervical cancer has absolutely no bearing on the article as it is only the end result of a process which can largely be avoided through screening. Anyone who understands a jot about the great circumcision debate will know that your single intention is insinuate that "risk" to partners of both circumcised and uncircumcised men is about the same. This is clearly not so. Do the math as far as the UK is concerned and put a cost on the whole situation at GB pounds 36,000 per life saved.

As health is worse amongst non-whites and the less well educated in America, this could have influenced the above findings.<br/>-<br/>-Healthy men are likely to have fewer sexual dysfunctions than men who are less healthy. Some illnesses are known to affect sexual function, including circulatory diseases, diabetes and depression, and all these diseases are more prevalent in less advantaged communities.

[[User:Michael Glass|Michael Glass]] 23:05, 30 Oct 2004 (UTC)<br/>-*Michael I have responded to you on this (below) in some detail. The problem is that the use of Winkelmann as a source of foreskin friendly information is somewhat less tha honest because he did not state what you want to present him as having stated. (Does this sort of detail bother you?) And secondly that Taylor stuff is pure speculation. I suggest it is prudent to delete all reference to Taylor until there has been some independent finding which support the conclusions he leapt to after looking at some skins form cadavers under a microscope. We need to remember we are working on an encyclopaedia here and not a publicity brochure for the anti-circumcision movement. The need for honesty and accuracy is clearly much higher here at Wikipedia. Please respect that. - [[User:Robert the Bruce|Robert the Bruce]] 03:02, 31 Oct 2004 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-Robert, please don’t lecture me on honesty. I have not found your words particularly honest or reliable. You just said "Taylor’s stuff is pure speculation." However,  you disprove this when you reveal that he examined cadavers! A link to one of Taylor’s articles, e.g., The Prepuce [http://www.cirp.org/library/anatomy/cold-taylor/]  would enable readers to check what he wrote and make up their own minds.

He cuts out a second paragraph, removing the findings of Winlelmann and Taylor as well. Could Robert  explain whether this was carelessness or deceit? Either way, a misleading description of an edit is unacceptable. [[User:Michael Glass|Michael Glass]] 23:05, 30 Oct 2004 (UTC)<br/>-*The problem is your selective approach to this subject. You want to closely examine what Moses stated but you just want to keep a sound bite from Winkelmann. By introducing such information you kind of open a "Pandora's box" where if is difficult to know where to begin and where to end. That is where the POV comes in. For example you want to include a soundbite that a person named Winkelmann included the foreskin in his study of erogenous zones you need to explain the differences in function between Meissner and Vater-Pacini corpuscles and explain that Winkelmann also included the oral cavity, conjunctival region, the perianal region and the lip. And then we need to explain that the enervation of the foreskin is closer to that of the oral cavity than the clitoris or the glans penis. I mean how far do you want to go with this Michael? The one thing for certain is that it will lead to your anti-circumcision deceit about the sexual function be debunked once and for all and all that will remain will be the psychosexual aspects (such as foreskin fetishism) but no scientific or anatomical evidence to prove your case. So if you want to include something along the lines in the now "suspended" (rather than deleted) paragraph why not work it out here before trying to reinsert nonsense into the body of the article. BTW, have you noticed how nicely the [[Foreskin fetish]] article is starting to take shape? But boy has it touched some nerves in the process. Would you like to bring your expertise to that party? - [[User:Robert the Bruce|Robert the Bruce]] 02:53, 31 Oct 2004 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-Robert, if you want to object to the Winkelmann and Taylor studies so be it. I will be interested to consider why you feel these references are a problem. In fairness to the reader, there should be links to the relevant studies such as Cold & McGrath's paper [http://www.cirp.org/library/anatomy/cold-mcgrath/] so that the readers can easily go to these studies and judge for themselves. What I objected to is your misleading description of  your edit. <br/>-<br/>-You described your move as ‘suspending’ these words. This is mendacious. You deleted them. You deleted them and you described your edit as deleting something else. This is not an honest description of what you did. "Deceitful" could be a word to describe it.<br/>-<br/>-As for the question of a foreskin fetish, I believe that you may know something about this. Someone who would write about the "long juicy anteater of a foreskin" may well have something to say about this subject. However, there is also the evidence of a sexual involvement in circumcision that also has to be considered, such as Williamson and Williamson’s "the circumcised penis exists in exposed beauty whether flaccid or erect." [http://www.geocities.com/HotSprings/2754/womenpref.html] Circumcision Fetishism could also be a suitable topic for Wikipedia.

In their view the benefits of neonatal circumcision (including a lower rate of urinary tract infection in infants, a lower rate of penile cancer in adults, and a lower rate of infection of some sexually transmitted diseases, particularly HIV) do not significantly outweigh the risks (including bleeding, infection, surgical mishap, and rarely death).<br/>-In my opinion the sentence accurately summarized the policy statements of the professional medical organizations.<br/>-<br/>-Also the introduction includes a short quote from the policy statements of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia and the American Academy of Pediatrics. In my opinion these two statements accurately represent the range of opinions of professional medical organizations.  The BC statement is the strongest in terms of saying infant circumcision is not medically necessary and the AAP statement is the weakest.  However a contributor with a pro-circumcision POV repeatedly deletes the statement by the College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia. -- [[User:DanBlackham|DanBlackham]] 10:51, 30 Oct 2004 (UTC)<br/>-*What dispute? You are pushing your POV and I am attempting to maintain a NPOV approach to this subject. The title of the article is [[Medical analysis of circumcision]] of which policy statements by medical bodies are but a component and not the be all and end all. If one were to include such a statement in the introduction (which I reluctantly agree with) one will do from the most influencial of such bodies. Where on earth does the BC statement suddenly deserve centre stage treatment? (unless of course it is closest to your POV). Why don't you insert links to such statements?

The statements by professional medical organizations are the best neutral point of view summaries of the medical analysis of circumcision.  They all say there is no medical indication for infant circumcision.  Not one of the professional medical organizations says the small potential medical benefits of infant circumcision far outweigh the medical risks and harms, not one, not even the American Academy of Pediatrics.  The Royal Australasian College of Physicians statement says, "Review of the literature in relation to risks and benefits shows there is no evidence of benefit outweighing harm for circumcision as a routine procedure." -- [[User:DanBlackham|DanBlackham]] 11:55, 30 Oct 2004 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-I disagree with the wording of the above. While a few (one?) medical organisations have explicitly stated that benefits do not outweigh harms, I don't think it's appropriate for us to speak for those that haven't stated a policy on that matter. The AAP's statement also merely says that there are benefits and risks, and parents should make the decision (implicitly disagreeing with your wording). I propose the following milder (and thus more generally true) statement (emphasis added):<br/>-: In their view the benefits of neonatal circumcision (including a lower rate of urinary tract infection in infants, a lower rate of penile cancer in adults, and a lower rate of infection of some sexually transmitted diseases, particularly HIV) do not ''sufficiently'' outweigh the risks (including bleeding, infection, surgical mishap, and rarely death) ''to recommend that all males be circumcised''. - [[User:Jakew|Jakew]] 12:45, 30 Oct 2004 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-Some of the medical organizations have taken a much stronger stand, for example:<br/>-*"The possibility that routine circumcision may contravene human rights has been raised because circumcision is performed on a minor and is without proven medical benefit." -- The Royal Australasian College of Physicians.

However, only the American Pediatric Society's policy is cited. This causes the article to lead off with a US-centric viewpoint, affecting the POV.

Robert, please stop deleting them.  Dr. Taylor found the ridged band of the foreskin has a high concentration of specialized nerves.

But you do realise that your point of view (POV) does not deserve centre stage attention unless it is backed up by credible fact. Sadly this piece misrepresents Winkelmann and Taylor's two-page excuse for a study is an outstanding example of irresponsible speculation being taken for serious science by desperate people. Hammond showed us that at least half of foreskin restorers have a mental pathology of sorts, 30% are serious substance abusers and these sad and desperate people are being exploited by an anti-circumcision movement for their own purposes. Disgraceful actually. If you are desperate to include Winkelmann then you need to point out the difference between the Meissner and Vater Pacini corpusles both in terms of location and function. So please try to keep your eye on the ball here. Because "in your POV" you believe that something should be included in the article does not necessarily mean it has the required merit. Try your best to strive for NPOV and not just recklessly push your anti-circumcision agenda. It is not helpful. - [[User:Robert the Bruce|Robert the Bruce]] 17:44, 1 Nov 2004 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-Robert, please stop your ad hominem attacks.  Dr. Taylor's article is an accurate description of the cellular anatomy of the foreskin.[http://www.cirp.org/library/anatomy/taylor/]  He found that an intact male's foreskin has a high concentration of specialized nerve cells. That is a scientific fact and it should be included in the article, even though it does not agree with your pro-circumcision agenda. -- [[User:DanBlackham|DanBlackham]] 08:41, 3 Nov 2004 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-:Actually, describing them as specialised is deceptive. What he found was that a certain part of the foreskin (the ridged band of mucosa) was comparatively rich in Meissner corpuscles. They're no more specialised than any other nerve cell. It's true that later Taylor did ''speculate'' that these were specialised tissue, but this was pure speculation with no basis in fact. Saying that the ridged band of the foreskin is comparatively rich in superficial touch receptors is apparently factual, but I'm afraid that any poetic essays about specialised receptors inducing sexual ecstacy (etc.) must be considered junk and treated accordingly. - [[User:Jakew|Jakew]] 11:54, 3 Nov 2004 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-Describing Meissner's corpuscles as specialized nerve cells is not deceptive; it is an accurate statement.  Meissner's corpuscles are especially effective in detecting light touch.  As you said Dr. Taylor found that there is a high concentration of Meissner's corpuscles in the ridged band of the foreskin.  There is also a high concentration of Meissner's corpuscles in the fingertips, lips, and nipples.  Most people know from their own personal experience that their fingertips, lips, and nipples are more sensitive to light touch than most other parts of their body.  Robert's attempt to delete Dr. Taylor's findings that the foreskin contains a high concentration of specialized nerves, called Meissner's corpuscles, which are effective in detecting light touch is deceptive and is an unacceptable attempt to insert his own pro-circumcision POV in the article. -- [[User:DanBlackham|DanBlackham]] 23:54, 5 Nov 2004 (UTC)<br/>-*Sorry DanB but the deception comes in through the suggestion that the because of the presence of "specialised nerves" the foreskin therefore has a sexual function. Meissner corpuscles are indeed "specialised nerves" and are found in such places as the oral cavity, the lips, the finger tips, the palms and the soles of the feet ... and the foreskin (and not the nipple as you suggest - see the Areola and Nipple section of [http://www.cirp.org/library/anatomy/winkelmann/ Winkelmann] - was this deliberate or just a slip?).

In their view the potential medical benefits of neonatal circumcision (including a lower rate of urinary tract infection in infants, a lower rate of penile cancer in adults, and a lower rate of infection of some sexually transmitted diseases, particularly HIV) do not significantly outweigh the potential medical risks (including bleeding, infection, surgical mishap, and rarely death).<br/>-Every medical analysis of circumcision by professional medical organizations has concluded that '''neo-natal circumcision is NOT medically necessary'''. -- [[User:DanBlackham|DanBlackham]] 08:03, 2 Dec 2004 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-Hi Dan: Yes, I agree, the section on complications and the cost-benefit section are essential. I accept the introduction you propose. The present quotation from the AAP statemen should be deleted because that statement is outmoded, inaccurate, does not agree with current bioethics thought, and is not in agreement with statements from the Canadian Paediatric Society and the Royal Australasian College of Physicians and Surgeons.

On a side-note, does anyone actually say that it is medically neccessary?--[[User:Yoshiah ap|Josiah]] 03:26, Dec 3, 2004 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-No national or international professional medical organization says neonatal circumcision is medically necessary.  There has been a broad consensus in the medical community since the 1970's that there is no medical indication for circumcising baby boys.  The American Academy of Pediatrics said in 1971, "There are no valid medical indications for circumcision in the neonatal period."  The Canadian Paediatric Society reached the same conclusion in 1975.  Currently every national and international professional medical organization that has an official policy on circumcision says that neonatal circumcision is not medically necessary.  For example the Royal Australasian College of Physicians says, "After extensive review of the literature the RACP reaffirms that '''there is no medical indication for routine male circumcision'''." -- [[User:DanBlackham|DanBlackham]] 09:22, 3 Dec 2004 (UTC)<br/>-*I do not believe anyone -religous or secular - says otherwise. --[[User:Yoshiah ap|Josiah]] 21:53, Dec 7, 2004 (UTC)<br/>-Robert Blair, in my opinion it would be okay to included the quote from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) if a quote from another professional medical organization like the Royal Australasian College of Physicians (RACP) were also included.  The AAP position on non-therapeutic circumcision is the weakest of all the major national medical organizations.  Even the American Medical Association has taken a stronger stand against non-therapeutic circumcision than the AAP.

At the ''very'' least, this latter point ought to be noted, because it is relevant (think about it: how would you answer if you were an activist?). Boyle is Executive Director of the anti-circumcision activist group, ''Attorneys for the Rights of the Child'', and Gillian Bensley is a member of the anti-circ activist group NOCIRC, and has presented at one of their symposia. There is no reason not to say "psychologists and anti-circumcision activists", but to censor such facts is simply irresponsible. I recognise that as an outsider you are probably incredulous at the idea that activists could stoop so low, but believe me (if you prefer not to, I'll provide proof) that these people are making a slow but determined effort to populate the medical literature with less than credible junk such as surveys of their own members and so on. - [[User:Jakew|Jakew]] 23:55, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-<!--DanBlackham, I inserted this here as it was in response to Jakew's comment.

It has been demonstrated that newborn circumcision is much safer (one study found 0% complication rate in the neonatal group vs 30% later on).<br/>-<br/>-For deaths, he inappropriately takes the LFS value from Gairdner. As I discussed recently [see below], this is inappropriate. Neonatal circumcision <br/>-(which, after all, is the title of Van Howe's analysis) does not use general anaesthesia.<br/>-<br/>-For UTIs, he strangely relies on To's study alone, completely ignoring all other studies (both before and after).

Seems that no other body part is subjected to this style of analysis: cut a bunch of people first -- do the numbers change? -- oh, well that was the right thing to do!  That proves very little, as there is no control group, and no real science.  Opposing this methology is not insanity, and a medical analysis is not just a numbers game.  We are all involved, like it or not.  We would be missing more than our foreskins if certain doctors made decisions about what to take off.  Even the pro-genital-mutilation studies that are spread throughout Wikipedia do not disclam "Warning about Van Howe, this guy is a raving circumcision proponent, don't believe a word of it".  That has little to do with fact, and more to do with defamation and bias (they are probably public figures in this context).

[[User:DanP|DanP]] 00:38, 17 Dec 2004 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-DanP, Van Howe's paper falls into the general class of papers known as ''reviews'', or ''surveys''. These introduce no new data, but instead attempt to perform some analysis using the existing medical literature. In this case, it's a cost-utility analysis. In these days of evidence-based medicine, articles should be obtained and selected via a well-defined process that is not inherently biased. For example, one might say "I'll search Medline (a well-known database of medical papers) for circumcision, from 1980 onwards". The search strategy is usually stated, so that it can be repeated and thus verified. If one makes arbitrary selections (as Van Howe does), then one can justifiably be criticised. - [[User:Jakew|Jakew]] 01:13, 17 Dec 2004 (UTC)<br/>-:If you search any medical database on breast cancer, it's always aimed toward preserving the breast, instead of amputating as a cautionary matter of statistics or risks.  If your view that "evidence-based" medicine is appropriate, where is the evidence of foreskin disease in a newborn?  It is almost always absent.  That isn't bias, that is fact.  You've struggled to delete that fact over and over using a probabilistic and interpretation-based approach toward this matter, and <b>now</b> you say a ''well-defined'' process should exclude one that will ''perform some analysis using the existing medical literature''.  If that is the case, we should immediately purge Wikipedia of all claims of both benefit and harm from circumcision, since Wikipedia is now such a repository of re-analysis.  Isn't that correct, or did I misread the title of this article?  My only suggestion is that we mention Van Howe's work without judgement, of him or his work, except to say that the paper asserts such things.  These accusations work both ways, and numerous "circumcision benefit" links in this article are mentioned without hinting that the author is a single-issue lunatic. [[User:DanP|DanP]] 18:50, 17 Dec 2004 (UTC)<br/>-::Dan, I most certainly do not say that Van Howe's work should be excluded because it "perform(s) some analysis using the existing medical literature", and I'm sorry if I gave that impression. It is ''entirely'' valid to analyse using the existing literature, and indeed beneficial. When doing this, one ''has'' to use a well-defined approach. One can't just be arbitrary. The problem with his work is that instead of being systematic in his review of the literature, he has been selective and arbitrary (see my notes above). In itself, that would be alright (though it would make his paper appear as cranky as it really is), but the trouble is that Van Howe lies, and claims to have used a systematic approach. That's readily disproven by repeating his claimed method, and seeing the papers he chose to omit. - [[User:Jakew|Jakew]] 00:14, 18 Dec 2004 (UTC)<br/>-::: It is easy enough to say Van Howe's perspective is a lie.  Even that judgement is somewhat arbitrary in what you are willing to accept, and what you reject.  Many systematic refutations of pro-mutilation junk science are available online.  But that has never been sufficient to exclude them from Wikipedia.  Why not let the reader decide on their own?  I'm sure plenty of research is out there explaining how to save money and avoid surgery, and how to seek alternative treatment for many diseases or disorders involving non-vital organs.  Yet that same candle of truth must in no way go near the male genitals?  I have difficulty seeing the non-arbitrary systematic approach there, or how Van Howe work differs from any other less-blatantly mutilating fields of medicine.  Perhaps you can explain why this is so?  [[User:DanP|DanP]] 01:36, 29 Dec 2004 (UTC)<br/>-::::Dan, would you please realise that we're not talking about whether to delete Van Howe - we're just discussing whether to include commentary.

Do you dispute this, or should commentary only be valid from your side?  As to systematic refutation, every time CIRP article are linked, or commentary as to failures of pro-mutilation arguments are detailed, you oppose them as selective or biased.  Yet your wild rampage against Van Howe is warranted?  Why? [[User:DanP|DanP]] 23:24, 29 Dec 2004 (UTC)<br/>-::::::DanP, my "wild rampage against Van Howe" consists merely of noting that he's an anti-circumcision activist. Please keep a sense of proportion here. It's unclear what you mean by "CIRP articles" - do you mean a paper that happens to be hosted at CIRP, or do you mean one of CIRP's own discussion pages? While the latter are absurdly biased, I don't object ''too'' much to the former. My main gripes with CIRP's pages are a) their little "explanatory notes", designed to guide the reader towards their way of thinking, and b) their highlighting of passages that they like, and c) their habit of linking to only the references that support their position. If they just presented the paper as it was in the journal, I'd have no objection. -[[User:Jakew|Jakew]] 12:32, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-==A sense of proportion==<br/>-To keep a sense of proportion here one needs to remember that '''there is no medical indication for neonatal circumcision''', in other words '''neonatal circumcision is not medically necessary'''.  There is no other part of a child's body that doctors will cut off without a valid medical indication.  The College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia policy statement says:<br/>-:"Infant male circumcision was once considered a preventive health measure and was therefore adopted extensively in Western countries.  Current understanding of the benefits, risks and potential harm of this procedure, however, no longer supports this practice for prophylactic health benefit.  Routine infant male circumcision performed on a healthy infant is now considered a non-therapeutic and medically unnecessary intervention."<br/>---[[User:DanBlackham|DanBlackham]] 18:27, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)<br/>-*Thanks for that Dan. It is always nice to know that we can get an up-to-date anti-circumcision view from you.

Both sides of many ethical debates are presented in Wikipedia, the pros and the cons.  Saying "no propaganda" is fair enough.  But I believe you have tossed the first stone in nearly every instance, and our rules must apply to both sides.

The researchers concluded that ''"Prepubertal circumcision is associated with reduced HIV risk, whereas circumcision after age 20 years is not significantly protective against HIV-1 infection."''<br/>-<br/>-However, a closer reading of the source reveals that those who were circumcised at the age of 21 or more had a higher rate of infection than those who remained uncircumcised.

I posted this paragraph to clarify the position in the main article.<br/>- "It is noted that the researchers' found among those circumcised after the age of 21 years: <br/>- ''"HIV-1 prevalence was 14.1% in uncircumcised men, compared with 16.2% for men circumcised at age<br/>- > or = 21 years''. While anti-circumcision activists emphasize this fact it should be noted that in<br/>- this community, where circumcision when carried out is during adolescence, circumcision after the <br/>- age of twenty-one is most as a result of medical conditions of the foreskin and/or repetitive and/<br/>- or persistent sexually transmitted disease (STD). It is therefore likely that a significant number<br/>- of these men actually became infected with HIV while still uncircumcised."<br/>-So sadly Micheal the anti-circ line has been exposed for what it is. Now a question. If circumcision can actually reduce the number of HIV infections by millions world wide why are anti-circumcision activists, who incidentally claim to be concerned with child and human rights, so desperate to counter such findings? Is it a case that the mindset of the average anti-circumcision activist places the foreskin as more important than millions of human lives and the accompanying human tragedy that is part of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. It makes one think. - [[User:Robert the Bruce|Robert the Bruce]] 04:37, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-:Robert, this is a fine piece of invective, but it is without substance.

Most case-control and cohort studies from Africa have shown an association between a lack of circumcision and an increased risk of HIV infection in men. The evidence is conflicting, however, with cross-sectional surveys from Tanzania and Rwanda either showing no relationship or an association in the opposite direction.<br/>-<br/>-I believe it is important to point out that there is conflicting evidence about the relationship between circumcision status and incidence of HIV. This backs up what the Cochrane Library said and helps to explain where Van Howe got his raw data. In turn, this puts the reader in a better position to understand and assess the comments of Moses et al in criticising Van Howe's meta-analysis.  I originally broke the quotation into two parts: one that dealt with the conflict in the evidence and the other that dealt with the criticism of Van Howe. I think this is clearer than having one long quotation. However, I can quite understand if others felt the passage should be quoted in one block.[[User:Michael Glass|Michael Glass]] 13:51, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)<br/>-*Michael you certainly must get an "A" effort for the way that you tirelessly work towards supporting the unsupportable. Why even foreskin guru Geoffrey T. Falk (the "org" behind cirp) has reported that Van Howe himself admits that his findings are weak. I quote:<br/>- "I spoke with Bob Van Howe recently, and he agreed that there was some merit in Moses' criticism of<br/>- his meta-analysis. Some of the statistics were not as refined as they could have been. Bob is now<br/>- working on a revised analysis using the numbers from these studies. However, one must remember that<br/>- the data from these studies themselves is subject to numerous confounding factors.

I think it important that people should be aware of the flaws in Van Howe's work, and for that reason alone, we should discuss it. I'd have a great deal more respect for CIRP if they had the decency to include one of their little notes, directing readers to the relevant letters, but unfortunately they don't appear to have that much integrity. The burden of exposing the facts about circumcision - and about Van Howe - thus falls to us. - [[User:Jakew|Jakew]] 22:41, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)<br/>-:*The fact that CIRP continues to display the trash on its website says all that needs to be said about the lack of integrity of that organisation ... but it goes further ... what does it say about the integrity of those POV warriors that continue to relentlessly present this Van Howe trash as being a scientific counter to the ever mounting evidence of the relationship between the lack of circumcision and a higher risk of HIV infection among the uncircumcised and their partners?

If his meat-analysis is flawed, then there are two ways of dealing with this issue. One is to discuss it and the criticisms; another is to remove all discussion of that particular study. It would all depend on the influence that the Van Howe article has had. If it was particularly well-known and influential, then it is better to include information about it, including the flaws that people have detected in it.<br/>-<br/>-However, I have a great problem with your latest edit to the section on HIV/AIDS. Under the excuse of removing clutter you have suppressed evidence that is not to your liking and skewed the whole section towards your own point of view. The version that you mutilated was something that both Jake Waskett and I felt reasonably comfortable with. Now you have turned it into a propaganda piece once more. This is not a positive contribution to  the article. [[User:Michael Glass|Michael Glass]] 09:10, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)<br/>-*Michael, of course you will not be in agreement with much that is written on this subject. Walabio has identified you as a "full time intactivist" [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Robert_the_Bruce/Vigilance] and as such you are totally anti-circumcision POV. Now we (who follow the circumcision debate) know just how desperately anti-circumcision activists are to break or discredit the link between the lack of circumcision and a higher risk of HIV infection for the uncircumcised and their wives partners. We also know how apoplectic they are at the thought of the RCT's confirming this protective effect. Michael, I know all this is bad for the foreskin but it does not mean that you or other foreskin promoters should be allowed to fill such articles with anti-circumcision propaganda. As to Van Howe, it is now clear that you are aware of Van Howe himself admitting that his research was fatally flawed. The fact that anti-circumcision websites continue to present it as credible is an absolute disgrace. As far as Wikipedia is concerned any attempt to reinsert this trash should be treated as a wikicrime. (I thought you should know this). Now onto your final point. I can sympathise that the current state of the article is not in agreement of your POV but that of course does not mean that the content is wrong, inaccurate or a lie. What would you like me to add? Would you like me to add the fact as to just how desperate anti-circumcision activists are to discredit the foreskin/HIV link.

If you label a sweeping round of deletions "POV" you need to be able to explain every single one of them.<br/>-::I'm not going to revert though, as I think your placement of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians and he USAID office's statements makes the article sound better.

I'd really like a citation from some kind of respected publication that suggests that the O'Hara and the Bensley/Boyle studies are too bogus to be included in any form. I think that, if the results are disputed, NPOV policy would certainly require us putting up the disputes (so long as they come from some credible source, and especially so long as they are at least mentioned in the links we use as our own citations), but you need evidence that the peer-reviewed, respected journals were completely off base in publishing the authors before you can simply exclude their research.

It gives weight to views that are more credible than others. In scientific articles, this generally refers to peer-reviewed publications. For precisely this reason I believe that the O'Hare article and others ought to remain in the article. Also for this reason, I am beginning to be sceptical that criticism of the article should be included, since the only criticism that has been presented so far is a letter by an author in a post-publication review (i.e. not in a published article). &mdash; [[User:Asbestos|Asbestos]] | [[User talk:Asbestos|Talk]] 01:56, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC) (formatting fixed - Jakew)<br/>-:::Let me get this straight: you're suggesting censoring the fact that legitimate criticisms have been raised on the flimsy grounds that although the letter has been published, it hasn't been printed? - [[User:Jakew|Jakew]] 02:11, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)<br/>-::::[[User_talk:Asbestos#Medical_analysis_of_circumcision|Here]] you suggested censoring a legitamate article on the flimsy grounds that someone wrote a letter about it.

I suggested removing it on the grounds that it was atrocious. '''Many''' people have criticised it - I have simply offered some examples in the literature or in print (Brian Morris counts in this regard, as his site is a condensed version of his book). You insist, rather unreasonably in my view, that the article remains. I say this is tolerable, but must be accompanied by criticism. You then '''demanded''' sources for criticism. When I provided sources, you '''quibble''' about whether or not they are in the form of pixels or ink!

The title of this article is "''Medical analysis'' of circumcision", not people's opinions on it, so I think asking for legitamate sources is a pefectly reasonable thing to do. I've already stated that you're attacking a strawman when you start talking about pixels or ink &mdash; I've never said anything remotely like that &mdash; but surely a reasonable person like you recognizes post-publication forums as a place to express opinions, not to write respected research. You keep talking about this huge body of literature attacking O'Hara and attacking Bensley and Boyle. I'm sure this exists, and will cheerfully recant everything when you show me something respectable, but surely you see that a letter by someone, who may or may not have his own POV, hardly gets the same weight in the scientific community as a published article. &mdash; [[User:Asbestos|Asbestos]] | [[User talk:Asbestos|Talk]] 10:16, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)<br/>-::Well, ok, you want "medical analysis", so why are you objecting to criticism from Edgar Schoen MD, Professor of Pediatrics and 1989 Chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Task Force on Circumcision?

Secondly, the journal ''Pediatrics'' defines the P3Rs (which are the online letters we're talking about) as: "Post-publication Peer Review (P3R) is an online forum for ongoing peer review." So are you now saying that peer review is invalid? Should we perhaps demand copies of the draft versions of articles, to avoid the influence of those pesky reviewers? Finally, yes I agree that a letter may express an opinion, even a POV, but we're not making a bold claim about, say, circumcision preventing heart disease or world famine - we're just saying that a "study" has been criticised.

You understand that I was taken aback, however, to discover that there was ''no'' published rebuttal to O'Hara, and the best you've come up with is a random aside in someone's letter. You and RtB were for deleting the study on almost no grounds at all. The second citation, btw, is absolutely irrelevant. It has one sentence which may or may not refer to O'Hara (she is never mentioned by name anywhere), doesn't back it up in any way, and really does not appear to be from a particularly neutral source.

I object to the use of the non-dictionary term "circumcisionist", and for the fact that other critics (included in previous versions) have been omitted. I also object to the fact that criticism of Bensley and Boyle has been removed.

Somewhere there are Wikipedia guidelines on this, I'm sure.  But clearly there are some (Morris, O'Hara) that can be described as advocates or opponents, whereas others who merely profess a viewpoint need not be classified as driven by single-issues if their disciplines are broader.  As an example, to an outside observer, we all probably seem like single-issue nutcases.  But then take into account that there is disagreement, not necessarily personal interest, that raises the bar.  Get a bunch of nerds arguing about the phasers on Star Trek, same thing.  So I propose that we preface a name as "opponent of cirucumcision X"," "circumcision advocate Y", etc. only when the person is actually described that way in some news or academic publication.  Otherwise, if applicable, we should use their a professional title (author, professor, etc.) and not make our own value judgements. [[User:DanP|DanP]] 10:52, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)<br/>-:::Agreed. Since the terms "anti-circumcision activist so-and-so" and "pro-mutilation activist so-and-so" are clearly opinions (and the latter obviously slander), we should only give weight to such classifications if they are used in respected media. Using one pro/ant-circumcision website to prove that someone else is an "activist" doesn't count as respected media.

Journals require contributors to declare relevant interests, which they make available to readers. I think we should do the same, but should be more cautious about it. There's no reason to declare that ''every'' author of an 'anti-circ' paper is an anti-circ activist (though a worryingly large proportion do seem to be), and it dilutes the impact of revealing that some are. The same should obviously go for pro-circ, though here the organised nature of anti-circ activism counts against it.

Then you should look at other considerations such as cultural and political points of view.  I think there is a balance that can be found here if people are really interested in producing a high quality article.  I don't normally introduce myself this way but since it's very ''a propos'' in this case: I am an adult ''uncircumcised'' male resident in Canada.  There, nobody can accuse me of not admitting my bias, now back to the topic at hand.  Here is my brief interpretation of the current academic and medical view of circumcision:<br/>-<br/>-Essentially as numerous people have noted there is no medical evidence that circumcision has any statistically significant benefits to the individual in question, nor is there any solid evidence that it does any great harm when performed during the neonatal period.  In essence what most doctors, who don't have an axe to grind, will tell you is that all things being equal there is no need for circumcision any more than there is to pierce a baby girl's (or boy's for that matter) ears.  On the flipside there is probably not much more risk unless you start to tread into more subjective interpretations of the facts.  That said, there is a fairly solid consensus that if the parents wish for their son to be circumcised then there is little reason to refuse this procedure either.  Ultimately this is a sensitive issue that, in the vast majority of cases, is based in a family's cultural and social traditions.  I have yet to read a single reputable source suggesting that Muslim or Jewish parents should be denied the "right" to have their son's circumcised, in fact many doctors and psychologists have suggested that there are non-medical factors that would support circumcision in these cases as it is primarily practiced in these cultures as a form of initiation into the community, a common practice in all cultures even though the means differs.<br/>-<br/>-In my opinion this is where 99% of the conversation breaks down.  Most people feel threatened when they discuss this issue since as men they will already fall into one of the two categories (in all but a few rare circumstances) as somebody has already pointed out.  Women will also have a bias though in my opinion, by definition it will be somewhat more detached than the male point of view tends to be for obvious reasons, though often just as strongly held.  The simple fact of the matter is that circumcision was not routinely practiced in Western Europe or North America as a prophylactic procedure until the last 100 years or so and it was begun based on the best medical undertanding at the time which suggested that it would prevent various "conditions" such as masturbation, infection and certain sexual dysfunction and illness.  None of these "medical" rationales have been borne out by modern medical practice, research or consensus, however we now live in a culture where circumcision is consdered traditional.  The question of whether to circumcise or not is rarely a question of reasoned interpretation of the medical evidence or consultation with a medical professional qualified to advise on the topic and I really wish that people would get off their high horses and just admit this fact.<br/>-<br/>-"Medical analysis of circumcision" is fairly straightforward, there is no strong view one way or the other, the decision to circumcise is ultimately a family decision barring new research to the contrary.  Even the official statements of the various medical associations are couched in very neutral terms, while refuting the medical ''necessity'' of circumcision they also are careful not to suggest that circumcision should be banned and IMO they likely never will.  You will likely find a majority of doctors who would lean away from circumcision simply because most doctors are loathe to perform any procedure that is not necessary in a clincal sense, but I doubt that you're gonna find many doctors who will refuse to perform (or arrange for, if they are not experienced or ethically comfortable with) circumcisions if it's the preference of the parents.  The bulk of this debate should be dumped into an article called "cultural, religious and ethical implications of circumcision" or something of the sort.  That is assuming that people actually want to make this encyclopaedia a strong resource.  Feel free to completely disregard me if you want, I have an axe to grind here because I get so pissed when I see people refusing to debate this topic honestly, admitting their biases  and seperating them from the facts.  There's nothing wrong with biases, just admit them and don't force people to share them. [[User:Gabriel|Gabe]] 02:01, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-:Gabe's summary, which I read with interest,  says that circumcision essentially makes no difference, so it's no problem for parents to make such a choice for their boys. While this sounds fair enough, people on both sides of the debate would beg to differ on such questions as whether or not circumcision reduces the incidence of certain diseases or if it affects sexual sansitivity. Therefore, when parents or religious communities have or claim the right to circumcise infants and children it throws up some thorny ethical dilemmas.<br/>-<br/>-:For instance, all genital surgery on girls is prohibited but genital surgery on boys is permitted. How can this discrepancy be justified in an era of equal rights under the law?<br/>-<br/>-:If parents decide to have a child circumcised and the boy disagrees with their choice, can he sue the parents and the doctor?<br/>-<br/>-:If parents disagree on circumcision, whose opinion shall prevail, the one who wants to circumcise or the one who does not?<br/>-<br/>-: If parents agree on circumcision, does a medical practitioner have the right to refuse to do it?<br/>-<br/>-: I have the feeling that this whole area is likely to be very contentious for many years to come.[[User:Michael Glass|Michael Glass]] 11:43, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-== Temp ==<br/>-<br/>-I copied the article to [[Medical analysis of circumcision/temp]]. &mdash;[[User:Ashley Y|Ashley Y]] 00:26, 2005 Feb 21 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-==The the==<br/>-At some point, can someone fix the "the the" typo in the ''Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and Cervical cancer'' section. -- [[User:John Fader|John Fader]] 02:24, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-== Ad Hominem qualifications ==<br/>-<br/>-Is it acceptable to qualify researchers as "anti-circumcision activists"?

Indeed, most journals require these to be stated when an article is submitted (unfortunately, this is usually limited to financial interests; the requirement is rarely rigourous enough to demand statement of membership in activist groups, despite the fact that belief in a cause is often a more powerful motivator). Do you think that the journals are indulging in ad hominem attacks?<br/>-<br/>-:I suspect (though I don't know for sure) that this requirement arose as a result of the appalling behaviour of some researchers investigating the effects of tobacco. I'm sure you remember the 'studies' (that just happened to be funded by tobacco giants) that showed tobacco was harmless or even beneficial to health?<br/>-<br/>-:We can't say "these researchers are lying activist scum", for obvious reasons. But we can - and should - note their competing interests. Readers can form their own conclusions. And yes, that applies to tobacco research, too. - [[User:Jakew|Jakew]] 11:51, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-::It is quite appropriate for journals to require disclosure of financial and only financial interests. Indeed, the word "interest" usually refers to some way of gaining by a conclusion other than the pursuit of truth. This isn't the case for "activists" (unless paid), unless you're suggesting that anti-circumcision activists secretly believe that circumcision isn't so bad after all.<br/>-<br/>-::I am disturbed that someone might study circumcision, come to a particular medical conclusion, advocate based on ordinary medical ethics applied to that conclusion, and then be qualified as an "activist" on that basis.

I would certainly join you in opposing labelling an author as an activist on that basis.

Policy Statement On Circumcision. Sep 2002.<br/>-::::::Usually doctors only perform surgery on children when the medical benefits of the surgery far outweigh the medical risks and harms.  Non-therapeutic circumcision does not even come close to meeting that standard of care.

It is one thing to say that something is not necessary, but quite another to distort the evidence to create mythical harms. It is telling that policies of many (from the AAP's to the BMA's) med. orgs have been criticised from people on both 'sides' for being too wishy-washy. Is a more-or-less neutral statement enough to create an activist? It seems unlikely. Some anti-circers have gone so far as to call the AAP hypocritical or even liable for negligence - it seems hardly as though they are inspired by that same body! - [[User:Jakew|Jakew]] 17:24, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-:::::::::Jake it is '''your''' point of view that the harms caused by circumcision are mythical.  Other reasonable people disagree with your point of view.  They feel that '''cutting off a normal, healthy part of a child's body without a valid medical indication by definition causes harm'''. -- [[User:DanBlackham|DanBlackham]] 08:22, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-::::::::::On the contrary, there is a real (yet miniscule) risk of harms such as major complications. Unfortunately, the definition of "harm" to which you refer begs the question. Still, the matter being discussed is not what ''I'' think, nor what these people think, but is instead what the medical organisations think. Right? - [[User:Jakew|Jakew]] 14:04, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-:::::::::I think this is a good example of how cultural distorts the medical analysis of circumcision.

I find this quite remarkable. Many things other than money motivate people. A number of terrorists voluntarily lost their lives in a notorious incident that I'm sure I don't need to name. Were they paid? Unlikely (of couse we can hardly ask them) - they passionately believed that they were doing the right thing. Money is not the only motivator.<br/>-<br/>-::::This is obviously irrelevant.

So should we mention the religions of the researchers, where known, if those religions have a teaching on circumcision?

There's some debate over whether this applies to Christians - some point to Paul's declaration that it is not a requirement, though others question his authority over the matter. Although the Koran doesn't strictly require circumcision, it does mandate cleanliness for prayer (which circumcision certainly facilitates), and there is the matter of emulating Mohammed (which I won't pretend to understand to the point of being able to explain). All three of these religions disapprove (at least officially) of dishonesty or deception.<br/>-<br/>-::::::In light of this, it would seem reasonable to mention the author's religion if he or she were writing about circumcision for religious reasons, but would seem rather irrelevant if writing about medical grounds. - [[User:Jakew|Jakew]] 17:24, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-:::In terms of anti-circumcision activists, they passionately believe in stopping circumcision. There can be many underlying motivations for this - some believe it unethical, some have religious objections, some just 'like' foreskin, etc. - but the purpose is clear. Now suppose an activist is writing a paper. Isn't he going to want circumcision to look bad? Might he not be tempted to exaggerate any finding in that direction a teeny bit? Might he not be tempted to gloss over any findings to the contrary? - [[User:Jakew|Jakew]] 12:29, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-::::If there is evidence of some motivation other than pursuit of truth, that should be mentioned. Since someone can be an activist merely on the basis of their reading of the scientific evidence, as I believe in fact most anti-circumcision activists are, qualifying them as "activists", even when true, serves only as POV disparagement. &mdash;[[User:Ashley Y|Ashley Y]] 23:49, 2005 Mar 15 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-:::::I think your belief is touching, Ashley, but mistaken. As I have explained previously, the bulk of the evidence can be said to be "in favour" of the procedure (though strictly speaking, science should be value-free, with only interpretation making a judgment). I can understand that having read a site like cirp.org, you might believe that, but remember that cirp generally only includes articles "opposing" circumcision.

Now the first question is why was he reading about circumcision in the first place? He must have had an interest in the subject in order to read about it. What was Tim Hammond - a massage therapist if I recall correctly - reading medical studies about circumcision for? What possible reason could there be? What evidence could he have read that could possibly have motivated him to found NOHARMM? (Remember, this was in the days before CIRP had painstakingly found every paper that could conceivably be used to oppose circ)<br/>-<br/>-:::::You're incorrect, by the way, that reading evidence makes someone an activist. Nor is writing a paper necessarily an activist act. To use the term so freely would devalue it. Membership of an activist organisation, especially playing a prominent role (such as presenting at activist conferences) is evidence of activism. Good examples would be Van Howe's presentation at the "Strategies for Intactivists" conference, or Taylor's presentation at a NOCIRC symposia.<br/>-<br/>-::::::No Jake, the bulk of the evidence is '''not''' "in favour" of the procedure.  No professional medical organization in the world agrees with your pro-circumcision point of view. For example: "Infant male circumcision was once considered a preventive health measure and was therefore adopted extensively in Western countries.  Current understanding of the benefits, risks and potential harm of this procedure, however, no longer supports this practice for prophylactic health benefit.  Routine infant male circumcision performed on a healthy infant is now considered a non-therapeutic and medically unnecessary intervention." -- College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia.

The vast majority of Christians accept the decision of the apostles and elders at the First Council of Jerusalem that circumcision is not a religious requirement for Christians.  You are correct that much of the Bible is contradictory, however the Book of Acts chapter 15 is extremely straight forward and easy to understand.

This is indeed what it said. Nevertheless, such studies can provide information that is worth following up:<br/>-<br/>-:Ecological studies <br/>-<br/>-:Ecological studies are also weak designs. Here the units of study are populations rather than individuals. Foe example, when the coronary artery disease (CAD) prevalence rates were compared between different countries. it was found that CAD miss were highest in those countries where mean serum cholesterol values were the highest. CAD rates were very low in countries like Japan (low mean serum cholesterol) while it was very high in countries like Finland (high mean serum cholesterol). This ecological link paved the way for intensive investigation into the association between serum cholesterol and CAD. Another example is the ecological link between malaria incidence and prevalence of sickle cell disease: malaria is rare in areas where sickel cell disease was prevalent. The association between smoking and lung cancer was supported by the ecological link between smoking and gender (males had higher lung cancer rates). Ecological studies can be useful in generating hypothesis but no causal inference can be drawn from them; an apparent ecological link may not be a true link, it could be confounded by several other factors.<br/>-<br/>-[[User:Michael Glass|Michael Glass]] 30 June 2005 03:01 (UTC)<br/>+<div class="messagebox standard-talk" style="width:100%;"> [[Image:Octagon-warning.svg|30px|left]] <big>'''Blocked'''</big><br clear="all" /> '''''You have been [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocked]]''''' for removing warnings from your talk page for one day.

Such as the addition of Forward-B moves, full 4-directional Smashing, side-step, dodge, etc.  And then I was also wondering if we should make a section within the moves area for a pseudo-moves section for things such as wave-dashing and DI.  These moves are real and very legitimate moves used by most players of the game today, but never officially mentioned as part of technique listings for skill in the game, along with skills such as Teching and L-Cancelling.

It is equaly unlikely that they will take out a character that has represented their series/subseries in a previous Smash.  Despite all this though, it is a trailer, which means it does not necessarily represent actual gameplay.  I can guarentee, though, that Yoshi is in.

For instance, the [[United States]] never formally declared war on Iraq (which under the [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]] could only be done by [[U.S. Congress|Congress]]; the last time that Congress made a formal [[declaration of war]] was for [[World War II]]). In international law{{ref|hagueconvention}} however, an ultimatum is considered equal to a proper declaration. Formal declaration or not, Iraq was nevertheless [[Invasion|invaded]] by U.S. military forces. The term ''Iraq war'' is often left uncapitalized to indicate the legal informality and the lack of clarity in distinguishing among various operations and violent episodes. Further definition of the term varies with usage and point of view; hence, depending on the context, the term 'Iraq War' or 'Iraq war' may refer to hostilities in Iraq that fit one of two general contexts:<br/>-[[Multinational force in Iraq|multinational forces]]"{{fn|3}} invasion of March 2003, and the three-week period of full-scale military hostilities between the multinational forces against the ''established, uniformed military forces'' (that is, Saddam Hussein's "old" Iraqi Army). According to this view, the "War" ended with the "cessation of major hostilities" between established military forces. Alternatively, if the term includes the subsequent military [[occupation of Iraq]], the "War" ended with the ceremonial handover of [[sovereignty]] to the [[Politics of Iraq|new Iraqi government]] in June 2004. Though Coalition military officials have used the capitalized phrase ''Iraq War'' in this relatively narrow sense, they, and those politically in support of the invasion and current military presence (or 'occupation') also consistently use the terms ''Iraq war'' and '''war in Iraq''.  A derivative of this viewpoint sees much of the current violence almost exclusively as expressions of the [[sectarian violence in Iraq|Iraqi sectarian divisions]], and characterize the occupation as democratic, and preventative of a larger [[civil war]].<br/>-<br/>-==War rationales and debates==<br/>-The more exclusive definitions of the "Iraq War" term (ie. the operations delimited to major hostilities against the Saddam Hussein government of Iraq and limited to the 2003 invasion and the succeeding period of military occupation) rest on rationalisations which tend to disagree, in various opinions, with direct or meaningful comparisons with other conflicts, though these are largely found in stated (or perceived) goals by the Coalition for the invasion and occupation.  A better metric to determine precisely who the war is being waged upon should compare the number of civilian Iraqi deaths with the number of Iraqi soldiers killed in the first year of the war.  Because the United States has made no effort to estimate civilian casualities, the estimates vary considerably.<br/>- <br/>-In contrast, individuals who believe that the "Iraq war" is a continuing conflict base their concept of "war" and "occupation" on more general concepts, as opposed to the definitions of the United Nations, [[International law]], [[military law]]s, or political [[rhetoric|techniques for using language effectively]]. Being dominantly driven by the United States various critics' eyes, the conflict is characterized by a large and dominant U.S. military presence in a foreign country. To many critics, the Iraq War has numerous parallels with past wars (in particular the [[Vietnam War]]). Opponents of the war often hold that the current insurgency conflicts are a direct consequence of the U.S.-led invasion and occupation. They hold to concepts defined largely by lessons learned from American involvement in Southeast Asia.<br/>-<br/>-Both critics and supporters of the war have disagreed about the validity of the rationales, and over whether the ''[[ex post facto]]'' failure to find weapons "''stockpiles''" indicates the destruction or transportation of such weapons prior to the war or failure of intelligence (or, by some, deliberate deceit).  The failure of western intelligence to distinguish between these two possibilities is perceived by some as a failure of intelligence.  As stated in public speakings such goals have changed notably since 2002, and views differ as to whether past statements should be considered "failed goals" (or "deceptive premises") for the war. <br/>-<br/>-: ''Related topic: [[Iraq War- Rationale|Rationales of the 2003 Invasion of Iraq]]''<br/>-<br/>-===War justifications===<br/>-[[Pretext]]s of the invasion and occupation as stated by the United States in 2002 before the Iraq invasion are likewise controversial factors.  Over time, these have varied.  The first calls for war on Iraq came from the [[Project for the New American Century]] (PNAC), and the [[American Enterprise Institute]], with arguments based largely on the disruption of the emerging modernizing Islamic Middle East, and the project of American influence into the next century.  These reasons were not those originally given (before the 2003 Iraq invasion) by the Bush administration of the United States before or after the initiation of the war, which instead included:<br/>-# The Hussein's regime was in violation of [[United Nations]] demands for weapons inspections. The reason was however obviated by the Bush administration itself, who set a deadline while inspectors were active in Iraq.<br/>-# Hussein's regime produced and possessed stockpiles of [[weapons of mass destruction]] and posed a threat to the U.S.<br/>-# Iraqi government had failed to comply with 19 UN resolutions requiring a full accounting of its weapons of mass destruction and full cooperation with UN inspections.{{ref|Powell}}{{ref|USAToday}}. <br/>-# That the Hussein's regime had ties to [[al Qaeda]] and other terrorist organizations that posed a threat to international safety;{{ref|whitehouse}}; and,<br/>-# promoting democratic self-government in the nearly-entirely autocratic Arab Middle East.  <br/>-<br/>-Leaders of the multinational coalition have also pointed to [[human rights]] issues to justify the war. Saddam's regime's abuse of Iraqi citizens' human rights and the spread of democracy was cited, as articulated in US President [[George W. Bush]] 2003 [[State of the Union]] Address: <br/>-<br/>-: "''The dictator who is assembling the world's most dangerous weapons has already used them on whole villages &mdash; leaving thousands of his own citizens dead, blind, or disfigured. Iraqi refugees tell us how forced confessions are obtained &mdash; by torturing children while their parents are made to watch. International human rights groups have catalogued other methods used in the torture chambers of Iraq: electric shock, burning with hot irons, dripping acid on the skin, mutilation with electric drills, cutting out tongues, and rape. If this is not [[evil]], then evil has no meaning. And tonight I have a message for the brave and oppressed people of Iraq: Your enemy is not surrounding your country &mdash; your enemy is ruling your country. And the day he and his regime are removed from power will be the day of your liberation.''"

Some also posit that since the United States military has not lost a single battle, the multinational forces have removed a dictatorship, and the foundation for a new democracy in the Middle East has been set down.

The war's unpopularity was reflected in widespread protests, including allegedly the largest worldwide protest in human history on February 15th, 2003 (eg., a day of [[Protests against the 2003 Iraq war|Global protests against war in Iraq]]). The Iraq War was widely viewed by many critics as counterproductive. Many viewed the war as improper (being a moral and ethical violation) and [[illegal]] under [[international law]]. By the summer of 2005, there was an increase in the number of individuals in the [[United States]] who felt the same way. <br/>-<br/>-Since the October 2005 indictment of [[Lewis Libby]], politicians (including some of those who saw the same intelligence that was classified and used by the executive branch in America) and some citizens have begun to question pre-war intelligence and how it may have been misused in order to "sell", in their opinion, a war to the American people.[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10043606/] On the Senate floor during speeches, it was stated that, <br/>-: "''President Bush exaggerated the threat to the American people. It was not subtle. It was not nuanced. It was pure, unadulterated fear-mongering''!" Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] (D-Mass.) [November 10, 2005]<br/>-<br/>-====Antiwar rationales====<br/>-The opponents to the wars' main rationales are, in their opinion, the ''"fixed intelligence"'' and "''lack of connection to 9/11''". Antiwar activists and opponents of the war draw direct parallels to the earlier actions (especially the [[Vietnam War]]) via several debated elements of evidence. This includes:<br/>-<br/>-* its protracted nature, being defined by the continued dominant presence of coalition soldiers (in particular, United States units),<br/>-* the previous changing status of the local government,<br/>-* the sectarian factionalism,<br/>-* changes and conflicts in the publicly stated goals of the war and later occupation,<br/>-* the colonialist character of the occupation (i.e. "colonize the government", blanket and unconditional [[diplomatic immunity]] for soldiers, etc.),<br/>-* evidence of local activity of paramilitary and militant groups (commonly known as the "insurgency" and, at other times, the "resistance"), political dissidence, and non-violent protests,<br/>-* lack of evidence of weapons of mass destruction,<br/>-* evidence of war crimes (eg., [[Abu Ghraib prison abuse|Abu Ghraib]], indiscriminate bombing, extra-judicial killings, intentional targeting of civilians, etc.), and <br/>-* evidence of fraud, incompetence, and inefficiency of the "reconstruction" (eg., [[Halliburton]], reused [[MRE]]s, etc.), <br/>-<br/>-among other evidence that they believe connects this war to previous military actions.<br/>-<br/>-Critics have cited that, economically, the various engagements in Iraq has cost the United States about [[USD]] $200,[[billion|000,000,000]], and still costs about [[USD]] $6,[[billion|000,000,000]] a month. <br/>-[http://nationalpriorities.org/index.php?option=com_wrapper&Itemid=182] , with exceptionally poor accounting of how the funds are being spent.  Concern is growing that corporations with ties to the Bush administration, notably Halliburton, which was provided no-bid contracts that many considered illegal due to their size, to be the primary beneficiaries of the execution of the war.<br/>-<br/>-{{further|[[Criticism of the Iraq War]], [[Popular opposition to the 2003 Iraq War]], [[American popular opinion of invasion of Iraq]], [[Protests against the 2003 Iraq war]], and [[Popular opposition to war on Iraq]]}}<br/>-<br/>-====Countries against====  <br/>-<br/>-The following countries' governments did not support the War of Iraq:<br/>-{{col-begin}}<br/>-{{col-3}}<br/>-* The majority of the 114 governments of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]<br/>-* [[Russia]]<br/>-* [[China]]<br/>-<br/>-{{col-3}}<br/>-* [[Pakistan]]<br/>-* [[Morocco]]<br/>-* [[Germany]]<br/>-* [[Sweden]]<br/>-<br/>-{{col-4}}<br/>-* [[France]]<br/>-* [[Canada]]<br/>-* [[New Zealand]]<br/>-* [[Belgium]]<br/>-{{col-end}}<br/>-* [[Switzerland]]<br/>-* [[Luxembourg]]<br/>-* [[The Vatican]]<br/>-* [[Brazil]]<br/>-* [[Mexico]]<br/>-* [[Chile]]<br/>-<br/>-===Iraq Survey Group findings===<br/>-In October 2003, the [[Iraq Survey Group]] released the [[Kay Report|report of interim ISG findings]] which indicated that small amounts of weapons of mass destruction were uncovered, (including a number of vials containing biological agents stored in the home refrigerators of Iraqi scientists, for example) as well as discoveries of non-WMD programs banned by the United Nations and concealed during the IAEA and UNMOVIC inspections that began in 2002. Kay testified on January 28, 2004 that "''the effort that has been directed to this point has been sufficiently intense that it is highly unlikely that there were large stockpiles of deployed, militarized chemical weapons ''[in Iraq]".  The Iraq Survey Group later released the [[Duelfer Report|final ISG report]] which included the following points:<br/>-<br/>-# Iraq had destroyed its stockpiles of biological and chemical weapons after the Gulf War [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,134625,00.html](but discoveries made by the ISG include a "''clandestine network of laboratories ... that contained equipment ... suitable for continuing chemical biological weapons research''"); <br/>-# Saddam Hussein convinced his top military commanders that Iraq did indeed possess WMD that could be used against any U.S. invasion force, in order to prevent a coup over the prospects of fighting the U.S.-led Coalition without these weapons; <br/>-# Iraq's main goal was to end sanctions while preserving the capability to reconstitute WMD production;<br/>-# Iraq had intended to restart all banned weapons programs as soon as multilateral sanctions against it had been dropped, a prospect that the Iraqi government saw coming soon;  <br/>-# Iraq used procurement contracts allowed under the Oil for Food program to buy influence among U.N. Security Council member states; <br/>-# No senior Iraqi official interviewed by the ISG believed that Saddam had forsaken WMD forever; <br/>-# There was "''no indication ''[Iraq had]'' resumed fissile material or nuclear weapon research and development activities since 1991''" (though there was extensive amount of "''documents and equipment, hidden in scientists' homes, that would have been useful in resuming uranium enrichment by centrifuge and electromagnetic isotope separation''"[http://www.cia.gov/cia/public_affairs/speeches/2003/david_kay_10022003.html] and a "''number of post-1995 activities that would have aided the reconstitution of the nuclear weapons program once sanctions were lifted''". [http://www.cia.gov/cia/reports/iraq_wmd_2004/chap4.html]). <br/>-<br/>-[[David Kay]] opened his testimony during the "''[[Kay Report]]''" at a Senate panel by stating "''We were almost all wrong''" on Iraq (a quote commonly missattributed to the later head of the ISG, [[Charles A. Duelfer|Charles Duelfer]],[http://www.mrc.org/cyberalerts/2004/cyb20041011.asp#2] [http://watch.windsofchange.net/themes_94.htm#wrong]). Kay went on though to say that, "Iraq was in clear violation of the terms of Resolution 1441". He stated, "the work of the Iraq Survey Group has shown that Saddam Hussein had WMD intentions, had WMD programs that did survive, and did outwit for 12 years the United Nations Security Council and the resolutions  [...] in large measure." Kay did "believe that the effort that has been directed to this point has been sufficiently intense that it is highly unlikely that there were large stockpiles of deployed militarized chemical and biological weapons there". He also stated, in spite of missing stockpiles, that "the world is far safer with [...] the removal of Saddam Hussein."<br/>-[http://www.ceip.org/<br/>-<br/>-Sa<br/>-{{see also|Iraq disarmament crisis|Iraq and weapons of mass destruction}}<br/>-<br/>-==War of Iraq==<br/>-{| border="1" width="325" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="right" style="margin: 1em 0 1em 1em; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;"<br/>-!colspan="2" bgcolor="#ffff99"| '''War of Iraq'''<br/>-|-<br/>-|Conflict||War of Iraq<br/>-|-<br/>-|Date||[[March 20]], [[2003]]–[[May 1]], [[2003]] [major combat] (Occupation end: [[June 28]], [[2004]])<br/>-|-<br/>-|Place||[[Iraq]]<br/>-|-<br/>-|Result||<br/>-* Removal from power and dissolution of the [[Ba'ath Party]], <br/>-* The government of [[Saddam Hussein]] ended, <br/>-* [[Post-invasion Iraq, 2003–2005|Multinational force's occupation of Iraq]],<br/>-* The switching of the sale of petroleum from euros back to dollars,  <br/>-* The rise of the [[Iraqi insurgency]] and widespread acts of terror throughout Iraq,<br/>-* Election of a [[republic|representative government]], and<br/>-* Full participation of minority [[Kurd]]s and majority [[Shi'ite]]s in governmental power<br/>-|-<br/>-!colspan="2" bgcolor="#ffff99"|Major combatants<br/>-|-<br/>-| width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center"|[[Iraq|Republic of Iraq]]<BR>[[Image:Iraq flag 300.png|75px|Flag of Iraq]]<br>([[Saddam Hussein]] regime)<br><BR>[[Ba'ath Party|Ba'ath Loyalists]]<br><br><br/>-| width="50%" valign="top" style="text-align:center"|[[Multinational force in Iraq|Multinational force]] (aka., "''[[Coalition of the Willing]]''")<br><br/>-[[United States|United States of America]]<br>[[Image:Us flag large.png|75px|Flag of the United States]]<br><br>[[United Kingdom]]<br>[[Image:Flag of the United Kingdom.svg|76px|Flag of the UK]]<br><br>[[Australia]]<br>[[Image:Flag_of_Australia.svg|76px|Australian National Flag]]<br><br/>-|-<br/>-!colspan="2" |'''Victor''':  Multinational forces<br/>-|-<br/>-!colspan="2" |Categories<br/>-|-<br/>-!colspan="2"| [[Military history of Iraq]]<br>[[Military history of the United Kingdom]]<br>[[Military history of the United States]]<br/>-|}<br/>-<br/>-The '''War of Iraq''' (2003) was the [[war]] in the [[Middle East]] country of [[Iraq]], which resulted from the the [[Iraq disarmament crisis]] of late 2002 and began with the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of 2003]]. The war was between the Iraqi military and a [[coalition]] of [[Multinational force in Iraq|multinational forces]]. The United States and the United Kingdom were the two major components of the US-dubbed "[[Coalition of the willing]]" that invaded Iraq and deposed Saddam Hussein's regime. The US and UK claimed that the invasion was justified because Saddam Hussein had not complied with 19 UN resolutions requiring Iraq to destroy its special weapons and programs after the previous war.{{ref|Powell00}}{{ref|powellformer}}. The forces opposing the coalition units were the [[conscription|conscript]] [[Iraqi Regular Army]] reinforced and strengthened by the [[Iraqi Republican Guard|Republican Guard]] and [[Fedayeen Saddam]]. The Iraqi forces presented little resistance to the invasion. In [[Post-invasion Iraq, 2003–2005|post-invasion Iraq (2003–2005)]], after the Hussein regime had been overthrown, activity centered around coalition and U.N. efforts to establishing a sovereign state. According to some opinion polls, the war was unpopular from the outset in many Coalition countries. <br/>- <br/>-The "War of Iraq" refers to the war proper, beginning with the 2003 invasion, continuing in the occupation, and ending at the handover of sovereignty to the [[Politics of Iraq|new Iraqi government]]. This conflict resulted in the defeat of the Iraqi regular Army and its supportive divisions. (''ed''., the details of this are cover in this article) <br/>-<br/>-===Operation Iraqi Freedom===<br/>-''Operation Iraqi Freedom'' &mdash; often rumored to have been originally called ''Operation Iraqi Liberation'' before being changed due to an unwanted acronym &mdash; had the following military objectives, according to [[U.S. Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]]:<br/>-<br/>-# to end the regime of Saddam Hussein. <br/>-# to identify, isolate and eliminate Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. <br/>-# to search for, to capture and to drive out terrorists from that country. <br/>-# to collect such intelligence as we can related to terrorist networks. <br/>-# to collect such intelligence as we can related to the global network of illicit weapons of mass destruction <br/>-# to end sanctions and to immediately deliver humanitarian support to the displaced and to many needy Iraqi citizens. <br/>-# to secure Iraq's oil fields and resources, which belong to the Iraqi people. <br/>-# to help the Iraqi people create conditions for a transition to a representative self-government.<br/>-<br/>-====Prior to invasion==== <br/>-[[Image:Iraq NO FLY ZONES.PNG|thumb|left|200px|''No-fly zone detail'']]<br/>-<br/>-Prior to invasion, the United States and other coalition forces involved in the 1991 [[Persian Gulf War]] had been engaged in a low-level conflict with Iraq, enforcing [[Iraqi no-fly zones]]. Iraqi air-defense installations were engaged on a fairly regular basis after repeatedly targeting American and British air patrols. In mid-2002, the U.S. began to change its response strategy, more carefully selecting targets in the southern part of the country in order to disrupt the military command structure in Iraq.  A change in enforcement tactics was acknowledged at the time, but it was not made public that this was part of a plan known as [[Operation Southern Watch]].<br/>-<br/>-The weight of bombs dropped increased from none in March 2002 and 0.3 in April 2002 to between 8 and 14 tons per month in May-August, reaching a pre-war peak of 54.6 tons in September - prior to Congress' [[11 October]] [[Joint Resolution to Authorize the Use of United States Armed Forces Against Iraq|authorisation of the invasion]]. The September attacks included a [[5 September]] 100-aircraft attack on the main air defence site in western Iraq. According to ''[[The New Statesman]]'' this was "Located at the furthest extreme of the southern no-fly zone, far away from the areas that needed to be patrolled to prevent attacks on the Shias, it was destroyed not because it was a threat to the patrols, but to allow allied special forces operating from Jordan to enter Iraq undetected." {{ref|newstatesman}}<br/>-<br/>-{{further|[[Governments' pre-war positions on invasion of Iraq]], [[Public relations preparations for 2003 invasion of Iraq]], [[The UN Security Council and the Iraq war]], and  [[American government position on invasion of Iraq]]}}<br/>-<br/>-====Combat and occupation summary====<br/>-{{main|2003 invasion of Iraq}}<br/>-<br/>-[[Multinational force in Iraq|Coalition forces]] managed to topple the government and capture the key cities of a large nation in 21 days, taking minimal losses while attempting ineffectively to avoid large civilian deaths and high numbers of dead Iraqi military forces. Utilizing massive precision [[air strike]]s along with rapid ground attacks, the invasion seemed a success of the U.S., and did not require the huge army build-up like the 1991 [[Gulf War]], which numbered half a million allied troops. This did prove short-sighted, however, due to the requirement for a much larger force to combat the irregular Iraqi forces in the aftermath of the war.<br/>-<br/>-The Iraqi army, armed mainly with [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] equipment, had no weapons that could stand up to invading forces, and managed only to stage a few ambushes that gained a great deal of media attention but in reality did nothing to slow the Coalition advance. Missiles launched from Iraq were either inderdicted by U.S. anti-air batteries, or missed their targets. Attacks on Coalition supply routes by [[Fedayeen]] militiamen were repulsed. The Iraqi's artillery proved almost worthless, and Iraq did not mobilize its air force to attempt a defense. The Iraqi [[T-72]] tanks, the heaviest [[armored vehicle]]s in the [[Iraqi Army]], were both outdated and ill-maintained and were destroyed quickly, in part due to the Coalition's [[air superiority|control of the air]]. The [[U.S. Air Force]], [[U.S. Army]], [[Marine Corps]] and [[United States Navy|Naval Aviation]], and [[British Royal Air Force]] operated with impunity throughout the country, pinpointing heavily defended enemy targets and destroying them before ground troops arrived.<br/>-<br/>-The [[main battle tank]]s (MBT) of the Coalition forces, the U.S. M1 Abrams and British Challenger 2, proved their worth in the rapid advance across the country. Even with the large number of RPG attacks by irregular Iraqi forces, few Coalition tanks were lost and no tank crewmen was killed by hostile fire. All three British tank crew fatalities were a result of friendly fire. The only tank loss sustained by the British Army was a Challenger 2 of the Queen's Royal Lancers that was hit by another Challenger 2, killing two crewmen.<br/>-<br/>-The Iraqi Army suffered from poor morale, even amongst the supposedly elite Republican Guard, their strength sapped after weeks of aerial bombardment. Entire units simply melted away into the crowds upon the approach of Coalition troops. Other Iraqi Army officers were bribed by the CIA or coerced into surrendering to coalition forces. Worse, the Iraqi Army had incompetent leadership - reports state that Qusay Hussein, charged with the defense of Baghdad, dramatically shifted the positions of the two main divisions protecting Baghdad several times in the days before the arrival of U.S. forces, and as a result the units within were both confused and further demoralized when the U.S. Army attacked. By no means did the Coalition invasion force see the entire Iraqi military thrown against it, and it is assumed that most units disintegrated to either join the growing Iraqi insurgency or return to their homes. The documented number of [[Casualties_of_the_conflict_in_Iraq_since_2003|Iraqi civilians killed by the Coalition military forces]] since 2003 according to various estimates ranges from 27,295 up to 30,789 (as of December 2005).<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-=====Bush's 'Mission Accomplished'=====<br/>-{{main|Mission Accomplished}}   <br/>-On [[1 May]] [[2003]] George W. Bush landed on the aircraft carrier [[USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72)|USS ''Abraham Lincoln'']], in a [[Lockheed]] [[S-3 Viking]], where he gave a speech announcing the end of major combat operations in the Iraq war. Bush's landing was criticized by opponents as an overly theatrical and expensive stunt. Clearly visible in the background was a banner stating "Mission Accomplished." It was criticized by some as premature - especially later as the [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]] dragged on. However, one crewmember later stated the banner referred specifically to the aircraft carrier's mission and not the war itself. In the weeks that followed Bush's dramatic aircraft carrier landing, all types of crime significantly increased in Iraq due to the lack of law enforcement and security after the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime.<br/>-<br/>-=====Rise of the insurgency=====<br/>-[[Image:Sunni triangle.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Map of the ''Sunni Triangle'']]<br/>-In May of 2003, after the Iraqi conventional forces had been defeated, the coalition military noticed a gradually increasing flurry of attacks on the multinational troops in various regions, such as the "[[Sunni Triangle]]." In the chaos after the war, massive looting of the infrastructure, and most catastrophically, munitions occurred. According to the Pentagon, 250,000 tons (of 650,000 tons total) of ordnance were looted, providing an endless source of ammunition for the insurgents. <br/>-<br/>-The [[Iraqi insurgency|insurgency in Iraq]] was concentrated in, but not limited to, an area referred to by Western media and the occupying forces as the ''Sunni triangle''. This location includes Baghdad [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/iraqi_freedom-ops-maps.htm]. Critics point out that the regions where violence was most common was also the most populated regions, but this was not entirely true. The three provinces that had the most number of attacks were Baghdad, Anbar, and Salah Ad Din. Combined they account for 32% of the population. This may be misleading because Baghdad has a low ratio of attacks per capita. This resistance has been described as a type of [[guerrilla warfare]]. Insurgent tactics include mortars, suicide bombers, roadside bombs, small arms fire, and RPGs, as well as sabotage against the oil, water, and electrical infrastructure.<br/>-<br/>-There is evidence that some of the resistance was organized, perhaps by the [[fedayeen]] and other Saddam Hussein or Ba'ath loyalists, religious radicals, Iraqis angered by the occupation, and foreign terrorists. [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/135125876_guerrilla30.html] The insurgents are generally known to the Coalition forces as Anti-Iraqi Forces or AIF. <br/>-<br/>-*[[Operation Planet X]] (15 May 2003)<br/>-<br/>-=====Post-invasion Iraq, early- and mid-2003=====<br/>-{{main|Post-invasion Iraq, 2003–2005}}<br/>-<br/>-The ''[[post-invasion Iraq, 2003–2005|post-invasion environment]]'' began after the Hussein regime had been overthrown.

A series of similar operations were launched throughout the summer in the Sunni Triangle. Toward the end of 2003, the intensity and pace of insurgent attacks began to increase. A sharp surge in guerilla attacks, ushered in an insurgent effort that was termed the “[[Ramadan Offensive]],” as it coincided with the beginning of the Muslim holy month of [[Ramadan]]. Coaliton forces brought to bear the use of air power for the first time since the end of the war. <br/>-<br/>-Suspected ambush sites and mortar launching positions struck from the air and with artillery fire. Surveillance of major routes, patrols, and raids on suspected insurgents were stepped up. In addition, two villages, including Saddam’s birthplace of al-Auja and the small town of Abu Hishma were wrapped in barbed wire and carefully monitored. On [[22 July]] [[2003]], during a raid by the [[United States|U.S.]] [[101st Airborne Division]] and men from [[Task Force 20]], Saddam Hussein's sons ([[Uday Hussein|Uday]] and [[Qusay Hussein|Qusay]]) and one of his grandsons were killed. <br/>-<br/>-{{col-begin}}<br/>-{{col-break}}<br/>-*[[Operation Peninsula Strike]] (09 June 2003 - 12 June 2003) <br/>-*[[Operation Desert Scorpion]] (15 June 2003 - 29 June 2003) <br/>-*[[Operation Scorpion Sting]] <br/>-*[[Operation Spartan Scorpion]] <br/>-*[[Operation Rifles Scorpion]] <br/>-*[[Operation Sidewinder]] (29 June 2003 - 07 July 2003) <br/>-*[[Operation Soda Mountain]] (12 July 2003 - 17 July 2003) <br/>-*[[Operation Ivy Serpent]] (12 July 2003 - 21 July 2003) <br/>-*[[Operation Iron Bullet]] (July 2003) <br/>-*[[Operation Tyr]] (July 2004) <br/>-*[[Operation Ivy Lightning]] (12 August 2003) <br/>-*[[Operation Silverado]] (16 August 2003) <br/>-*[[Operation Ivy Needle]] (26 August 2003 - ?) <br/>-*[[Operation Longstreet]] (September 2003) <br/>-*[[Operation Tiger Clean Sweep]] (07 September 2003) <br/>-<br/>-{{col-break}}<br/>-*[[Operation Industrial Sweep]] (October 2003) <br/>-*[[Operation Chamberlain]] (15 October 2003 - ?) <br/>-*[[Operation Sweeney]] (15 October 2003 - ?) <br/>-*[[Operation O.K.

With the weather growing cooler, United States forces were able to operate in full armor which reduced their casualty rate. The provisional government began training a security force intended to defend critical infrastructure, and the United States promised over $20 billion in reconstruction money in the form of credit against Iraq's future oil revenues. Of this, less than half a billion dollars had been spent in 10 months after it had been promised.  Oil revenues were also used for rebuilding schools and for work on the electrical and refining infrastructure.<br/>-<br/>-Shortly after the capture of Saddam, elements left out of the [[CPA]] began to agitate for elections and the formation of a [[Iraqi Interim Government]]. Most prominent among these was the Shia cleric [[Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani|Ali al-Sistani]]. More insurgents stepped up their activities. The two most turbulent centers were the area around Fallujah and the poor Shia sections of cities from Baghdad to Basra in the south.<br/>-<br/>-{{col-begin}}<br/>-{{col-break}}<br/>-*[[Operation Panther Backroads]] (15 December 2003) <br/>-*[[Operation Ivy Blizzard]] (17 December 2003 - ?) <br/>-*[[Operation Arrowhead Blizzard]] (17 December 2003 - ?) <br/>-*[[Operation Iron Justice]] (18 December 2003 - ?) <br/>-*[[Operation Rifles Fury]] (21 December 2003 - ?)<br/>-<br/>-{{col-break}}<br/>-*[[Operation Salm]] (23 December 2003) <br/>-*[[Operation Devil Siphon]] (23 December 2003 - ?) <br/>-*[[Operation Iron Grip]] (24 December 2003 - ?) <br/>-*[[Operation Iron Force]] (24 December 2003 - ?) <br/>-*[[Operation Choke Hold]] (30 December 2003)<br/>-{{col-end}}<br/>-<br/>-=====Military occupation, early-2004=====<br/>-Early 2004 was marked by a relative lull in violence.

The anti-occupation forces are believed to be predominantly, but not exclusively, Iraqi Sunni Muslim Arabs, plus some foreign Arab and Muslim fighters, some of the latter tied to al-Qaeda. Several minor coalition members have pulled out of Iraq; this has been widely considered a political success for the anti-occupation forces.<br/>-<br/>-The failure to restore basic services to above pre-war levels, where over a decade of sanctions, bombing, corruption, and decaying infrastructure had left major cities functioning at much-reduced levels, also contributed to local anger at the IPA government headed by an executive council. On [[2 July]] [[2003]], President Bush declared that American troops would remain in Iraq in spite of the attacks, challenging the opponents with "My answer is, [[Bring 'em on]]," a line the President later expressed misgivings about having used. {{ref|newsmax}} In the summer of 2003, the multinational forces focused on hunting down the remaining leaders of the former regime, culminating in the shooting deaths of Saddam's two sons in July. In all, over 200 top leaders of the former regime were killed or captured, as well as numerous lesser functionaries and military personnel. <br/>-<br/>-{{seealso|Occupation of Iraq timeline}}<br/>-<br/>-=====Increased terrorism and the Mahdi Army=====<br/>-Terroristic acts increased during the beginning of 2004. Hundreds of Iraqi civilians and police were killed over this period in a series of massive bombings. The bombings indicated that as the relevance of Saddam Hussein and his followers was diminishing, radical Islamists, both foreign and Iraqi. An organized Sunni insurgency, with deep roots and both nationalist and Islamist motivations, was becoming clearer. The Mahdi Army also began launching attacks on coalition targets and to seize control from Iraqi security forces. The southern and central portions of Iraq were beginning to erupt in urban guerilla combat as multinational forces attempted to keep control and prepared for a counteroffensive. <br/>-<br/>-{{col-begin}}<br/>-{{col-break}}<br/>-*[[Operation Warhorse Whirlwind]] (January 2004) <br/>-*[[Operation Iron Resolve]] (January 2004) <br/>-*[[Operation Market Sweep]] (13 January 2004) <br/>-*[[Operation Saloon]] (14 January 2004) <br/>-*[[Operation Rock Slide]] (15 January 2004) <br/>-*[[Operation Final Cut]] (28 January 2004 - ?)<br/>-<br/>-{{col-break}}<br/>-*[[Operation Saber Turner II]] (February 2004) <br/>-*[[Operation Tomahawk]] (February 2004) <br/>-*[[Operation Trailblazer]] (February 2004) <br/>-*[[Operation Eagle Liberty]] 3 (19 February 2004) <br/>-*[[Operation Devil Clinch]] (21 February 2004) <br/>-*[[Operation Rocketman]] (26 February 2004)<br/>-{{col-end}}<br/>-<br/>-=====Fallujah and the Shiite south=====<br/>-The coalition and the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] decided to face the growing insurgency with a pair of assaults: one on [[Fallujah]], the center of the "Mohammed's Army of Al-Ansar", and another on [[Najaf]], home of an important mosque, which had become the focal point for the [[Mahdi Army]] and its activities. Just before the [[US occupation of Fallujah|attack on Fallujah]], four [[private military contractor]]s, working for [[Blackwater USA]], were [[ambush]]ed and their corpses [[Mutilation|mutilate]]d by a large crowd, receiving a great deal of media attention.<br/>-[[Image:Fallujahtracer.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Tracer ammunition|Tracer rounds]] from [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] in the direction of [[Sunni Muslim]] city of [[Fallujah]].]]<br/>-After four private military contractors were killed and mutilated, preperation took place for the US Marines to take over responsibility for al-Anbar province in which Fallujah is located. On April 4, the [[Operation Vigilant Resolve|multinational forces began assaults to clear Fallujah of insurgents]]. On April 9, the multinational force allowed more than 70,000 women, children and elderly residents to leave the besieged city, reportedly also allowing males of military age to leave. On April 10, the military declared a unilateral truce to allow for humanitarian supplies to enter Fallujah. Troops pulled back to the outskirts of the city; local leaders reciprocated the ceasefire, although lower-level intense fighting on both sides continued.<br/>-<br/>-The usage by the U.S. of [[white phosphorus (weapon)|white phosphorus]] as an incendiary weapon against insurgents in Fallujah attracted controversy. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4440664.stm]<br/>-<br/>-The city of Fallujah remained under insurgent control despite the Marine's attempt to recapture it in [[Operation Vigilant Resolve]]. In the April battle for Fallujah, Coalition troops killed about 600 insurgents and a number of civilians, while 40 Americans died and hundreds were wounded in a fierce battle. The coalition forces were unable to dislodge the insurgents, and instead suffered repeated attacks on its own rear and flank. The Marines were ordered to stand-down and cordon off the city, maintaining a perimeter around Fallujah. A compromise was reached in order to ensure security within Fallujah itself by creating the local "[[Fallujah Brigade]]". While the Marine Division attacking had clear superiority in ground firepower and air support, it decided to accept a truce and a deal which put a former Baathist general in complete charge of the town. This compromise soon fell apart and insurgent control returned. By the end of the spring uprising, the cities of Fallujah, Samarra, Baquba, and Ramadi had been left under guerilla control with coalition patrols in the cities at a minimum. <br/>-<br/>-Meanwhile, the fighting continued in the Shiite south. The marines were then shifted south, because Italian and Polish forces were having increasing difficulties retaining control over [[Nasiriya]] and [[Najaf]]. The marines relieved the Poles and Italians, and put down the overt rebellion, but were unable to reestablish control over the centers of the towns. British forces in Basra were faced with increasing insurgency and became more selective in the areas they patrolled. In all, April, May and early June saw more fighting. Over the next three months, the multinanational forces took back the southern cities. Due to various setbacks, the Coalition gradually began admitting that it was facing independent organized rebel forces. Also, various insurgent leaders entered into negotiations with the provisional government to lay down arms and enter the political process. <br/>-<br/>-{{col-begin}}<br/>-{{col-break}}<br/>-*[[Operation Iron Promise]] (March 2004) <br/>-*[[Operation Shillelagh]] (March 2004) <br/>-*[[Operation Devil Thrust]] (March 2004) <br/>-*[[Operation Aloha]] (March 2004) <br/>-*[[Operation Centaur Rodeo]] (March 2004) <br/>-*[[Operation Warrior]] (03 March 2004) <br/>-*[[Operation Suicide Kings]] (17 March 2004) <br/>-*[[Operation Tiger Fury]] (30 March 2004 - ?) <br/>-*[[Operation Iron Saber]] (April 2004 - June 2004) <br/>-*[[Operation Duke Fortitude]] (April 2004) <br/>-*[[Operation Lancer Fury]] (April 2004) <br/>-*[[Operation Lancer Lightning]] <br/>-*[[Operation Vigilant Resolve]] (05 April 2004) <br/>-*[[Operation Resolute Sword]] (08 April 2004)<br/>-<br/>-{{col-break}}<br/>-*[[Operation Danger Fortitude]] (11 April 2004 - 17 April 2004) <br/>-*[[Operation Ripper Sweep]] (12 April 2004 - ?) <br/>-*[[Operation Yellow Stone]] (23 April 2004) <br/>-*[[Operation Rapier Thrust]] (May 2004) <br/>-*[[Operation Spring Clean-up]] (May 2004) <br/>-*[[Operation Striker Hurricane]] (1 May 2004) <br/>-*[[Operation Wolfpack Crunch]] (4 May 2004) <br/>-*[[Operation Disarm]] (19 May 2004) <br/>-*[[Operation Giuliani]] (June 2004) <br/>-*[[Operation Slim Shady]] (June 2004) <br/>-*[[Operation Striker Tornado]] (June 2004) <br/>-*[[Operation Rocketman III]] (June 2004) <br/>-*[[Operation Dragon Victory]] (19 June 2004 - ?)<br/>-*[[Operation Gimlet Crusader]] (24 June 2004)<br/>-{{col-end}}<br/>-<br/>-==Operations under the new Iraqi government==<br/>-:''Main article: [[Iraqi_insurgency#Iraqi coalition counter-insurgency operations|Iraqi coalition counter-insurgency operations]]<br/>-<br/>-Toward the end of June (2004), the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] transferred the "[[sovereignty]]" of Iraq to a caretaker government, whose first act was to begin the trial of [[Saddam Hussein]]. Sovereign power handed to the interim government ended the occupation of Iraq. Fighting continued in the form of an [[insurgency|insurgent]] [[rebellion]] against the new sovereignty, with some parts composed of non-Iraqi [[Islam|Muslim]] [[militant]] groups like [[Osama bin Laden]]'s [[al Qaeda]]. The new government began the process of moving towards open elections, though the insurgency and the lack of cohesion within the government itself, has lead to delays. Militia leader [[Muqtada al-Sadr]] took control of Najaf and, after negotiations broke down, the government asked the United States for help dislodging him. Through the months of July and August, a series of skirmishes in and around Najaf culminated with the Imman Ali Mosque itself under siege, only to have a peace deal brokered by al-Sistani in late August. Al-Sadr then declared a national cease fire, and opened negotiations with the American and government forces on disbanding his militia and entering the political process.<br/>-<br/>-==The Iraqi insurgency==<br/>-{{main|Iraqi insurgency}}<br/>-<br/>-With the Ba'ath party organization disintegrated, elements of the secret police and Republican Guard formed guerrilla units, since some had simply gone home rather than openly fight the multinational forces.

In the fall, the [[insurgent|anti-occupation]] groups, [[guerrilla]] units, and other elements (who called themselves "''[[freedom fighters]]''") began using ambush tactics, bombings, kidnappings, and [[improvised explosive device]]s, targeting coalition forces, checkpoints, and civilian targets.

Perhaps it is you who is the grumpy one? And '''describing''' 'burglarize' as not a real word (which is correct in all my experiences) is not being prescriptivist at all, not that there's anything bad about either extreme. My point was that it is not a neutral term. Perhaps if burgle is unacceptable State‐side, a different word can be found?

I certainly didn't mean to call you "grumpy" in a negative way- this may be another dialect thing, but in my experience this word almost always has a humorous connotation.  As to Main Page content, I don't know if we're going for "neutrality" as much as widest understandability, and I would guess "burglarize" is probably more understandable to "burgle" users than vice versa.

This definition is translated directly from the Chinese term, [[wushu]] (&#27494;&#26415;; [[pinyin]]: ''w&#468; shù''; [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]]: ''mou seut''), literally, "martial art", meaning all manner of Chinese martial lols.<br/>-<br/>-This term is slightly anomalous in its English usage.  Its strict meaning should be "lols for military use" (flying [[fighter aircraft]], [[sniper]] training, and so forth) but in normal usage it is used to refer to formalized systems of training to fight without modern technology.  It is nevertheless valuable to distinguish between fighting systems intended for soldiers in battle (even without modern technology) and fighting systems intended for sport or for civilian self-defense or for getting some sweet sweet ====cock====.<br/>-<br/>-LOL SOMETHING AWFUL DOT COM<br/>-<br/>-It's for fags<br/>-<br/>-OMG SOMEONE BUY ME AN SA ACCOUNT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>-<br/>-... and now it's being fagged up with phrases like "SOMETHING AWFUL DOT COM" and "YAY HAPPYCAT". Tards.<br/>-<br/>-YOU IDIOTS STOP FAGGING UP THE ARTICLE<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-Fucking with the wikipedia is akin to fucking with the IMDb. Nerds everywhere stand up, with strangely resolute looks on their nerdy faces, and say "Now you've gone too far."<br/>-<br/>-And then they sit down and fix what you broke. I am one of these people.<br/>-<br/>-==Martial lols as sport==<br/>-<br/>-LOL SOMETHING AWFUL DOT COM<br/>-<br/>-== Headline text ==<br/>-<br/>-=SERIOUS BUISNESS GOD DAMM COCKS =<br/>-<br/>-On the subject of competition, martial artists vary wildly. Some lols, such as [[Boxing]], [[TaeKwonDo]], [[Muay Thai]], and [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]] train solely for full contact matches, whereas others like [[Aikido]] and [[Krav Maga]] actively spurn such competitions. Some schools believe that competition breeds better and more efficient practitioners, and gives a sense of good sportsmanship. Others believe that the rules under which competition takes place have removed the combat effectiveness of martial lols or encourage a kind of practice which focuses on winning trophies rather than the more traditional focus of combat effectiveness, or in East Asian cultures, of developing the Confucian person, which eschews showing off (see [[Confucius]], also [[renaissance man]].)<br/>-<br/>-As part of the response to sport martial lols, new forms of competition are being held such as the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] in the U.S. or [[Pancrase]] in Japan which are also known as mixed martial lols or [[MMA]] events.  While the financial success or failure of these events is not well-known, it is interesting to note that certain systems do indeed tend to dominate these full contact or freestyle competitions.  Supporters of those styles which win time and again make the statement that this proves the real-world self defense effectiveness of their art.<br/>-<br/>-Martial lols have also found their way into Western Sports not commonly associated with martial lols.  The most famous of these is the [[Fighting in ice hockey]], or "Hockey Fight," which is similar to boxing.  The process stlols when two hockey players take off their protective gloves and helmets, grab each other and throw punches with their dominant hand.  While these actions are not considered true martial lols, they are complex and unique fighting style that has been studied as an art form.<br/>-<br/>-==Martial lols and dance==<br/>-As has been mentioned above, in many cultures martial lols can be performed in dance-like settings, either for evoking fiercefulness (...provoking adrenalin) in preparation of battle, or showing off skill in a more stylised manner, or both.<br/>-<br/>-Examples of such '''war dances''' include the [[gymnopaidiai]] from ancient [[Sparta]], New-Zealand's [[Haka]], the ''[[Sabre Dance]]'' depicted in [[Aram Khachaturian|Khachaturian]]'s ballet ''[[Gayane]]'', the [[Maasai]] "jumping" dance, [[Brunei]]'s ''[[Aduk-Aduk]]'', [[Qatar]]'s ''[[Ayyalah]]'', [[Brazil]]'s ''[[Capoeira]]'', ... (not to forget the spoofing [[weasel war dance]]).<br/>-<br/>-Often there appears some tension between martial lols (considered [[macho]]) and dancing (considered more [[effeminate]]): e.g. [[Plato]]'s ''The Laws'' devotes some attention to this topic. The solution given to this by the Maasai can be considered amongst the most original: they perform their "jumping" martial dance in women's attire, because, as they say, women are prettier than men.<br/>-<br/>-[[Ballet]], as it originated at the court of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] also goes back to a sort of ambiguity between being the ''strongest'' and being the ''most refined'': worldly power was granted by the king to his noblemen, according to their ability to perform refined "ballet" dancing like a bunch of fags.<br/>-<br/>-==Martial lols and self-defense==<br/>-In order to justify their existence and to attract students, many (if not most) martial lols schools make claims about their usefulness in "goatse-defense". <br/>-Such claims are a matter of constant debate among beginning level students of the martial lols. <br/>-<br/>-Self-defense situations happen with extreme rarity in most modern societies where such martial lols classes exist, and what situations do develop can generally be avoided by other means (e.g., not walking around drunk in bad neighbourhoods, not buying or selling [[illegal drug]]s, not getting involved with [[biker gang]]s, and so on).  Therefore understanding what is needed for self-defense requires understanding the situations that are likely to arise.<br/>-<br/>-There has been an ever-increasing perception among the general population, fuelled by the mass-media, that they are in constant danger of violence on the streets.  It is this fear that self-defense classes are intended to counter.  Since the fear is largely unfounded, self-defense classes need only reduce the feeling of fear in order to be effective. In practice, for the people to whom these martial lols classes are being marketed, the most likely situation in which they will experience a physical confrontation is [[domestic violence]].  <br/>-<br/>-Finally, the largest problem confronted by most people who are attacked is not a lack of physical ability to resist but an emotional reaction: a paralyzing panic or an undisciplined, blinding rage can turn a bad situation into a disastrous one.  <br/>-<br/>-All this said, years of serious training in martial lols are expected to take the emotional charge out of physically violent confrontations (after hundreds of hours of sparring, a punch or a kick becomes just a fist or a foot, a purely physical force, reduced by experience to something easily dealt with and not a "personal" attack as such) and gives practitioners good general coordination and confidence, both of which can discourage aggressors before aggression begins.  So, the experience of physical interaction over an extended period of time in martial lols training may be more relevant to its overall effectiveness at practical self-defense than any individual technique the art in question may include.<br/>-<br/>-The self-defense aspect has also changed the techniques used. In our modern world, we may be attacked by an unarmed person, someone with some sort of clubbing weapon (a baseball bat) or armed with a knife. The chance of being attacked by a fully armored, sword-wielding samurai is practically zero. Most martial lols included battlefield combat techniques in the past, but the emphasis on such techniques has declined in most styles.<br/>-<br/>-==Styles of Martial lols==<br/>-<br/>-* [[Karate]] simply means 'Open/Empty hand', and is perhaps the most popular Martial Art in the contempory West. It is Japanese and has several sub styles including [[Shotokan]], [[Shotokai]] and [[Wada Ryu]]. It is [[Japanese]] in origin.<br/>-* [[Taekwondo]]. A Korean art, similar to Karate except that kicking is given more focus. Along with Judo, one of only two lols to make it into the [[Olympic Games]].<br/>-* [[Kendo]] is the Japanese art of sword fighting, using bamboo swords (Shinai) and protective clothing. <br/>-* [[Kung Fu]] is a very diverse martial art that simply means 'good practice' - 'kung fu' can be used to describe one's cooking. Styles of Kung Fu include, [[She Quan]], [[Wing Chun]], [[Drunken boxing]], (Quan means boxing), and many more. This is an example of a [[Chinese]] style - these are more flamboyant than the direct attacks of the [[Japanese]] styles.<br/>-* [[Judo]] Means way of peace, ('Do' means 'Way of'), and consists of all of the throws from Jiu Jitsu without any of the striking moves. <br/>-* [[Jiu Jitsu]] A very comprehensive Martial Art with strikes, throws, grappling and locks.<br/>-* [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]] Also known as Gracie Jiu-Jitsu. A much modified version of the Japanese art which focuses on ground fighting, the theory being most fights end up on the ground anyway and most people are untrained to deal with that aspect of a fight. Arguably the most practical martial art for defence. <br/>-* [[Ninjitsu]] Originally practiced by [[Ninja]]s, this Martial Art combines traditional attacks with [[scout]] style survival and elusive moves.<br/>-* The different styles of [[T'ai Chi Ch'uan]] are a slow moving Chinese Martial Art practiced by many people for health maintenance. It is often described as "moving [[meditation]]." Despite the emphasis on relaxed training it actually means "Supreme Ultimate Fist" and often uses its [[nei chia|soft style]] interceptions to simultaneously counter attacks and strike the attacker. Often T'ai Chi classes include two person [[pushing hands]] as well as [[qigong|ch'i kung]], for greater health benefits and generating coordinated martial power.<br/>-* [[Jeet Kune Do]] Jeet Kune Do was developed by [[Bruce Lee]], one of the most influential figures in Martial lols in the 20th century. It means 'Way of the intercepting fist'.<br/>-* [[Capoeira]] is a Brazilian Martial Art very much like [[Break Dancing]] and involves a lot of flashy [[gymnastic]] moves. The fighting is very low to the ground and consists of mainly kicks, (armarda, hubjaheia). It was developed when Martial lols were banned, forcing the Brazilian slaves to disguise their training as dancing.<br/>-<br/>-==Further resources==<br/>-* For a detailed list of martial lols, see [[List of martial lols]]<br/>-* For a detailed list of martial lols weapons, see [[List of martial lols weapons]]<br/>-* For a detailed list of fictional martial lols, see [[List of fictional martial lols]]<br/>-* For everything else, see [[List of martial lols-related topics]]<br/>-<br/>-==See also==<br/>-* [[budo]]<br/>-* [[Bullshido]]<br/>-* [[Chan Buddhism]]<br/>-* [[koryu]]<br/>-* [[Martial lols film]]<br/>-* [[Martialism]]<br/>-* [[McDojo]]<br/>-* [[military technology and equipment]]<br/>-* [[mixed martial lols]] (MMA)<br/>-* [[Neo-Confucianism]]<br/>-* [[Qigong]]<br/>-* [[Taoism]]<br/>-* [[Wudangshan]]<br/>-<br/>-===External links===<br/>-* [http://www.faqs.org/faqs/martial-lols/faq/ rec.martial-lols FAQ]<br/>-* [http://martiallols.zymq.com Martial lols info, links and supply]<br/>-* [http://www.newmag.org/ NewMAG - Martial lols News, Forums, Classifieds, Blogs and Links.]<br/>-* [http://www.wrestlingpod.com Wrestling Gear & News from WrestlingPod]<br/>-* [http://www.martiallolsplanet.com Martial lols Planet, Articles and Forums]<br/>-* [http://www.fighttimes.com Fight Times] Free Online Martial lols Magazine<br/>-* [http://www.bctaekwondo.org BC Taekwondo Association]<br/>-<br/>-[[Category:Martial lols]] [[Category:Individual sports]] [[Category:Combat sports]]<br/>-[[bg:&#1041;&#1086;&#1081;&#1085;&#1086; &#1080;&#1079;&#1082;&#1091;&#1089;&#1090;&#1074;&#1086;]] [[ca:Art marcial]] [[cs:Bojov%C3%A9_um%C4%9Bn%C3%AD]] [[da:Kampkunst]] [[de:Kampfkunst]] [[es:Arte Marcial]] [[eo:luktosporto]] [[fr:Art martial]] [[ia:Arte martial]] [[it:Arti marziali]] [[ja:&#26684;&#38360;&#25216;]] [[nl:Vechtsport]] [[pl:Sztuki walki]] [[pt:Arte marcial]] [[ro:Arte mar&#355;iale]] [[ru:&#1045;&#1076;&#1080;&#1085;&#1086;&#1073;&#1086;&#1088;&#1089;&#1090;&#1074;&#1072;]] [[sv:Kampsport]] [[sr:&#1041;&#1086;&#1088;&#1080;&#1083;&#1072;&#1095;&#1082;&#1072; &#1074;&#1077;&#1096;&#1090;&#1080;&#1085;&#1072;]] [[zh:%E6%AD%A6%E6%9C%AF]]<br/>+ur gay harry</td>

These files are produced by the [[Unix-like|Unix]] command <code>tar</code> and were standardized by [[POSIX]].1-1998 and later POSIX.1-2001. It is used to collate collections of files into one larger file, while preserving [[file system]] information such as user and group permissions, dates, and [[directory]] structures.<br/>+<br/>+<code>tar</code> was originally developed for use with [[sequential access]] devices such as [[tape drive]]s, specifically for [[backup]] purposes.  However, it is now more frequently used as a general [[archive]] utility.  <code>tar</code>'s linear roots can still be seen in its ability to work on any data stream and its slow partial extraction performance, as it has to read through the whole archive to extract only the final file.  A tar file (somefile.tar), when subsequently compressed using a zip utility such as gzip or bzip, produces a zipped tar file with a filename extension of .tar.gz  (somefile.tar.gz) or .tar.bz2 (somefile.tar.bz2), and is then referred to as a '''''tarball'''''.<br/>+<br/>+As is common with Unix utilities, <code>tar</code> is a single specialist program. It follows the [[Unix philosophy]] in that it can ''"do only one thing"'' (archive), ''"but do it well"''. <code>tar</code> is most commonly used in tandem with an external compression utility such as [[gzip]], [[bzip2]] or, formerly, [[compress]], since it has no built-in [[data compression]] facilities. These compression utilities generally only compress a single file, hence the pairing with tar, which can produce a single file from many files. To speed this, the [[BSD]] and [[GNU]] versions of tar support the command line options <code>-z</code> (gzip), <code>-j</code> (bzip2), and <code>-Z</code> (compress), which will compress or decompress the archive file it is currently working with, although even in this case the (de)compression is still actually performed by an external program. Compression is sometimes avoided because of the greatly amplified potential for damage to data in long term storage.<br/>+<br/>+==Usage==<br/>+===On the command line===<br/>+*'''To ''pack'' tar files''', use the following commands:<br/>+**for an ''uncompressed'' tar file:<br/>+**:<code>tar -cf <var>packed_files.tar</var> <var>file_to_pack1</var> <var>file_to_pack2</var> <var>...</var></code><br/>+**to pack ''and'' compress (one step at a time):<br/>+**:<code>tar -cf <var>packed_files.tar</var> <var>file_to_pack1</var> <var>file_to_pack2</var> <var>...</var><br />gzip <var>packed_files.tar</var></code><br/>+**to pack and compress ''all at once'':<br/>+**:<code>tar -cf - <var>file_to_pack1</var> <var>file_to_pack2</var> <var>...</var> | gzip -c &gt; <var>packed_files.tar.gz</var></code><br/>+**to create a tar from a directory and its subdirectories:<br/>+**:<code>tar -cvf <var>packed_files.tar</var> <var>dir_to_pack</var></code><br/>+* '''To ''unpack'' tar files''', use the following commands:<br/>+** for an ''uncompressed'' tar file:<br/>+*::<code>tar -xf <var>file_to_unpack.tar</var></code><br/>+**to decompress and unpack one step at a time:<br/>+**:<code>gunzip <var>packed_files.tar.gz</var><br />tar -xf <var>packed_files.tar</var></code><br/>+**to decompress and unpack ''all at once'':<br/>+**:<code>gunzip -c <var>packed_files.tar.gz</var> | tar -xf -</code><br/>+* '''To ''list the contents'' of a tar file''', use the following command:<br/>+*::<code>tar -tvf <var>file_to_list.tar</var></code><br/>+<br/>+To use ''bzip2'' instead of ''gzip'', simply replace the commands above with <code>bzip2</code> where <code>gzip</code> is used and <code>bunzip2</code> where <code>gunzip</code> is used.<br/>+<br/>+====BSD & GNU compression options====<br/>+[[BSD]] and [[GNU]] tar have a '''compression flag feature''' making it easier to archive and compress ''gzip''ped, ''bzip''ped or ''compress''ed tarballs in one go.

As a result data in tar files is arranged in 512 byte blocks.<br/>+<br/>+A tar file is the concatenation of one or more files.  Each file is preceded by a [[Header (information technology)|header]] block.

The end of an archive is marked by at least two consecutive zero-filled blocks.<br/>+<br/>+===File header===<br/>+The file header block contains [[metadata]] about a file.  To ensure portability across different architectures with different [[Endianness|byte orderings]], the information in the header block is encoded in [[ASCII]].

The final character is either a [[null]] or a [[Space (punctuation)|space]].  Thus although there are 12 bytes reserved for storing the file size, only 11 octal digits can be stored.  This gives a maximum file size of 8 [[gigabyte]]s on archived files.  To overcome this limitation some versions of tar, including the [[GNU]] implementation, support an extension in which the file size is encoded in binary.<br/>+<br/>+The checksum is calculated by taking the sum of the byte values of the header block ''with the eight checksum bytes taken to be ascii spaces'' (value 32).

Older tar programs will ignore the extra information, while newer programs will test for the presence of the "ustar" string to determine if the new format is in use.

They are ''nul'' characters.<br/>+<br/>+==Tarbombs==<br/>+<br/>+Tarbomb is the slang term used to refer to a tarball containing files that untar to the current directory instead of untarring into a directory of its own.<br/>+<br/>+For example:<br/>+<br/>+ $ tar zxvf urchin5703_redhat_ent3.tar.gz<br/>+ gunzip<br/>+ inspector<br/>+ install.sh<br/>+ install.txt<br/>+ license.txt<br/>+ README<br/>+ urchin.tar.gz<br/>+ $ pwd<br/>+ /home/suso<br/>+<br/>+In the above example, all the files are untarred into the directory that the user is currently in.  It should have untarred into a directory called 'urchin' or something similar. This can be a potential problem if it overwrites files using the same name in the current directory. It can also be a pain for the user who then needs to delete all the files that are scattered over the directory amongst other files.  Often times this ends up happening in the user's home directory.<br/>+<br/>+To protect yourself against tarbombs, you should always use the 't' action/option first to list the files contained in the archive before using the 'x' option to extract.  Here is an example:<br/>+<br/>+ tar ztvf tarfile.tar.gz<br/>+<br/>+To prevent making tarbombs when you create a tar file, create a working directory for all the files and directories that you want in the tar file and then move into the parent directory and run the following:<br/>+<br/>+ tar zcvf tarfile.tar.gz directory_name_you_want_to_tar<br/>+<br/>+For programs, a common convention is to call the directory by the name of the program followed by a hyphen and then the version of the program in the directory.  For example.<br/>+<br/>+ mkdir randomsig-1.9<br/>+ mv workingdir/* randomsig-1.9/<br/>+ tar zcvf randomsig-1.9.tar.gz randomsig-1.9<br/>+<br/>+This way when a user downloads your program and untars it, it will not overwrite older versions of the same program or other important files in her current or other directories.<br/>+<br/>+==Notes==<br/>+<br/>+<references /><br/>+<br/>+==See also==<br/>+*[[ar (Unix)|ar]]<br/>+*[[shar]]<br/>+*[[CPIO|cpio]]<br/>+*[[pax (program)|pax]]<br/>+*[[gzip]]<br/>+*[[ZIP (file format)|Zip]]<br/>+*[[List of archive formats]]<br/>+*[[List of file archivers]]<br/>+*[[Comparison of file archivers]]<br/>+*[[List of Unix programs]]<br/>+*[[.tar.gz.gpg]]<br/>+<br/>+==External links==<br/>+*[http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/ Official website of GNU tar]<br/>+*[http://savannah.gnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/*checkout*/tar/tar/src/tar.h?content-type=text/plain The file 'tar.h' from GNU tar]<br/>+*[http://www.7-zip.org/ 7-Zip] is an [[LGPL]] licensed utility that supports several compression formats including [[Gzip|GZIP]], [[Bzip2|BZIP2]] and [[Tar file format|TAR]].<br/>+*[http://www.mkssoftware.com/docs/man4/tar.4.asp Detailed information on tar and USTAR file headers]<br/>+*[http://www.linuxtecharticles.com/viewarticle.php?name=Typical%20Tar linux tar command simplified]<br/>+*[http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tar tar(1) man page] via [[OpenBSD]]<br/>+<br/>+[[Category:Archive formats]]<br/>+[[Category:Unix software]]<br/>+[[Category:Package management systems]]<br/>+<br/>+[[ca:Tar]]<br/>+[[de:Tar]]<br/>+[[es:Tar]]<br/>+[[fr:Tar (informatique)]]<br/>+[[it:TAR (software)]]<br/>+[[ja:Tar]]<br/>+[[pt:TAR]]</td>

"McCosker ... caught Knott ... bowled Greig, Headingley '77." Russell himself has commented: "Low down, one handed, across first slip. Brilliant. I thought then that I would like to be able to do that. That's where it started, that was the inspiration '(for becoming a Wicket Keeper)'."<br/>+<br/>+The other inspiration was the death of his brother David. Until that time, Jack was a borderline dipsomaniac, who would keep the night porter busy. But the tragic death of his brother, who died of a brain haemorrhage following high jinks during a night out, changed all that and Russell quickly dedicated himself to going as far as his talent would take him. Resultantly, he drank very little during his career.<br/>+<br/>+Rutter guided Russell towards [[Gloucestershire County Cricket Club]], and resultantly Russell stayed at Archway for one year of Sixth Form college, before heading to Bristol Technical College for one term and joining Gloucestershire full time in 1981.<br/>+<br/>+==County and Test Career==<br/>+Jack Russell was on the wrong end of many controversial Test selections, frequently being passed over in favour of [[Alec Stewart]] on account of his superior batting ability. However, his wicket-keeping was second-to-none. He could also be a unorthodox but resolute lower-order batsman - his unbeaten 29 in 277 minutes at [[Johannesburg]] in 1995-96 is often forgotten, an innings which, along with that of [[Michael Atherton]], saved the Test.<br/>+<br/>+In 1990, he was [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden's]] Cricketer of the Year. As Wisden's put it:<br/>+<br/>+:''At the beginning of 1989, Jack Russell had played only one Test for England and was not considered a good enough batsman to merit a place in the one-day squad to face the Australians. By the end of the year he was the only Englishman who could justifiably expect a place in anyone's World XI.''<br/>+<br/>+Why? Simply put, dogged determination. It was his batting that got the fan's on their feet - not the high scores, but the dogged determination to stay and grit it out agianst the Aussie's, who in the first Test of the 1989 Ashes had thought Russell weak. So, with mentor Alan Knot, Russell turned up early for the second Test at Lord's and for 20mins had the MCC Ground Staff boys chuck plastic ball's at him - without Russell batting a stroke, just ducking and diving to miss the short-type deliveries. That day, Russell also turned on his sharpest Anglo-Saxon language in response to the Aussie's sledging - and after scoring 64n.o., the Aussie's never tried it with him again: Russel had crosssed the rubicon of international cricket, and never looked back. In the third Test at Edgbaston, he scored the second highest score in the first inning at 42. But his greatest achievement was to come in the fourth Test at Old Trafford, where in the summer of the South African cricket rebels and a near certain defeat, for six hours he held up Aussie celebration by scoring his maiden Test century and highest ever score in cricket to almost save the Test for England: 126. Russell had achieved something only one other Englishman had this century, Billy Griffith against West Indies in 1947-48 - but it was lost in the furor of the South African debacle, and the loss of the series. Russell finished the Ashes series as England's third most successful batsman with 314 runs and an average of 39.25.<br/>+<br/>+The summer of 1989 gave Russell a run in the England side, but his batting never reached such scoring heights again, and the game was moving forward in a new era of revolving score boards - 6hour stands for 29 was not what was required, however good you were behind the stumps. For reasons of balance and depth of batting, and with his wicket keeping alomsot as good, Alec Stewart often got the gloves ahead of Russel due to his superior batting. Russell was often called up when Engalnd need a good man behind the stumps, but slowly he faded away until 1998, when he curtailed his England career to prolong his County career due to his long standing back injury.<br/>+<br/>+Russell turned himself into part of the hub of Gloucestershire's one day sucess, wnad together with Captain Mark Alleyne won a couple of ODI cups. After an inconsistent season due to persistent back problems, he retired from county cricket in 2004, just short of the age of 41 - a testament to his fitness regime. He was probably at the time still the best Wicket Keeper in the world when stood up.<br/>+<br/>+==The Eccentric==<br/>+Jack was never seen as a true team player, a perception reinforced by his being a loner off the field, his indulgence of his hobby of [[Water_color | water colour]] [[painting]], and his protective attitude to his family life. None of his Gloucestershire team-mates had even been to his home, and he claimed if they ever asked he would be more than willing if they agreed to be blind folded. Some of his more notable oddities included a diet to supplement his extreme fitness regieme, which consisted largely of tea, biscuits and baked beans - and that he only ate Steak & Chips when dining out on tour. He also insisted on always wearing the same battered old sunhat during his time out in the field.<br/>+<br/>+==After Retirement from Cricket==<br/>+After his mentorship from [[Alan Knott]] throughout his own career, Russell was highly unlikely to back away completely from cricket. He now provides one-to-one coaching for current England wicketkeeper [[Geraint Jones]], as well as some county level coaching at Gloucestershire.<br/>+<br/>+However his second passion of painting, a piece developed on the England tour of India in 1984/5, and supplemented by sketchbook, pencil and camera: had by now taken over fully. From exhibitions in London and his own Gallery in [[Chipping Sodbury]], to commissions from various sponsors, he can often be found painting sights and scenes of his home area in Stroud.<br/>+<br/>+==Trivia==<br/>+* Like his mentor [[Alan Knott]], a mad tea drinker, Russell would get through 20 cups a day. He used to dip the tea bag in once, add plenty of milk, then hang it on a nail ready for subsequent use. In the final Test against Australia at the Oval in 1989 he used the same bag for all five days, which roughly equates to 100 cups<br/>+* Chicken without skin was a favourite meal - Russell once spent every night of a Test at a Chinese restaurant in [[Perth]], ordering cashew chicken: without the cashews<br/>+* For lunch, Russell would eat two [[Weetabix]], soaked for exactly eight minutes in milk, and a mashed banana<br/>+* While driving between games, Russell would be clad in a sleeping bag with the bottom cut out, so as not to get a chill in his back and legs. He also had a block fitted beneath the accelerator, so as to avoid over-stretching the Achilles tendon<br/>+* His hat was infamous. It ended up a rather bedraggled and worn out old thing, but Russell lined up the ball with the specially cut back rim. It caused more than one argument with the authorities, and was the bane of Mike Atherton's life during his period of captaincy<br/>+<br/>+==External Links==<br/>+* [http://www.jackrussell.co.uk/index.htm The Jack Russell Gallery] contains notes on his domestic and Test cricket records<br/>+* [http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/154432.html Wisden Almanack - Cricketer of the Year 1990]<br/>+<br/>+{{England-cricketbio-stub}}<br/>+<br/>+[[Category:1963 births|Russell, Jack]]<br/>+[[Category:Living people|Russell, Jack]]<br/>+[[Category:English ODI cricketers|Russell, Jack]]<br/>+[[Category:English Test cricketers|Russell, Jack]]<br/>+[[Category:English cricketers|Russell, Jack]]<br/>+[[Category:English wicket-keepers|Russell, Jack]]<br/>+[[Category:Gloucestershire cricketers|Russell, Jack]]<br/>+[[Category:Wisden Cricketers of the Year|Russell, Jack]]</td>

Lincoln Lab is located at [[Hanscom Field]] in the town of [[Lexington, Massachusetts]], and was founded in [[1951]].<br/> <br/>-'''The Timekeeper''' was a [[Circle-Vision 360°]] film that has been performed at three [[Disney parks]] around the world. Unlike previous Circle-Vision films, it was the first show that was arranged and filmed with an actual plot and not just visions of landscapes, and the first to utilize [[Audio-Animatronics]].<br/>+In 1950, MIT undertook a summer study, named Project Charles, to explore the feasibility of establishing a major laboratory focused on air defense. The summer study recommended the establishment of a laboratory, named Project Lincoln, (later renamed Lincoln Laboratory) to be operated by MIT for the Army, Navy and Air Force. In the early years, the most important developments to come out of Lincoln Lab were [[Semi Automatic Ground Environment|SAGE]] (Semi-Automatic Ground Environment), a nationwide network of radar and anti-aircraft weapons linked to digital computers conceived by professor George E. Valley, and the [[DEW Line]] (Distant Early Warning Line), a radar surveillance system placed along the polar gateway to the United States.<br/> <br/>-==History==<br/>-"Le Visionarium" (the original title) was not just an ordinary Circle-Vision 360° film, but was important in the fact that for the first time in a Circle-Vision film, that creators at Walt Disney Imagineering wanted to tell a immersive story and attempt a light-hearted dialogue without just switching between scenes of landscapes, as had been done in all of the previous Circle-Vision films. <br/>+== External links ==<br/>+*[http://www.ll.mit.edu/ MIT Lincoln Laboratory home page]<br/> <br/>-The original concept for the film had included Jules Verne and the culture of past and present European history and events, and new inventions. ALong with the previous elements, the story had to do with the idea of time travel with one concept including a child that explored the story of the great European scientists of the past on a computer.

It was an extravagant attraction and was touted by then-Disney [[CEO]] [[Michael Eisner]] as the showcase of the land at the time. The attraction had long been on the 'New Tomorrowland' proposal for the [[Magic Kingdom]]. It opened as "From Time to Time" on [[November 21]], [[1994]] as part of the [[Tomorrowland|New Tomorrowland]] expansion. It opened in the "Tomorrowland Metropolis Science Center" and enjoyed a long run.A few months after it opened, the attraction was formally known as ''The Timekeeper''. The same year, the third incarnation of the ride opened at [[Tokyo Disneyland]], closing in [[2002]].<br/>-[[Image:Wdwtimekeeper.gif|The Timekeeper|left|200px|thumb]]<br/>-<br/>-In 2001, the attraction was moved to the seasonal list of attractions along with Walt Disney's [[Carousel of Progress]]. In February 2006, the Walt Disney World Resort reported that The Timekeeper was to be closed on [[February 26]], [[2006]]. Walt Disney World's version was the last version of the attraction to be closed. Both the Tokyo Disneyland and Disneyland Paris "Visionarium" films had closed in 2002 and 2004, respectively. <br/>-<br/>-<br/>-==Synopsis==<br/>-{{spoiler}}<br/>-<br/>-Before the actual show, we are introduced to one of the hosts of the show, "Circumvisual PhotoDroid", more commonly known as "9-Eye", voiced by [[Rhea Perlman]]. The nine eyes she has represents the nine cameras used in filming the show in the round, thus showing the view from one of her "eyes" on each of the nine movie screens. She is the latest development from The Timekeeper, the keeper of the time machine. Guests are invited to be witnesses of the first ever use of the newly invented Time Machine. <br/>-<br/>-After guests enter the theater, Timekeeper comes to life and has "9-Eye" prepare for the journey through time. Timekeeper then turns on the Machine for its first use, then watches from his control panel as 9-Eye is thrust back to the [[Triassic|Triassic age]] period in Earth's history. She narrowly escapes hungry [[dinosaurs]] as Timekeeper sends her to the last great [[ice age]] about 12,000 years ago. As she starts to freeze up sends her to [[1450]], for what is to be demonstration of [[Johann Gutenberg]]'s printing press.<br/>-<br/>-However, Timekeeper has yet again messed up and sent her to a Scottish battle field in which one warrior comes after her, but is saved by Timekeeper. Finally working the kinks out of the time machine, Timekeeper sends 9-Eye to the year [[1503]], at the height of the Renaissance. The machine has placed right in the middle of [[Leonardo DaVinci]]'s workshop where he is painting the [[Mona Lisa]]. 9-Eye, being curious starts to pick up some of the painting supplies and is noticed by DaVinci who becomes fascinated by the strange machine.<br/>-<br/>-However the meeting between 9-Eye and DaVinci is cut short as her next stop in time is [[1763]], where [[Mozart]] is giving a performance to a crowd, which includes [[Louis the Sixteenth]]. However the meeting is again short as she is noticed by the people who begin to chase her through a house. Timekeeper decides to send her to the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)]] but the machine is stuck on fast forward with a skyline of Paris in such a motion that the progress of the Eiffle Tower, symbol of the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)]], is shown in the background. Finally Timekeeper has the machine stop in 1900, just in time for the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)]]. <br/>-<br/>-Timekeeper announces that guests are in time for a meeting between [[H.G. Wells]] and [[Jules Verne]]. 9-Eye hides from the fair-goers but not so that Verne and Wells are hidden. After a brief meeting, Wells walks away leaving with Verne a model of his time machine, which Verne had just criticized to him as impossible. After a sarcastic comment about time travel from Verne, 9-Eye rebuts his claim, and Verne notices her. Jules Verne decides to take a closer look at 9-Eye and tries to grab her. Timekeeper seeing this tries to bring her back to the present but brings not only her back but Verne.<br/>-<br/>-Timekeeper and 9-Eye realizing their mistake try to send him back, but he refuses after discovering he is finally in the future and begs for them to show him the world of today in 10 minutes or less, so he can return to 1900 and deliver his speech. They agree and Timekeeper sets the machine for today. He sends Verne and 9-Eye to a dark tunnel, which Verne believes to be a dark future, however they are unaware they are standing in a railroad tunnel. The next thing to happen is a collision between Jules Verne and a French [[TGV]] train, and Verne becomes a new hood ornament. <br/>-<br/>-From the train, Jules Verne and 9-Eye explore the modern roads of Paris with cars, which leads Verne, curious, to try driving. However Timekeeper puts him in the front seat of a [[race car]], and Verne takes off, albeit in the wrong direction. From race car driving, Verne then enjoys a bobsled run. After the [[bobsled]] run, Timekeeper sends Verne and 9-Eye to the bottom of the sea, to show Verne how his novel "[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]" has come to life. <br/>-<br/>-The scene changes and going from under water to flying. The screen now shows a flight through the air above the European countrysides featuring castles and mountains. Vernes is shown in a [[helicopter]], sitting dangerously close to its open door. After a view of English countrysides and New York skylines, Verne requests to go even higher. They take him to space to show that another one of his ideas, space travel, has come true from his books ([[From the Earth to the Moon]]). <br/>-<br/>-Time is running out so Timekeeper and 9-Eye return Verne to the site of the [[Grand Palais]] of [[Exposition Universelle (1900)]], however Timekeeper makes one mistake in the wrong year, and Verne is in the right place, but wrong time. They finally return Verne to right place, and at the same time H.G. Wells returns and sees all that is going on. Wells is flabbergasted, and Verne and 9-Eye exchange goodbyes as Wells tries to understand what is happening. 9-Eye returns to the present time, and Timekeeper decides now that the guests have witnessed a "flawless" demonstration of his time machine he decides to see the future.<br/>-[[Image:Tdlvisionariuminterior.gif|thumb|right|250px|Finale Scene from Timekeeper]]<br/>-Timekeeper sends 9-Eye to [[2189]], 300 years after Exposition Universelle of 1889 and the completion of the Eiffle Tower. As they explore a futuristic Paris, they see many flying cars. The flying family car was built by [[Renault]], original sponsor of the French version, "Le Visionarium" from 1992 until 2002; and called a [[Renault Reinastella]]. Then Jules Verne and H.G. Wells appear in what looks like a model of Well's time machine from 1900. After they jet off the show ends, and Timekeeper wishes everyone well. As guest leave, Timekeeper makes plans to see [[Christopher Columbus]] (before he got to Ohio), [[Sigmund Freud]] (and say "Oedipus Schmedipus!"), and the [[Library at Alexandria]].<br/>-<br/>-===Cast===<br/>-*[[Robin Williams]] - Timekeeper (Voice - American Version)<br/>-*Michel Leeb - Timekeeper (Voice - French Version)<br/>-*[[Rhea Perlman]] - 9-Eye (Voice - American Version)<br/>-*Myriam Boyer - 9-Eye (Voice - French Version)<br/>-*[[Michel Piccoli]] - Jules Verne<br/>-*[[Jeremy Irons]] - H.G.

A certain number of scenes were cut including a hot air balloon scene, more [[European]] coastlines, and a dialogue between ground crew and Jules Verne at Paris' [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]] in front of an [[Air France]] [[Concorde]] and a [[Union des Transports Aériens|UTA]] [[DC-10]] nearby. The only addition to the American version was a [[New York City]] skyline scene. Also cut from the American version, was a balloon ride over [[Red Square]] scene that was taken under intense conditions with by Walt Disney Productions in the then-[[Soviet Union]].<br/>-<br/>-==Aftermath==<br/>-The Timekeeper attraction in [[Walt Disney World Resort]] was the last Timekeeper still entertaining guests, as the [[Tokyo Disneyland]] version closed in [[2002]] and was replaced with [[Buzz Lightyear's Astro Blasters]] in [[2004]] and the [[Disneyland Paris]] version closed in [[2004]] and is now being renovated for [[Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast]] with an opening date of [[April]] [[2006]]. After being placed on a seasonal schedule in [[2001]], The Timekeeper was open on a sporatic schedule during the busy seasons. During the time when construction was occuring on [[Stitch's Great Escape]], it was open more frequently along with Walt Disney's [[Carousel of Progress]]. On days when the show was not opened, the queue was a meet-and-greet for such Disney characters as Stitch and [[Pixar]] characters [[Buzz Lightyear]] and [[The Incredibles]].<br/>-<br/>-As for the Walt Disney World version, several rumors are abound on Disney-fan sites as to what the new attraction might. A strong possibility is that the new show or ride  will be based on popular [[Pixar]] films. One plan is that a ride with a plot revolving around the film, ''[[The Incredibles]]'' is rumored to be replacing The Timekeeper. However, some sites are reporting that a remake of the ill-fated 1960s attraction from Disneyland, "Flying Saucers", might be rebuilt indoors with a theme featuring the little green aliens from ''[[Toy Story]]''. Another plan has a dark ride featuring characters from the film ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'', similiar to the [[Monsters, Inc. Mike & Sulley to the Rescue!]] ride at [[Disney's California Adventure]], being considered by officials.Another rumor would be a show just like Turtle Talk With Crush. But you would Interact with Mike Wazowski from [[Monsters Inc]]<br/>-<br/>-==Failed Proposal for Fourth Version==<br/>-During the early 1990s, former Disney-Executive, [[Michael Eisner]] released ambitious plans for changes to the parks. "Tomorrowland 2055" was plan for a remake of [[Tomorrowland]] and the [[Disneyland Resort]] in [[California]]. The Timekeeper, along with ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter and Plectu's Fantastic Intergalactic Revue, was to be a showcase attraction. One promotional brochure had [[Delta Air Lines]] sponsoring the film. But the plans were later scrapped due to financial difficulties within the Parks & Resorts division. <br/>-<br/>-When the new Tomorrowland finally reopened after being renovated in [[1998]], the plan for The Timekeeper to be part of the new land had already been obviously dropped from the plan. As the theater it was to be showcased inside of had already become the new queue area for the ill-fated [[Rocket Rods]] attraction. <br/>-<br/>-Other information placed "Visionarium" as an opening day attraction at the unbuilt park next to Disneyland, [[WestCOT]]. The show would have been housed in a European Renaissance building in a European section of the WestCOT version of World Showcase. However, like the New Tomorrowland plan, this also did not occur.<br/>-<br/>-==Attraction Facts==<br/>-=== Magic Kingdom attraction facts===<br/>-* '''Grand opening:''' [[November 21]], [[1994]]<br/>-* '''Seasonal operation:''' Started [[April 29]], [[2001]]<br/>-* '''Closing Date:''' [[February 26]], [[2006]]<br/>-* '''Designer:''' [[Walt Disney Imagineering]]<br/>-* '''Slogan:''' The Timekeeper would love to take the time to take you on a trip through TIME!!! <br/>-* '''Previous attractions:'''<br/>-** "America the Beautiful" [[November 25]], [[1971]] - [[March 15]], [[1974]] & [[March 15]], [[1975]] - [[September 9]], [[1984]]<br/>-** "Magic Carpet ‘Round the World" [[March 16]], [[1974]] - [[March 14]], [[1975]]<br/>-** "American Journeys" [[September 15]], [[1984]] - [[January 9]], [[1994]]<br/>-* '''Show length:''' 20 minutes<br/>-* '''Ride system:''' [[Circle-Vision 360°]] theater<br/>-<br/>-=== Disneyland Park, Paris attraction facts===<br/>-* '''Grand opening:''' [[April 12]], [[1992]]<br/>-* '''Closing Date:''' [[September 5]], [[2004]]<br/>-* '''Designer:''' [[Walt Disney Imagineering]]<br/>-* '''Slogan:''' Un Voyage A Travers Le Temps.<br/>-* '''Previous sponsor:''' [[Renault]]<br/>-* '''Future attractions:'''<br/>-** "[[Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast]]" [[2006]] -<br/>-* '''Show length:''' 20 minutes<br/>-* '''Ride system:''' [[Circle-Vision 360°]] theater<br/>-<br/>-=== Tokyo Disneyland attraction facts===<br/>-* '''Grand opening:''' [[1993]]<br/>-* '''Closing Date:''' [[September]], [[2002]]<br/>-* '''Designer:''' [[Walt Disney Imagineering]]<br/>-* '''Previous sponsor:''' [[Fujifilm]]<br/>-* '''Previous attractions:'''<br/>-** "Magic Carpet ‘Round the World" [[1983]] - [[1986]]<br/>-** "American Journeys" [[1986]] - [[1994]]<br/>-* '''Future attractions:'''<br/>-** "[[Buzz Lightyear's Astro Blasters]]" [[2004]] -<br/>-* '''Show length:''' 20 minutes<br/>-* '''Ride system:''' [[Circle-Vision 360°]] theater<br/>-<br/>-==Technical Aspects==<br/>-* Film negative format (mm/video inches)<br/>-** 9 x 35 mm<br/>-*Cinematographic process<br/>-** Circle-Vision 360<br/>-*Printed film format<br/>-** 9 x 35 mm<br/>-*Aspect ratio<br/>-** 12.00 : 1<br/>-<br/>-==Trivia==<br/>-* The flying car carrying a family from the scene of Paris in the future was made by [[Renault]] and called a "Reinastella".

The story tells of the adventures of [[Kagome Higurashi]], who can travel back in time through a mysterious well, and the half-[[demon]], InuYasha, along with their companions Miroku (a monk who accompanies Inuyasha to defeat the demon lord Naraku, to rid himself of the [[black hole]] in his hand), Sango (a demon slayer wanting revenge on Naraku for the death of her brother and village) and Shippo (an orphan fox demon). The whole group travels together, seeking to kill Naraku as revenge and gather all the shards of the sacred jewel (Shikon no Tama, which was broken accidentally by Kagome) to keep them out of the hands of demons. It was adapted into an 167 episode anime series produced by [[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]] which first aired on [[Nippon TV]] in Japan from [[16 October]] [[2000]] to [[13 September]] [[2004]]. The television run of the anime ceased without a conclusion to the story. The manga is still being released in Japan as of today.<br/>-<br/>-The series is named after the main character, InuYasha. The name "InuYasha" literally means "dog demon". ''[[wiktionary:inu|Inu]]'' (犬) is a Japanese word meaning "dog". [[Yaksha|Yasha]] (夜叉) can be translated to "demonic warrior".<br/>-<br/>-== Plot ==<br/>-{{main|Plot of InuYasha}}<br/>-{{spoiler}}<br/>-[[Image:InuyashaDualLogo.JoshG.png|left|200px|The Japanese & English ''InuYasha'' logos]]<br/>-The story begins in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]] with a junior high-school girl named [[Kagome Higurashi]], who, on her way to school, heads to the covered well on the family property (which happens to be a [[Shinto]] shrine). She does this to retrieve her cat, Buyo, from the well, since her brother was afraid to go inside. When she approaches the well a centipede demon bursts from the well and grabs her. The demon claims that Kagome possesses the [[Jewel of the Four Souls]] (四魂の玉 ''Shikon no Tama'') and attempts to seize it. When the demon is driven off, the very confused Kagome emerges in the [[Sengoku period]] of Japan. Kagome wanders into a colossal forest looking for landmarks that she may recognize. She spots the Sacred Tree off in the distance and proceeds to run towards it, where she finds Inuyasha, who is still sealed with an arrow to the tree. He is asleep. Villagers seize her and take her to a nearby village where she meets an old [[miko]] ([[Shinto]] shrine maiden) by the name of [[Kaede (Inuyasha)|Kaede]], who recognizes that Kagome is almost a mirror likeness for [[Kikyo]] (Kikyou), her elder sister (and powerful shrine maiden) who had died at the age of 17 and had her body burned with the Jewel of the Four Souls, taking it with her into the afterlife. Kaede relates the story of how, 50 years earlier, a [[hanyo|han'yō]] named [[InuYasha (character)|InuYasha]] had tried to steal the Jewel from Kikyo, mortally wounding her in the process, but Kikyo had managed to strike him with a magical arrow, pinning him into an enchanted sleep against a tree and thus retrieving the Jewel before she finally died. It is later shown that Inuyasha had a relationship with the priestess Kikyo and it was not him that tried to steal the jewel but Naraku, an evil character bent on destroying Kikyo, Inuyasha, and many other people. Inuyasha must fight his half brother [[Sesshomaru]] because he wants to kill Inuyasha for their father's sword, [[Tetsusaiga]].<br/>-<br/>-==Characters==<br/>-{{main|InuYasha characters}}<br/>-{{main|InuYasha yōkai list}}<br/>-The plot focuses mainly on [[Kagome Higurashi|Kagome]] and [[InuYasha (character)|InuYasha]] and their expanding group of friends, mainly Miroku, Shippo and Sango as they seek the shards of the Shikon Jewel of the Four Souls. The television show will occasionally skip over to the lives of the antagonists, minor characters or modern-day people as a way of setting up a plot, or clarifying a point. Flashbacks are occasionally used to the same effect. Shippo is a young fox demon who occasionally squabbles with Inuyasha, which tends to end with a bonk on the head and a "Sit!" on Kagome's part. Miroku is a rather lecherous monk armed with spell scrolls and his trusty spiritual staff, as well as his "Kazaana (Wind Tunnel)", an other-dimensional black hole embedded into his right palm. Sango is the beautiful but very sensible demon exterminator with a giant boomerang-like weapon (Hiraikotsu) and Kirara, her cat-demon companion who transforms from innocent kitten to formidable flaming feline.<br/>-<br/>-==Terminology==<br/>-* [[Hanyo]] - commonly translated as "half-demon".

As a series overall, more than 800,000 DVDs of the INUYASHA series have been sold since March 2003.<br/>-<br/>-On the literary side, INU-YASHA graphic novels also continue to show strong sales numbers. The recently released Volume 19 of the INU-YASHA manga series has been ranked Number 3 on Nielsen Bookscan’s Graphic Novel Top 50 List for the week ending October 3, and Volume 1 is at Number 18 in its 77th straight week on top, confirming a growing interest among new fans.<br/>-[http://www.anime-tourist.com/article.php?sid=865]<br/>-<br/>-===Production broadcast history===<br/>-The ''InuYasha'' anime series spanned 167 episodes, and was broadcast across [[Japan]] by the anime television network, [[Animax]], who have also aired the series across its English-language network in [[South Asia]] (being the first network to fully broadcast the series in the English language) and also across its networks in [[East Asia]], and [[Nippon Television]].

Cartoon Network LA can be seen in many countries south of the United States, as well as some [[cruise ship]]s in the [[Caribbean]]. It is unknown if the last 7 episodes will air dubbed in the region.<br/>-<br/>-At one point [in Japan], new episodes of Inuyasha were airing twice a day, 5 times a week, and reruns were being aired Saturday night - 5 episodes in two hours. This is why the series concluded much faster than in the United States. Inuyasha is on rotation on the network, and the official site should be visited to see if the show is currently re-airing.<br/>-<br/>-In the United States, the final episode of InuYasha aired on [[October 27]], [[2006]].

Variant spellings include "InuYasha", "Inuyasha", "Inu-Yasha", "Inu-yasha", "Inu Yasha", and "Inu yasha". Fans of the series often use "IY" (or simply, "Inu"), especially on fansites, although it is usually considered to be more of an abbreviation than an actual name. Official licensors use varying spellings, so they provide little guidance in this area; the two most popular versions are "Inuyasha" and the VIZ [[CamelCase]] version (InuYasha).<br/>-<br/>-==Critical reception==<br/>-[[Image:ShikonNoTama.jpg|thumb|The Jewel of the Four Souls.]]<br/>-Critics are found to agree that the artwork in both the anime and manga versions of ''InuYasha'' is quite impressive<ref>{{cite web<br/>-| url = http://animeworld.com/readerreviews/inuyashatv.html<br/>-| title = Reader Review: Inuyasha TV Series<br/>-| accessdate = 2006-08-19<br/>-| author = Animonster<br/>-| date = [[2003-03-13]]<br/>-| publisher = Akemi's Anime World<br/>-}}</ref>, such as [[Anime News Network]] praising it as "''excellent''".<ref>{{cite web<br/>-| url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/reviews/display.php?id=26<br/>-| title = Preview: Inu-Yasha<br/>-| accessdate =  2006-08-19<br/>-| last = Harris<br/>-| first = Alexander<br/>-| publisher = Anime News Network<br/>-}}</ref> However, some viewers, such as Derrick Tucker, from THEM Anime Reviews, complain that some action scenes are often reused and that sometimes a static image moved against a background is used as a substitute for animation.

The story is also accused of running too long with many irrelevant characters, storylines, and battles with no substantial character development involved. Many believe such irrelevant battles and storylines to be filler. The anime is also criticized for abruptly ending mid-story with no conclusion (in terms of Naraku's demise) after 167 episodes.<br/>+{{redirect|Stanford}}<br/>+The '''Leland Stanford Junior University''', commonly known as '''Stanford University''' (or simply '''Stanford'''), is a [[private university]] located approximately 37 miles (60 kilometers) southeast of [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] and approximately 20 miles northwest of [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] in an [[unincorporated]] part of [[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara County]]. Adjacent to the city of [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]], [[California]], [[USA]], Stanford lies at the heart of the [[Silicon Valley]], both geographically and historically.<br/>+<br/>+Situated on one of the largest university campuses in the nation, the University comprises the Schools of [[Engineering]], [[Law]], [[Medicine]], [[Education]], [[Business]], [[Earth Sciences]], and [[Humanities]] and [[Sciences]]. Stanford hosts programs and a [[teaching hospital]] in addition to various community outreach and volunteer initiatives.<br/>+<br/>+==History==<br/>+Stanford was founded by [[railroad]] magnate and [[Governor of California|California Governor]] [[Leland Stanford]] and his wife, [[Jane Stanford]]. It is named in honor of their only child, [[Leland Stanford, Jr.]], who died of [[typhoid]] just before his 16th birthday. On the morning of their son's death, Leland Sr. is said to have said to his wife, “The Children of California shall be our children.”<br/>+Locals and university affiliates are known to refer to the school as '''The Farm''', a nod to the fact that the university is located on the former site of Leland Stanford's horse farm.<br/>+[[Image:StanfordLibrary-1906.jpg|thumb|right|The ruins of Stanford Library after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake]]<br/>+The University's founding grant was written on [[November 11]], [[1885]], and accepted by the first Board of Trustees on [[November 14]]. The cornerstone was laid on [[May 14]], [[1887]], and the University officially opened on [[October 1]], [[1891]], to 559 students, with free tuition and 15 faculty members, seven of whom hailed from [[Cornell University]] [http://ezra.cornell.edu/posting.php?timestamp=1097125200]. The school was established as a [[coeducation]]al institution although it maintained a cap on female enrollment for many years. This was not due to any anti-female sentiment but rather based on a concern of Jane Stanford, who worried that without such a cap, the school could become an all-girl institution, which she did not feel would be an appropriate memorial for her son.<br/>+<br/>+The official motto of Stanford University, selected by the Stanfords, is "''Die Luft der Freiheit weht.''" Translated from [[German language|German]], this quotation of [[Ulrich von Hutten]] means "The wind of freedom blows." At the time of the school's establishment, German had recently replaced [[Latin]] as the dominant language of science and philosophy (a position it would hold until [[World War II]]).<br/>+<br/>+==Campus==<br/>+[[Image:Stanford campus aerial photo.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Aerial photo of the Stanford campus]]<br/>+Stanford University owns 8,183 acres (32 km²). The main campus is bounded by [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]], Stanford Avenue, Junipero Serra Boulevard and [[Sand Hill Road]], in the northwest part of the [[Santa Clara Valley]] on the [[San Francisco Peninsula]].<br/>+In the summer of 1886, when the campus was first being planned, Stanford brought the president of [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[Francis Amasa Walker]], and prominent [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] landscape architect [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] westward for consultations. Olmsted worked out the general concept for the campus and its buildings, rejecting a hillside site in favor of the more practical flatlands. [[Charles Allerton Coolidge]] then developed this concept in the style of his late mentor, [[Henry Hobson Richardson]], in the [[Richardsonian Romanesque]] style, characterized by rectangular stone buildings linked by arcades of half-circle arches. The original campus was also designed in the Spanish-colonial style common to California known as [[Mission Revival]]. The red tile roofs and solid [[sandstone]] masonry hold a distinctly Californian appearance and most of the subsequently erected buildings have maintained consistent exteriors. The red tile roofs and bright blue skies common to the region are a famously complementary combination.<br/>+<br/>+Much of this first construction was destroyed by the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] but the University retains the Quad, the old Chemistry Building and Encina Hall (reportedly the residence of [[John Steinbeck]] during his time at Stanford). After the 1989 [[Loma Prieta earthquake]] inflicted further damage, the University implemented a billion-dollar capital improvement plan to retrofit and renovate older buildings for new, up-to-date uses.<br/>+<br/>+[[Image:Stanford-bikes.jpg|Due to the large size of the campus, [[bicycle]]s are a common sight|thumb|left|250px]]<br/>+The off-campus [[Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve]] is a nature reserve owned by the university and used by wildlife biologists for research. [[Hopkins Marine Station]], located in [[Pacific Grove, California]], is a [[marine biology]] research center owned by the university since 1892. The University also has its own golf course and a seasonal lake (Lagunita, actually an irrigation reservoir), both home to the endangered [[California Tiger Salamander]].<br/>+<br/>+Contemporary campus landmarks include the [[Stanford Main Quad|Main Quad]] and [[Stanford Memorial Church|Memorial Church]], the [[Iris & B.

[[Frank Lloyd Wright]]'s 1937 [[Hanna House]] and the [[1919]] [[Lou Henry and Herbert Hoover House]] are both [[National Historic Landmark]]s now on university grounds.<br/>+<br/>+The [[United States Postal Service]] has assigned two [[ZIP codes]] to Stanford: 94305 for campus mail in general and 94309 for student mail. Stanford lies within [[area code 650]] and campus phone numbers start with 723, 724, 725, 736, 497, or 498.<br/>+<br/>+==Institutions==<br/>+[[Image:Stanford_University_campus_from_above.jpg|thumb|right|500px|Quad and surrounding area]]<br/>+Stanford University is governed by a board of trustees, in conjunction with the university president, provosts, faculty senate, and the deans of the various schools. Besides the university, the Stanford trustees oversee [[Stanford Research Park]], the [[Stanford Shopping Center]], the [[Iris & B. Gerald Cantor Center for Visual Arts|Cantor Center for Visual Arts]], [[Stanford University Medical Center]] and many associated medical facilities (including the [[Lucile Packard Children's Hospital]]), as well as many acres of undeveloped foothills. <br/>+<br/>+Other Stanford-affiliated institutions include the [[Stanford Linear Accelerator|Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC)]] and the [[Stanford Research Institute]], a now-independent institution which originated at the University. <br/>+<br/>+Stanford also houses the [[Hoover Institution|Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace]], a major [[public policy]] [[think tank]] that attracts visiting scholars from around the world, and the [[Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies]], which is dedicated to the more specific study of [[international relations]].<br/>+<br/>+The Stanford University Libraries hold a collection of more than eight million volumes. The main library in the SU library system is [[Green Library]]. Meyer Library holds the vast East Asia collection and the student-accessible media resources. Other significant collections include the Lane Medical Library, Jackson Business Library, Falconer Biology Library, Cubberley Education Library, Branner Earth Sciences Library, Swain Chemistry and Chemical Engineering Library, Jonsson Government Documents collection, Crown Law Library, the Stanford Auxiliary Library (SAL), the SLAC Library, the Hoover library, the Miller Marine Biology Library at Hopkins Marine Station, the Music Library, and the University's special collections.

Several academic departments and some residences also have their own libraries.<br/>+<br/>+== Traditions ==<br/>+Stanford University student traditions include:<br/>+*Full Moon on the Quad: A student gathering in the Main Quad of the university. Traditionally, seniors exchange kisses with freshmen, although students of all four classes (as well as the occasional graduate student or stranger) have been known to participate.<br/>+*Sunday Flicks: Watching a film on Sunday night in [[Memorial Auditorium]]. Usually includes [[paper airplanes]]. <br/>+*Steam-tunnelling: Exploring the steam tunnels under the Stanford campus<br/>+*Fountain-hopping: Cavorting in any of Stanford's many fountains (such as the Claw in White Plaza)<br/>+*Having [[University of California, Berkeley]] as their arch-rival from across the San Francisco Bay.<br/>+*Big Game events: Including Big Game Gaieties (a student-written, composed, and produced musical), which is the week before and including the [[Big Game (football)|Big Game]] vs. UC Berkeley.<br/>+*[[Primal scream]]: Performed by stressed students at midnight during [[Dead week|Dead Week]]<br/>+*Midnight Breakfast: During dead week, Stanford faculty serves breakfast to students in several locations on campus (you might see a vice-provost refilling orange juice, etc.)<br/>+*Viennese Ball: a formal [[Ball (dance)|ball]] with [[waltzes]] which was started in the 1970s by students returning from the now closed Stanford in [[Vienna]] program.<ref>http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/2002/mayjun/features/vienneseball.html</ref><br/>+*The Stanford [[Powwow]]: Organized by the Stanford American Indian Organization and held every [[Mother's Day]] weekend.<ref>http://powwow.stanford.edu/</ref><br/>+*The [[Halloween]] party at the Stanford family [[mausoleum]], which has been on hiatus since 2001 due to the fear that the festivities would further deteriorate the conditions of the mausoleum, was revived in 2006.<br/>+*Senior Pub Night: On most Thursdays during the school year, seniors gather together at a bar in Palo Alto or San Francisco. The location rotates week to week, and chartered buses are organized to take the seniors safely between the bar and campus.<br/>+<br/>+Older, now inactive traditions include the Big Game bonfire on [[Lake Lagunita]] (a seasonal lake usually dry in the autumn).<br/>+<br clear="all"><br/>+<br/>+==Community==<br/>+Stanford has been [[coeducational]] since its founding; however, between approximately 1899 and 1933, there was a policy in place limiting female enrollment to 500 students and maintaining a ratio of three males for every one female student. As of 2005, undergraduate enrollment is split nearly evenly between the sexes, but male enrollees outnumber female enrollees about 2:1 at the graduate level.<br/>+<br/>+Stanford places a strong focus on residential education. Approximately 94 percent of undergraduate students live in on-campus university housing, with another five percent living in Stanford housing at the overseas campuses. According to the Stanford Housing Assignments Office, undergraduates live in 77 different houses, including dormitories, row houses, fraternities and sororities. Residences are located generally just outside the campus core, within ten minutes (on foot or bike) of most classrooms and libraries. Some residences are for freshmen only; others give priority to sophomores, others to both freshmen and sophomores; some are available for upperclass students only, and some are open to all four classes. All residences are coed except for seven all-male fraternities, three all-female sororities, and one all-female house. In most residences men and women live on the same floor, but a few dorms are configured for men and women to live on separate floors.<br/>+<br/>+Stanford is home to three housed sororities ([[Pi Beta Phi]], [[Kappa Alpha Theta]], and [[Delta Delta Delta]]) and seven housed fraternities ([[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]], [[Sigma Chi]], [[Kappa Sigma]], [[Kappa Alpha Order|Kappa Alpha]], [[Theta Delta Chi]], [[Sigma Nu]], [[Phi Kappa Psi]]), as well as a number of unhoused Greek organizations, such as [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]], [[Delta Tau Delta]] and [[Sigma Phi Epsilon]]. Several residences are considered theme houses, with either an ethnic or academic focus.<br/>+<br/>+At any time, around 50 percent of the graduate population lives on campus. When construction concludes on the new Munger graduate residence, this percentage will probably increase.<br/>+<br/>+==Academics==<br/>+[[Image:Stanford University Walkway Panorama.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Walkway near the Quad]]<br/>+The schools of the University include the [[Stanford University School of Humanities and Sciences|School of Humanities and Sciences]], [[Stanford University School of Engineering|School of Engineering]], [[Stanford University School of Earth Sciences|School of Earth Sciences]], [[Stanford University School of Education|School of Education]], [[Stanford Graduate School of Business|Graduate School of Business]], [[Stanford Law School]] and the [[Stanford University School of Medicine]].  <br/>+<br/>+Stanford awards the following degrees: [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]], [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]], [[Bachelor of Arts and Science|B.A.S.]], [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|M.A.]], [[Master of Science|M.S.]], [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]], [[D.M.A.]], [[Doctor of Education|Ed.D.]], [[Ed.S.]], [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]], [[Master of Business Administration|M.B.A.]], [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]], [[J.S.D.]], [[J.S.M.]], [[Master of Laws|LL.M.]], [[Master of Arts in Teaching|M.A.T.]], [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]], [[Master's degree#MLS, MLIS, MSIS, MSLS|M.L.S.]], [[M.L.A.]], and [[Engineer's degree|ENG]].<br/>+<br/>+The University enrolls approximately 6,700 undergraduates and 8,000 grad students. The University has approximately 1,700 faculty members, including 18 [[Nobel laureate]]s and 23 [[MacArthur fellows]].

The matter of whether Shakespeare did or did not attempt a play which conformed to the principles of unity aside, it is necessary to rewrite the section regarding unity of action, as it is a matter of contention whether it is precisely observed. Joseph Warton, for example in "Remarks on the Creation of Character" wrote that "The action is one, great, and entire, the restoration of Prospero to his dukedom" ("Remarks on the Creation of Character" in "The Tempest: A Casebook ed. D. J. Palmer p. 42 - 47) Although such an interpretation may be challenged, it is certainly true that Prospero is responsible for most of the action of the play, except, as Middleton Murry noted "There is but one accident in the Tempest, the accident which brings the ship to the island" ("Shakespeare's Dream" in "The Tempest: A Casebook ed. D. J. Palmer p. 109 - 119). I would be grateful if somebody could resolve this. [[User:Dondavidoff|Dondavidoff]] 18:55, 23 May 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+: Hello, does 'unity of action' ''have'' to mean one person causing everything? I thought it simply meant that there shouldn't be irrelevant subplots. Correct me if I'm wrong. By the way, you can sign and date your posts by typing four tildes (<nowiki>~~~~</nowiki>). [[User:The Singing Badger|The Singing Badger]] 16:50, 22 May 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+: Hey. You're right, unity of action does not mean it has to all be the cause of one person, but in the context of "The Tempest" this ensures it. All the subplots are created by Prospero's methodical scattering of the various shipwrecked characters where he wants them and with who he wishes, such as, for example, his allowing Ferdinand to be the first to meet Miranda. Because of this, it could be argued that there are NO subplots, and that is why there is an adherence to the unity of action. Oh, and thanks for the help with the tildes! [[User:Dondavidoff|Dondavidoff]] 15:22, 23 May 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+: OK cool, but I don't see why the accidental arrival of the ship at the island conflicts with this; it's ''related'' to the story of Prospero, so it doesn't break the unity of action. Right? [[User:The Singing Badger|The Singing Badger]] 20:11, 23 May 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+: Right. The article just needs to be changed to how the unity of action is adhered to. [[User:Dondavidoff|Dondavidoff]] 10:19, 24 May 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+The statement that 'The Tempest' is "the worst play of them all" is absolutely inappropriate to a junior high school essay on the play, let alone an encyclopedia article. Not only is it a statement of opinion, but it also ignores the fact that there are several other plays which are (arguably, of course) much more worthy of the 'honor.' I cannot claim to be a Shakespearean scholar, but I believe that such a sweepingly negative critique of this play would not be supported by the relevent literature, at least not so long as 'Timon of Athens' is still around, or whichever one it is where people are cooked and eaten.  --PurpleChez 20 July 2006</td>

During the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] in [[1894]], he went with the army to fight in [[Choson]]. After the war was over, he joined [[Yuan Shikai]] to participate in the training of [[New Army]] (Known as the [[Beiyang Army]]). Admired by Yuan, Cao managed to rise very quickly.<br/>+The '''Battle of Mohács''' ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: ''mohácsi csata'' or ''mohácsi vész'', [[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''Mohaç Savaşı'' or ''Mohaç Meydan Savaşı'') was fought on [[August 29]], [[1526]] between the [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] army led by [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis II]] and the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] army led by [[Suleiman the Magnificent]].<br/> <br/>-He was made a general in the [[Beiyang Army]] and led the [[Zhili]] clique after the death of [[Feng Guozhang]]. During the [[1918]] election, he was promised the vice-presidency by [[Duan Qirui]] but the office remained vacant after most of the [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]] left, depriving it of a [[quorum]].  He felt betrayed by Duan and defeated him in battle in [[1920]].  He forced the resignations of both [[Xu Shichang]] and [[Li Yuanhong]] and was [[president of the Republic of China]] (on [[Beijing]]) from [[October 10]], [[1923]] to [[November 2]], [[1924]].<br/>+==Preparations==<br/>+The Hungarians had long opposed Ottoman expansion in southeastern Europe. Unfortunately the fall of Belgrade (hung. Nándorfehérvár, lat. Alba Bulgarica) in 1521 meant that most of southern Hungary was now indefensible. As a counter to growing Ottoman power the Hungarian King [[Louis II of Hungary and Bohemia|Louis II]] entered into marriage with [[Maria of Austria]] in 1522 hoping to gain the aid of the [[Habsburgs]] in the looming war with the Ottomans. The Ottomans of course saw the growing alliance as a threat to their power in the Balkans and felt a need to break this alliance. <br/> <br/>-== "Bribing President" ==<br/>+In an effort to forestall a complete military offensive and possible occupation of Hungary the Porte offered the Hungarians at least one and possibly two peace offerings. It is unclear why exactly [[Louis II of Hungary and Bohemia|king Louis]] refused the peace offer from the Ottomans. It is possible that pressure from western Hungarian nobles, who were more heavily influenced by the proximity to growing Hapsburg power, worried about future Austrian aggression should Hungary conclude peace with the Ottomans. However a peace with the Ottoman Empire was not completely unheard of either as Poland had concluded a similar peace with the Porte a few years previous. Ultimately efforts at a peaceful resolution failed and the Ottomans had little choice and decided to use military power. To such ends in June 1526, an Ottoman expedition advanced up the [[Danube River|Danube]] to attack. <br/> <br/>-Cao Kun infamously acquired the presidential office by openly bribing assembly members with 5000 silver dollars each. This episode brought disrepute to the [[Beiyang government]] and its assembly, which lacked a quorum to even hold elections. It turned all the rival factions against him and his own clique began suffering from dissension. Relations with his chief protege, [[Wu Peifu]], soured and there was rumours of an impending split within the Zhili clique but they stayed together to fight against the [[Fengtian]] clique. <br/>+The Hungarian army was divided into three main units: The Transylvanian army with its battle task of guarding the passes in the Transylvanian Alps under [[John Zápolya|Janos Szapolyai]] number between 8,000 and 13,000 men, the main army led by [[Louis II of Hungary and Bohemia|Louis II]] himself and another smaller force, commanded by Croatian Count Christopher [[Frankopan]] numbering around 5,000 men. As a result of the Kingdom's geographical position the Turkish army's final goal could not be determined until it was crossing the Balkan Mountains. Unfortunately by the time the Ottoman's army crossed the Transylvanian army was further from Buda than the Ottomans were. Contemporary historical record though very sparse indicates that King Louis preferred a plan of retreat, in effec ceding the country to Ottoman advances, rather than directly engaging the Ottoman army in open battle.<br/> <br/>-One of his first acts as president was to promulgate the 1923 [[constitution]]. Hastily drafted by the guilt-ridden assembly, it was deemed the most democratic and progressive yet, but like previous charters it was ignored completely. <br/>+The Hungarian forces chose the battlefield, an open but uneven plain leading down to the Danube, with some swampy marshes. The Ottomans had been allowed to advance almost unopposed. While Louis waited in [[Buda]], they had besieged several towns and crossed the [[Sava (river)|Sava]] and the [[Drava]]. Louis II. had assembled around 26,000 to 40,000 soldiers and the Ottoman army was around 70,000 to 100,000 troops. The Hungarian army was arrayed to take advantage of the terrain and hoped to engage the Ottoman army piecemeal.<br/> <br/>-During a war against [[Zhang Zuolin]] in October 1924, Cao was betrayed and imprisoned by his General [[Feng Yuxiang]]. Feng occupied [[Beijing]] and forced Cao to resign. He was released two years later as a goodwill gesture by Feng to Wu Peifu.<br/>+==Battle==<br/>+As with the the debate over the number of actual combatants there is considerable debate over the length of the actual battle. The start of the battle is generally placed at somewhere between 1:00 and 2:00 in the afternoon the exact length of the battle is difficult to ascertain. While some historians have placed the length of the battle at 2 to 3 hours this seems unlikely given several important factors. First the Ottoman Army did not retreat from the field and enter camp after the battle, instead the Ottoman's remained on the field all night without food, water or shelter. Given that the Ottoman historians all note that it was raining. It seems likely that had the battle been short and ended early in the afternoon, by 5:00 at the latest, the Sultan would have ordered his army to camp or at least return to their baggage. Second the few reliable sources all indicate that Louis II left field at twilight and made his escape under some cover of darkness, the sun itself would not set until 6:30 on August 29, this would imply that the battle lasted significantly longer than 2 to 3 hours, perhaps as long as 4 or 5 hours. <br/> <br/>-Cao died in his home at [[Tianjin]] in May 1938. <br/>- <br/>-{{start box}}<br/>-{{succession box | before = [[Gao Lingwei]] | title = [[President of the Republic of China]]| years = 1923&ndash;1924 | after = [[Huang Fu]]}}<br/>-{{end box}}<br/>+As the first of Suleyman's troops, the [[Rumelia]]n army, advanced onto the battlefield they were attacked and routed by Hungarian troops led by [[Pál Tomori]]. This attack on the right was successful in causing considerable caos among the Ottoman ranks but even as the Hungarian attack pressed forward the Ottomans rallied with arrival of ever more Ottoman forces. While the Hungarian right advanced far enough att one time to place Suleyman in danger, from Hungarian arrows that struck his [[cuirass]] the superiority of the Ottoman numbers likely overwhelmed the attackers, particularly on the Hungarian left. Thus the Hungarians could not last and those who did not flee were surrounded and killed or captured. The king left the battlefield sometime around twighlight but was thrown from his horse in a river at Csele and died there, weighed down by his armor. Some 1,000 other Hungarian nobles and leaders were also killed. It is generally accepted that more than 10,000 Hungarian soldiers were killed in the initial battle and a similar number of Ottomans. <br/> <br/>+In the aftermath the Sultan, more expedient than chivalrous, gave orders to keep no prisoners.  Two days later he wrote in his diary "The Sultan receives the homage of the [[vizier]]s and the [[bey]]s, massacre of 2,000 prisoners, the rain falls in torrents." Reportedly among the 2,000 were several notable Hungarian leaders.<br/> <br/>-[[Category:1862 births]]<br/>-[[Category:1938 deaths]]<br/>-[[Category:Politicians of the Republic of China]]<br/>-[[Category:Warlords in Republican China]]<br/>+==Aftermath==<br/> <br/>-[[zh:曹錕]]<br/>+The victory did not give the Ottomans the security they wanted while the Ottomans captured Buda and pillaged the castle and surrondings they also quickly retreated. It was not until 1541 that the Ottomans finally captured Buda from the Hungarians after a short Austrian siege. For all intents and purposes the battle meant the end of the independent [[Kingdom of Hungary]], but the Ottoman forces withdrew in September and the territory was contested by the [[Habsburg]] [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand, Archduke of Austria]], Louis's brother-in-law and successor by treaty with king [[Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary|Uladislaus II]]. Austria dominated the western third of the country and portions of today's [[Croatia]], while the Ottomans obtained central Hungary and suzerainty over semi-independent [[Transylvania]], northern Hungary remained independent until the late 1500s. Worse for the Ottomans was the now near constant warfare that would require the commitment of Ottoman forces. Buda would be besieged seven times during the 1500s by Christian armies and Suliman himself would die during the siege of Szigetvar in 1566 and there were also two unsuccessful sieges of Eger (Eger would not fall until 1596 ending independent Hungarian resistance.) The numerous sieges and battles would consume large amounts of resources and time that Hungary as relatively poor Kingdom could not easily return to the Ottoman Empire. <br/>+<br/>+[[Image:Mohacs_Monument_at_the_Battlefield_2004.JPG|thumb|left|Battle Monument in Mohács]]<br/>+<br/>+Mohács is seen by many Hungarians as the decisive downward turning point in the country's history, one which would prove to become a national trauma.  To this day, Hungarians view Mohacs as the end of an independent and once powerful European nation. As if not to forget this calamity Hungarians still refer to this battle over 400 years ago to remind themselves how bad things could be. Similar to the English phrase of "don't cry over spilled milk," Hungarians state that "more was lost at Mohács" (Több is elveszett Mohácsnál) whenever they experience bad luck. While Mohacs was a decisive loss it was the aftermath that truly put an end to independent Hungary. The subsequent 200 years of near constant warfare between two Empires, Hapsburg and Ottoman, would decimate the Hungarian countryside and population.<br/>+<br/>+==Reference==<br/>+*[[Lord Kinross]], ''The Ottoman Centuries: The Rise and Fall of the Turkish Empire'' (1977) ISBN 0688080936<br/>+<br/>+[[Category:1526]]<br/>+[[Category:Battles of the Ottoman Empire|Mohács 1526]]<br/>+[[Category:Battles of Hungary|Mohács 1526]]<br/>+[[Category:Battles of the Hungarian-Ottoman Wars|Mohács 1526]]<br/>+<br/>+[[af:Slag van Mohács]]<br/>+[[ar:معركة موهاكس]]<br/>+[[cs:Bitva u Moháče]]<br/>+[[de:Schlacht bei Mohács (1526)]]<br/>+[[es:Batalla de Mohacs]]<br/>+[[it:Battaglia di Mohács]]<br/>+[[hu:Mohácsi csata]]<br/>+[[nl:Slag bij Mohács]]<br/>+[[ja:モハーチの戦い]]<br/>+[[no:Slaget ved Mohács (1526)]]<br/>+[[pl:Bitwa pod Mohaczem]]<br/>+[[pt:Batalha de Mohács]]<br/>+[[sk:Bitka pri Moháči]]</td>

It was adopted and standardized in 1947.<ref>Poyer, Joe. The AK-47 and AK-74 Kalashnikov Rifles and Their Variations (Paperback). North Cape Publications. 2004. pp1.<br/>+</ref><br/>+Compared with the auto-loading [[rifle]]s used in [[World War II]], the AK-47 was generally more compact, with a shorter range, a smaller [[7.62 x 39 mm|7.62 × 39 mm]] cartridge, and was capable of [[selective fire]]. It was one of the first true assault rifles and remains the most widely used. The AK-47 and its numerous variants and descendants have been produced in greater numbers than any other assault rifle and are in production to this day.<ref>Ibid.</ref><br/>+<br/>+==History==<br/>+===Design background===<br/>+During the [[Second World War]], [[Germany]] had developed the groundbreaking concept of the [[assault rifle]]. This concept was based on the knowledge that most military engagements in modern warfare were happening at fairly close range with the majority happening within 100  [[metre]]s (110&nbsp;[[yard|yd]]). The power and range of contemporary rifle cartridges was overly powerful for a vast majority of engagements with small arms. As a result, a cartridge and firearm were sought combining the features of a [[submachine gun]] (high-capacity magazine and fully-automatic fire capability) with an intermediate-power cartridge that would be effective to a range of 300 metres (330&nbsp;yd). For the sake of reduced manufacturing costs, this was done by shortening the [[7,92 x 57 mm|7.92 × 57 mm Mauser]] cartridge case to a length of 33 mm and substituting a lighter bullet to create the 7.92 x 33mm Kurz.<br/>+<br/>+The resulting [[Sturmgewehr 44]] (StG44) was not the first rifle to use these features; it was preceded by earlier [[Italian]], and [[Russian]] designs. The Germans were, however, the first to produce and field a sufficient number of the type to properly evaluate its utility. They fielded the weapon in large numbers against the Russians towards the end of the war. This experience deeply influenced Russian doctrine in the years following the war.<br/>+[[Image:Young kalashnikov.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Mikhail Kalashnikov in the late 1940s]]<br/>+<br/>+[[Mikhail Kalashnikov]] began imagining his weapon while still in the [[hospital]], after being wounded in the [[Battle of Bryansk]]. He had been informed that a new weapon was required for the [[7.62 × 41 mm cartridge]] developed by Elisarov and Semin in 1943. Sudayev's [[PPS43]] submachine gun was preferred to Kalashnikov's design. Kalashnikov revamped his losing design after examining a German StG44 in 1946. Kalashnikov was chosen to lead a team of designers possibly more for [[propaganda]] value due to his war-hero status rather than for his expertise. This would follow Soviet patterns in other industries.<br/>+<br/>+<br/>+<br/>+===Receiver development history===<br/>+[[Image:AK-47 and SKS DD-ST-85-01268.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Type 3 AK-47 (top), with its predecessor, the [[SKS]]]]<br/>+[[Image:AKMS and AK-47 DD-ST-85-01270.jpg|right|thumb|250px|AKS-47 on a Type 4B receiver (top), with a Type 2A]]<br/>+<br/>+There were many difficulties during the initial phase of production. The first production models had stamped sheet metal [[receiver (firearms)|receivers]]. Difficulties were encountered welding the guide and ejector rails causing high rejection rates.<ref>Poyer, 8</ref> Instead of halting production, a heavy machined receiver was substituted for the sheet metal receiver.<ref>Poyer, 9</ref> This was a more costly process, but the use of machined receivers accelerated production as tooling and labor for the earlier [[Mosin-Nagant]] rifle's machined receiver were easily adapted. Partly because of these problems, the Soviets were not able to distribute large numbers of the new rifle to soldiers until 1956. During this time, production of the interim [[SKS]] rifle continued.<ref>Poyer, 9</ref><br/>+<br/>+Once manufacturing difficulties had been overcome, a redesigned version designated the AKM (''M'' for ''modernized'' or ''upgraded''—in Russian: Автомат Калашникова Модернизированный) was introduced in 1959.<ref>Ezell, 36</ref> This new model used a stamped sheet metal receiver and featured a slanted [[muzzle brake]] on the end of the [[gun barrel|barrel]] to compensate for [[Muzzle (firearm)|muzzle]] rise under recoil. In addition, a hammer retarder was added in order to prevent the weapon from firing out of battery (without the bolt being fully closed) during rapid or automatic fire.<ref>Poyer, 11</ref> This is also sometimes referred to as a "cyclic rate reducer", or simply "rate reducer", as it also has the effect of reducing the number of rounds fired per minute during automatic fire. It was also lighter than the previous model, roughly two-thirds of the weight.<ref>Ezell, 36</ref> Both licensed and unlicensed production of the Kalashnikov weapons abroad were almost exclusively of the AKM, partially due to the much easier production of the stamped receiver. This model is the most commonly encountered, having been produced in much greater quantities. All rifles based on the Kalashnikov design are frequently referred to as AK-47s in the West, although this is only correct when applied to rifles based on the original 3 receiver types.<ref>Poyer, 2</ref> In most former Eastern Bloc countries, the weapon is known simply as the "Kalashnikov". The photo at right illustrates the differences between the Type 2 milled receiver and the Type 4 stamped, including the use of rivets rather than welds on the stamped receiver, as well as the placement of a small dimple above the magazine well for stabilization.<br/>+<br/>+In 1978, the Soviet Union began replacing their AK-47 and AKM rifles with a newer design, the [[AK-74]]. This new rifle and cartridge had only started being exported to eastern European nations when the Soviet Union collapsed, drastically slowing production of this and all other small arms.<br/>+<br/>+{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left" align="center" border="0" name=Receiver type classifications<br/>+!

Its ruggedness and reliability are legendary.<ref>http://www.strategypage.com/dls/articles/20030423.asp</ref><ref>http://kalashnikov.guns.ru/wwwboard/board4/messages/2114.html</ref><ref>http://www.booktrail.com/Video_Shooting/AKS,%20AK-47%20&%20MAK-90%20Type%20Armorer's%20Course.asp</ref> The large gas piston, generous clearances between moving parts, and tapered cartridge case design allow the gun to endure large amounts of foreign matter and fouling without failing to cycle. This reliability comes at the cost of accuracy, as the looser tolerances do not allow the precision and consistency that are required of more accurate firearms. Reflecting Soviet infantry doctrine of its time, the rifle is meant to be part of massed infantry fire, not long range engagements.<br/>+<br/>+The notched rear tangent iron sight is adjustable, each setting denoting hundreds of metres. The front sight is a post adjustable for elevation in the field. Windage adjustment is done by the armory prior to issue. The battle setting places the round within a few [[centimetre]]s above or below the point of aim out to approximately 250 metres (275&nbsp;yd). This "[[point-blank range]]" setting allows the shooter to fire the gun at any close target without adjusting the sights. Longer settings are intended for area suppression. These settings mirror the [[Mosin-Nagant]] and [[SKS]] rifles which the AK-47 replaced. This eased transition and simplified training.<br/>+<br/>+The [[caliber|bore]] and [[chamber]], as well as the gas piston and the interior of the [[gas cylinder]], are generally [[chromium]]-plated. This plating dramatically increases the life of these parts by resisting corrosion and wear. This is particularly important, as most military-production ammunition during the 20th century contained corrosive mercuric salts in the primers, which mandated frequent and thorough cleaning in order to prevent damage. Chrome plating of critical parts is now common on many modern military weapons.<ref>"Chrome-lined or non chrome-lined barrel?."

In this setting, the gun fires only once (semi-automatic), requiring the trigger to be released and depressed again for the next shot. With the selector in the middle position (full-automatic), the rifle continues to fire, automatically cycling fresh rounds into the chamber, until the magazine is exhausted or pressure is released from the trigger. As each bullet travels through the barrel, a portion of the gases expanding behind them are diverted into the gas tube above the barrel, where they impact the gas piston. This in turn is driven backward, pushing the bolt carrier, which causes the bolt to move backwards, ejecting the spent round, and chambering a new round when the recoil spring pushes it back.<ref>Department of the Army. Operators Manual for AK-47 Assault Rifle. 203d Military Intelligence Battalion</ref><br/>+<br/>+===Disassembly===<br/>+Dismantling the rifle involves the operator depressing the magazine catch and removing the magazine. The charging handle is pulled to the rear and the operator inspects the chamber to verify the gun is unloaded. The operator presses forward on the retainer button at the rear of the receiver cover while simultaneously lifting up on the rear of the cover to remove it. He then pushes the spring assembly forward and lifts it from its raceway, withdrawing it out of the bolt carrier and to the rear. The operator must then pull the carrier assembly all the way to the rear, lift it, and then pull it away. He removes the bolt by pushing it to the rear of the bolt carrier; rotating the bolt so the camming lug clears the raceway on the underside of the bolt carrier and then pulls it forward and free. When cleaning, the operator will pay special attention to the barrel, bolt face, and gas piston, then oil lightly and reassemble.<ref>Ibid</ref><br/>+<br/>+===Ballistics===<br/>+The standard AK-47 or AKM fires a [[7.62 x 39 mm|7.62 × 39 mm]] [[cartridge (weaponry)|round]] with a muzzle velocity of 710&nbsp;[[Metres per second|m/s]] (2,329&nbsp;[[Feet per second|ft/s]]). Muzzle energy is 1,990&nbsp;[[joule]]s (1,467&nbsp;[[Foot-pound force|ft·lbf]]). Cartridge case length is 38.6&nbsp;millimetres (1.5&nbsp;[[Inch|in]]), weight is 18.21&nbsp;[[gram]]s. Projectile weight is normally 8&nbsp;grams (123&nbsp;[[Grain (measure)|gr]]). The AK-47 and AKM, with the 7.62 × 39 mm cartridge, have a maximum effective range of around 300 metres (330&nbsp;yd). For comparison, the [[7.62 x 54 mm R|7.62 × 54 mm R]] cartridge has a projectile of 9.6–12&nbsp;grams (148–185&nbsp;gr), depending on the weapon, at a velocity of 818&nbsp;m/s (2,683&nbsp;ft/s) for approximately 4,000&nbsp;joules (2,950&nbsp;ft·lbf) of energy.{{fact}}<br/>+<br/>+==Legal status==<br/>+===In the United States===<br/>+[[Image:Misccaparms.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Arms captured in [[Fallujah]] by [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]], including two AKMs (first and third rifles from the left)]]<br/>+<br/>+Private ownership of fully-automatic AK-47 rifles is regulated by the [[National Firearms Act]] (NFA) of 1934. The [[Gun Control Act of 1968]] ceased importing of foreign-manufactured fully-automatic firearms for civilian sales and possession, effectively halting further importation of civilian accessible AK-47 rifles. In 1986, an amendment to the [[Firearm Owners Protection Act]] stopped all future domestic manufacture of fully-automatic weapons for civilian use. Generally, citizens who have not been convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor of domestic violence and who have never been involuntarily committed to a psychiatric facility can legally own a fully automatic weapon after completing some paperwork.<br/>+<br/>+Machine guns manufactured domestically prior to 1986 and imported prior to 1968 may be transferred between civilians in accordance with federal and state law. Several Soviet and [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] rifles made it into the U.S. during the mid-1960s, when returning [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] veterans brought them home after capture from enemy troops. Many of these were properly registered during the 1968 NFA amnesty. However, several states have laws on their books outlawing private possession of fully-automatic firearms even with NFA approval.<br/>+<br/>+Certain [[Semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic]] AK-47 models were banned by the now-expired [[Federal assault weapons ban|Assault Weapons Ban]] of 1994–2004.  Those "pre-ban" rifles were never made illegal for sale and post-ban rifles that complied with the ban continued to be sold during those years.  Now all forms of semi-automatic (one bullet per trigger pull but automatic re-loading of the chamber) assault rifles that were legal before 1994 are once again legal to produce, sell, and own.  <br/>+<br/>+Currently, the only federal law regulating the assembly or possession of semi-automatic AK-47–type weapons in the United States is 18 USC 922r. Commonly known as "922r", this section prohibits the domestic assembly of any firearm which would be ineligible for importation. The effect of this is that no more than 10 of the parts from the following list may be imported (manufactured outside the U.S.):<br/>+[[Image:Iraqwarimage.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Iraqi]] soldier, shown holding an AKM]]<br/>+# [[Receiver (firearms)|Receiver]]<br/>+# [[Gun barrel|barrel]]<br/>+# [[Trunnion]]<br/>+# Muzzle attachments ([[flash suppressor]]s, [[muzzle brake|brakes]], barrel extensions, barrel nuts)<br/>+# [[Bolt (firearm)|Bolt]]<br/>+# Bolt carrier<br/>+# Gas piston<br/>+# [[Trigger (mechanism)|Trigger]]<br/>+# Hammer (firearm)<br/>+# Disconnector<br/>+# [[Stock (firearm)|Buttstock]]<br/>+# [[Pistol grip]]<br/>+# [[Forearm (firearm component)|Forearm]]/hand guard<br/>+# [[Magazine (firearm)|Magazine]] body<br/>+# Magazine follower<br/>+# Magazine floorplate<br/>+<br/>+===In Canada===<br/>+In [[Canada]], the AK-47 and variants are illegal for purchase, acquisition, or import, the sole exceptions being the Valmet Hunter, the Valmet Hunter Auto and the Valmet M78 rifles which are based on the AK-47 action.<ref>"List of Restricted and Prohibited Firearms."

The federal fire arms and explosives law prohibits the civilian possesion of this category of weapon in its Article 11.<ref>LEY FEDERAL DE ARMAS DE FUEGO Y EXPLOSIVOS Article 11 http://info4.juridicas.unam.mx/ijure/fed/106/13.htm?s=</ref>.

The [[United Kingdom]], for instance, has outlawed, through the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988, semi-automatic centerfire rifles (See [[Gun politics in the United Kingdom]] for more complete information). It is possible to own AK derivatives in the UK provided they have been produced as "Manual Straight Pull" rifles which need to be manually cocked after each shot. This involves a modification to the weapon to essentially remove the gas system by permanently closing the gas port above the barrel (may also involve the removal of the gas piston).<br/>+<br/>+In [[Norway]] it is forbidden<ref>{{no icon}}[http://www.lovdata.no/for/sf/jd/td-19630125-9722-004.html#2-8 Forskrift om skytevåpen, våpendeler og ammunisjon, section 2-8]</ref> for civilians to possess any form of fully automatic firearm unless a special permit is issued. Similar laws are in force throughout most of Europe. Fully automatic weapons are either explicitly or effectively outlawed in almost all of North America and Europe, as well as Russia, Japan, and [[Gun politics in Australia|Australia]].<br/>+<br/>+===Illicit trade===<br/>+Throughout the world, the AK-47 and variants are among the plethora of commonly smuggled small arms that are sold to governments, rebels, criminals and civilians alike, with little international oversight.  This trade ensures a ready supply of inexpensive weapons to a number of conflicts, including (but certainly not limited to) the [[Balkans]], [[Iraq]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Somalia]]. In some countries that are recovering from war or that are at war, prices for AKs are very low. In Somalia, [[Rwanda]], [[Mozambique]], [[Congo]] and  [[Ethiopia]], among others, prices are between $30–$125.<ref>"The AK-47: The World's Favourite Killing Machine." ControlArms Briefing Note.

This period saw the proliferation, sometimes free of charge, of AK-47s by the Soviet Union and China to pro-communist countries and groups such as the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Nicaraguan Sandinistas]] and [[National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam|Việt Cộng]]. The AK-47 design was spread to a total of 55 national armies.<ref>Gorshkov, Nikolai.</ref><br/>+<br/>+The proliferation of this weapon is reflected by more than just numbers. The AK-47 is included in the [[flag of Mozambique|flag]] of [[Mozambique]] and its [[Coat of arms of Mozambique|coat of arms]] (formerly also in [[Burkina Faso]] [[Coat of arms of Burkina Faso|coat of arms]]) and the [[Hezbollah]] flag. "Kalash", a shortened form of "Kalashnikov", is used as a name for boys in some African countries.<br/>+<br/>+In the U.S., movie makers often depict criminals, gang members and terrorist characters being armed with AK-47s (e.g. films like ''[[Boyz N The Hood]]'').

For all practical purposes given the recent recomendations for FDA approval with severe restrictions and the fact that the FDA has delayed approval, it is not "settled".      <br/>-<br/>-What doctors have you been talking to?   Plastic Surgeons?   Even some of them know the dangers of silicone rupture -- especially the ones that remove implants and see the shape many of them are in.  My implants were grossly  ruptured and yellow.  My dear friend's silicone implants were black with fungus and mold.  That happens with saline implants, too, that have a faulty valve.<br/>-As the weeks wore on before my 'explant', I grew sicker and sicker, until I was having hives that went into anaphlactic shock.  I have been diagnosed with lupus, MS, Hashimoto's thyroiditis and fibromyalgia.   I could not walk across my living room before my explant.  Now I am walking and able to work part time.  I know that my ruptured silicone implants nearly killed me.<br/>-<br/>-I spoke to an epidemiologist the other day about this, who is very concerned about the inadequate tests submitted to the FDA by Mentor and Inamed on rupture rates.  Many epidemiologists ARE concerned.  More and more doctors are concerned.   This may not be true in your profession (let me guess, plastic surgery).  EVEN THE FDA SAYS IT IS UNSETTLED.  Are you going to call the FDA not 'mainstream'?   This issue is far from settled.<br/>-<br/>-"The overwhelming data clearly supports the efficacy and safety of these devices and they have recieved more scrutiny then any other device ever presented to the FDA.

You and your buddies need to change your sentences once in awhile. <br/>-The FDA stated that only ONE study had been done - in 50 years  or more - on the effects of rupture.   That tells me the studies that were previously done were problematic.  Indeed, the FDA pointed out some of the problems with earlier studies.  In fact, my neurologist, who received his MD at Northwestern Univ. and did his residency at Mayo, told me about the gross problems with the Mayo study.  He also pointed out how heavily funded it was by the manufacturers.  He does not believe the results of those earlier studies, because of their now infamous shortcomings.    These are the studies unscrupulous PS hype to 'prove' their point.  I<br/>-<br/>-The Dow settlement was NOT American class-action lawsuit abuse  101.   Asbestos is not the same as silicosis, by the way, in case you didn't know.  So before you go mixing all tort actions you need to find out what the hell you are talking about.  You probably think asbestos is safe, too, I bet.   I'm sure this was discussed in the WSJ editorial and right-wing think tanks.  According to some, all lawyers are bad and all litigation is bad.   Without litigation, more people would be dying from asbestos.  <br/>-<br/>-Your tone that you try to highlight the entire article is biased towards the safety of implants, when in fact, this has not been determined.  God knows it should have been, in the decades there could have been accurate, independent studies.  Sadly, many of the studies were like the tobacco research institute studies -- all guaranteed to show that smoking is not dangerous.

Medical pictures absolutely do not accomplish this goal.  --[[User:Noitall|Noitall]] 14:42, August 24, 2005 (UTC)<br/>-:May I ask where you got the pic from and by which nature it is under "fairuse"? --[[User:K.Nevelsteen|Kim Nevelsteen]] 15:19, 24 August 2005 (UTC)<br/>-Also, if the article or caption stated something to that effect there would be some kind of motive for it being here.

Jordan is not necessarily ''the'' most notable, but she is up there.  Arguably [[Pamela Anderson]] might be higher.  They have both discussed them, and Jordan was booted of the Page 3 because of them. --[[User:Noitall|Noitall]] 21:08, August 24, 2005 (UTC)<br/>-:But you still don't specify a source and that is a problem.--[[User:K.Nevelsteen|Kim Nevelsteen]] 01:24, 25 August 2005 (UTC)<br/>-::It is only a problem since I met you half way and agreed to your caption, but your real purpose is to delete.  You know, agreement and niceties just do not work when people have a one-track mind.  Your assertion as to copyrights is incorrect. Further, this is not the page for discussion nor is it proper procedure.  This page is a breast implant page. --[[User:Noitall|Noitall]] 01:41, August 25, 2005 (UTC)<br/>-:No, actually I am rather impartial since you agreed to the caption change. I think the image works. But when you make a statement, "''...of why hundreds of thousands of women pay many thousands of dollars and undergo a month or more of pain to achieve.  The most notable celebrity who received them is Jordan...''", then I would expect a source. most notable by whom? Who says it is the reason why, maybe women are a rare sort of breed and just like the pain. A source would clarify these things. --[[User:K.Nevelsteen|Kim Nevelsteen]] 01:47, 25 August 2005 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-::On notability, I was not trying to insert an edit to make that assertion, because the most notable would be a matter for debate, probably with Google searches or pics in mags or something. It is also somewhat irrelant as long is the subject is quite notable, it is not necessary to be the most notable.  Your question deals with psychology of breast implants, which is where we started in a round about way.  I suppose more could be written in the article about it, dealing with self image, the low fat fitness phenomenon, celebrities, the right proportions and what not, advertising, push-up bras, etc.  It seems like a big job. --[[User:Noitall|Noitall]] 01:59, August 25, 2005 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-:Indeed maybe a start of a new section.--[[User:K.Nevelsteen|Kim Nevelsteen]] 02:06, 25 August 2005 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-== about Breast Implants or Breast Implants available in the US? ==<br/>-<br/>-Is this article about Breast Implants or Breast Implants available in the US?

Unfortunately, the link is broken. Is this really correct? Since there are about 2,000,000 women per year, and I assume implants are done once in a lifetime, this would mean 12% of all women underwent augmentation. Seems a lot to me, given that it's controversial. [[User:Common Man|Common Man]] 15:57, 27 December 2005 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-Implants are NOT done once in a lifetime.  Implants do not last a lifetime.  Furthermore, there are often complications.  I have known women who have had 3, 4, even 7 or 8 surgeries.  It is also possible those figures are as accurate as the old 'studies' supporting the safety of silicone breast implants.  MB<br/>-<br/>-==famous breast 'implantees'==<br/>-<br/>-instead of the removed 'list of celebrities with breast implants', how about a section in this article on celebrities who are in some way linked with breast implants; i.e. they are famous for having them.

Lately, the more important factors appear to be the declining investment earnings of insurance companies and the changing nature of competition in the industry.<br/>-The recent spike in premiums - which is now showing signs of steadying - says more about the insurance business than it does about the judicial system.<br/>-<br/>-"You get these jolts in insurance prices periodically, and they attract a lot of attention," said Frank A. Sloan, a Duke University economist who has been following medical malpractice trends for nearly 20 years. "They're a result of a confluence of many things."<br/>-Data compiled by both the federal government and by insurance organizations show costs for the insurance companies climbing steadily over the last decade at an average annual rate of about 3 percent, after adjusting for inflation. Over most of that period, premiums for doctors rose modestly and sometimes even dropped as the insurance companies battled for market share in a scramble to collect more money to invest in strong bond and stock markets. <I>But when the markets turned sour and the reserves of insurers shriveled, companies began to double and triple the costs for doctors. </I> (emphasis added)</blockquote><br/>-<br/>-If you look at the handy dandy chart with the NY Times article, what you see is premiums increased dramatically in the mid-80s, flattened, and then went up again starting around 2000. <br/>-<br/>-As I recall, the commercial real estate industry tanked in the mid to late 80’s as did the real estate market as a whole by 1990. I also recall a stock market crash on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Monday_(1987) October 19, 1987] .

I understand the motivations of both. With the insurance industry its just plain old capitalism to do what  you can to increase profits and reduce losses regardless of the veracity of the insurance companies assertions. And nobody likes to be sued, so I understand the doctors' misguided motivation to believe what the insurance industry tells them.<br/>-<br/>-== IOM v. the 2001 Study ==<br/>-<br/>-It does not appear that the plastic surgeon disputes the fact the FDA said the 2001 study is the <b>only</B> study on long term effect of rupture.

The doctor is basically correct that the two are not equivalent, but not for the reasons the doctor suggests. <br/>-<br/>-Since the 2001 study is the <b>only</B> study on long term effect of rupture, then by definition the IOM study <b>cannot</B> be compared to it.  Apples to apples, oranges to oranges, not apples to oranges. <br/>-<br/>-BTW I was not aware that being a plastic surgeon was the same as being a specialist in disease or causation of disease. I would have thought the two were separate fields of study and that an expert in one was not necessarily an expert in the other.

That explains why you have edited this prolifically, to demonize lawyers and praise breast implants.  The adjunct study is most interesting to me, since I have talked to many women who participated -- or were supposed to have participated.  Reports of plastic surgeons dismissing women's complaints of joint pain, or other possible systemic illness are rampant.  One woman told me, "My surgeon just told me that silicone implants don't cause these problems, so he would not report it."   I wonder how often this has occurred.   Other women stated that they never received paperwork for the study.   I am compiling a list of how often this occurred.  To date, it seems all too frequent.<br/>-<br/>-I must say that you are correct when you suggest that I am suspicious of doctors.  I am particularly suspicious of plastic surgeons who benefit financially by the approval of silicone implants.  I have about as much respect for most plastic surgeons as you evidently have for attorneys.  <br/>-<br/>-The FDA stated that the 2001 study was the only study that addressed the long term effects of rupture.  That is significant, regardless of how many studies existed prior to this.  Morever, some of the studies the IOM used have been attacked for various reasons -- like the Mayo Clinic was a defendant in a related lawsuit at the time of the study.  The neuologist who pointed that out to me did his neurological residency at Mayo.  It seems he was correct.   Other concerns include removing women who explanted from the study.   <br/>-Furthermore, as you yourself point out, migration of silicone is a concern.<br/>-<br/>-I am thankful you left off the attorney-bashing.   I am sure you relish the idea of tort reform.   I believe that people should have access to the courts, and when harmed, should have a recourse commensurate with their injury.  Furthermore, our tort system does NOT encourage graft & fraud.   The federal rules of civil procedure contains a provision for sanction of not just lawyers but law firms for filing a frivolous lawsuit.  My guess, however, is that you think most, if not all, lawsuits are frivolous.  That is a philosophy, not a reality.<br/>-<br/>-I believe time will 'vindicate' the women who have been harmed by silicone implants.   I hope to God there will be some further independent studies in the effects of migrating silicone.   I have absolutely no doubt that ruptured silicone implants harmed me.  You may call me an 'anecdote' as those in your profession enjoy doing, but I know my body and know what happened.  My health was going downhill at breakneck speed before explant.  After explant, it has improved.  I am not suggesting that policy be guided by anecdotes.

What "many would call" is a variation on the "some people say" which is a straw man argument hear often in the news of late.  Who are these many?  The society of plastic surgeons and implant manufacturers?   In contrast, many women can tell you that they were subjected to abuse by the manufacturers in this process.  The Daubert rule was used by manufacturers to disqualify experts I believe should not have been disqualified.  Many of these had bona fide scientific qualifications but their opinion deviated from the 'mainstream'.   But that is an entirely different debate.   <p><br/>-:::Furthermore, the DOW settlement was not a med-mal case.  It was a products liability case.   But on the subject that I know is dear to your heart - med mal -- we disagree here too.<br/>-Litigating a med mal case is very expensive.  Most lawyers won't want to touch one unless they feel it has merit.   In many states, a doctor must certify the case is not frivolous.  Further, there are federal (and state) rules of civil procedure to sanction lawyers and law firms for bringing frivolous cases.  Someone below addressed the issue of med mal insurance.   The number of legitimate cases of medical malpractice has been well publicized in recent years.  I have seen more than a few examples of that.  And as I said before, if "many" doctors would worry half as much about their patients as they do litigation, there would be far fewer med mal cases. <p><br/>-<br/>-::First of all, please add comments in an orderly manner, with section breaks, indented responses, signatures (simply type four tildes <nowiki>~~~~</nowiki>) and common conventions of the like.  As for povs, notable criticisms and controversies need to be accorded reasonable inclusion, as mandated by npov [[prescription]]s.  Simply whitewashing an article of contrarian content is just as objectionable, and contrary to the spirit of npov, as any alleged hijacking of an article by dissenters from mainstream pov.  That said, covering alternative perspectives on medical articles is essential and necessary, as majority opinion is often dead wrong, e.g., [[Galileo affair|Galileo]].  Given that breast augmentation literally has so much to do with aesthetic and cosmetic appearances, this particular article is somewhat symbolic of the politically correct posturing that has grossly undermined scientific analysis of an increasing number of medical issues.  Typically, medical articles within the Wiki tend to attract a great deal of attention from editors anxious to delete content that questions the authoritative views of high ranking figures in the medical field.  To a point, that is all well and good, as give and take can and should be considered an indicator of a robust debate.  On the other hand, there are many examples of medical articles, hijacked by deletionists, that can only be described as beset by arrested development, due to heavy handed attempts to marginalize legitimate concerns about clear and present dangers denied or ignored by the defenders of medical orthodoxy.  As organizations grow, the spam of orthodox [[disinformation]], in a process related to [[stovepiping]] (''retrieval of information from unconnected databases; the situation that exists when it is necessary to climb out of one database in order to climb down into another; sometimes used for protection against wandering hackers'' [http://www.wordreference.com/definition/stovepiping]), tends to drown out reasonable expressions of concern.  The phenomenon has also been observed among other primates.[http://www.yubanet.com/artman/publish/printer_33209.shtml]  The Wiki's npov guidelines seem to be designed deliberately to avoid this problem, and should serve to ensure that the overall gaze of articles is not limited to simplistic [[expert worship]].

You misrepresented that study.<br/>-<br/>-:The mainstream viewpoint is heavily burdened, and thus quite dubious, due to often obscene [[conflict of interest]] problems in the medical field, problems that have escalated in direct relation to the growing disparities in wealth and political clout between corporations and mere carbon based life forms.  Silicon is hardly conducive to the well being of the latter; pharmaceutical and medical corporations have demonstrated over and over again that their collective immune response --to anything or anyone that might question the often unscrupulous practices leading to the corpulence of their bottom lines-- is profoundly dysfunctional.  The fact is, science has taken a back seat to the abusive [[character assassination]]s and other cosmetic marketing ploys of many sectors of the medical industry.  If you want to trot out painted ladies and choir boys to drown the article in accord with the marketing paradigm that has transformed many medical journals into pimping parodies strewn with little more than propaganda, then the marginalization of an apparently concerned and dedicated [[whistleblower]] would make some sense.  Otherwise, it would be best to ascertain the credibility of such critics and present a factual account of such concerns in a manner that will allow readers to make a well informed decision about which is more credible.  Given that most medical professionals are now specialists, apparently because they are attracted to the greater monetary rewards that go along with specialization, they tend not to understand much about [[systems biology]], much less immune systems (which, surprise, surprise, don't seem too fond of copious amounts of silicon leaking from foreign objects).  To tell the truth, dissenting opinions rarely attain high status in rigidly hierarchical corporate cultures like the medical industry, so the argument that this particular whistleblower is not widely recognized basically goes without saying, and is a moot point, but the issue of [[rankism]] can be discussed elsewhere.  What is important here are the widespread reports of adverse immune responses, which the [[chronic fatigue syndrome]], [[autism epidemic]], and [[Gulf War syndrome]] controversies have already demonstrated to be poorly understood by most medical professionals.  This is most likely the case with cosmetic surgery specialists as well.  So, please don't shoot the messenger, in keeping with the spirit of NPOV.  Surely, there are plenty of other messengers, addressing issues like how [[fibromyalgia]] is virtually certain to result from silicon leakage, if this one is seriously lacking in credibility.

Cover art by [[Joe Shuster]].]]<br/>+'''''Action Comics''''' is the [[comic book]] series that [[first appearance|introduced]] [[Superman]], the first major [[superhero]] character as the term is popularly defined.  The publisher was originally known as [[Detective Comics]], Inc., and later as National Comics and as [[National Periodical Publications]], before taking on its current name of [[DC Comics]], a subsidiary of [[Time Warner]].<br/> <br/>+==Publication History==<br/>+===Superman===<br/>+[[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]] saw their creation, Superman, launched in ''Action Comics'' #1 in June 1938.  Siegel and Shuster had tried for years to find a publisher for their Superman character (originally conceived as a newspaper strip) without success.  The writer and artist had worked on several features for National Periodical Publications' other titles ([[Slam Bradley]] in [[Detective Comics]], for example) and were asked to contribute a feature for National's newest publication.  They submitted Superman for consideration, and after re-pasting the sample newspaper strips they had prepared into comic book page format, National decided to make Superman the cover feature of their new magazine.  The dynamic "Man of Tomorrow" was an instant hit, and he permanently changed the medium of [[comic books]] and [[comic strip]]s by formalizing a new fantasy subgenre. ''Action Comics'' was soon followed by the ''Superman'' comic book series in 1939, along with a wealth of other comics starring numerous costumed superheroes.<br/> <br/>+As of 2006, ''Action Comics'' is still in publication, surpassing 800 issues. This makes it the second-highest-number American comic book series, after [[Dell Comics]]' ''[[Four Color]]''.<br/> <br/>-== New discussion ==<br/>-dzsfgdfghazdbh<br/>-[[User:59.162.116.140|59.162.116.140]] 09:07, 14 November 2006 (UTC)<br/>+===Hiatus===<br/>+[[Image:Action Comics 800.jpg|thumb|left|Cover of ''Action Comics'' #800. Art by [[Drew Struzan]].]] ''Action Comics'' is the second-longest running [[DC Comics]] series after ''[[Detective Comics]]''; however, it cannot claim to have had an uninterrupted run, as it went on hiatus for three months twice, once in 1986 (when the regular Superman books were suspended during the publication of  [[John Byrne|John Byrne's]] ''[[The Man of Steel (comic book)|The Man of Steel]]'' six-issue [[limited series]], and again in 1992 (when the Superman books went on a 3-month hiatus following the "[[Death of Superman]]" and "Funeral for a Friend" stories). In 1988, DC Comics tried unsuccessfully to return the format of the comic to an anthology and publish it on a weekly basis, but it returned to a monthly format less than a year later. (However, the temporarily increased frequency of issues allowed ''Action'' to surpass the older ''Detective Comics'' in the number of individual issues published.)  Another departure from a strict monthly schedule were the giant-size [[Supergirl]] reprint issues of the 1960s and very early 1970s (published as a 13th issue annually).<br/>+<br/>+===Early Anthology===<br/>+Originally, ''Action Comics'' was an anthology title featuring a number of other stories in addition to the Superman story.  [[Zatara]], a magician, was one of the other characters who had their own stories in early issues.  ([[Zatanna]], a heroine introduced in the 1960s, is Zatara's daughter.)  There was also the hero Tex Thompson, who eventually became Mr. America and later the [[Americommando]]. [[Vigilante (comics)|Vigilante]] also enjoyed a lengthy run in this series.  Sometimes stories of a more humorous nature were included, such as those of [[Hayfoot Henry]], a policeman who talked in rhyme.  Gradually the size of the issues was decreased as the publisher was reluctant to raise the cover price from the original 10 cents, so there were fewer stories.  For a while, [[Congo Bill]] and [[Tommy Tomorrow]] were the two features in addition to Superman (Congo Bill eventually gained the ability to swap bodies with a gorilla and his strip was renamed [[Congorilla]]), but soon after the introduction of [[Supergirl]] in issue #252 (May 1959) the non-Superman-related strips were crowded out of ''Action'' altogether.  Since then, it has generally been an all-Superman comic, though other backup stories, such as [[The Human Target]] occasionally appear.<br/>+<br/>+===''Action Comics Weekly''===<br/>+For a bit less than a year in 1988-1989, the publication frequency was changed to weekly and the title became ''Action Comics Weekly''; this change lasted from issue #601 to issue #642. During this time, Superman appeared only in a two page story per issue; however, he was still the only character to appear in every issue of the run.<br/>+<br/>+To boost the profile of ''Action Comics Weekly'', prior to its launch DC cancelled its ongoing [[Green Lantern]] title ''Green Lantern Corps'' and made Green Lantern and his adventures exclusive to ''Action Comics Weekly''. The move was largely a failure, as many fans felt the ''Action Comics Weekly'' stories were of extremely poor quality. Green Lantern was soon moved out of the title and relaunched with a new series in 1989. <br/>+<br/>+The rest of these issues featured rotating serialized stories of other, mostly minor, DC heroes, as try-outs that led to their own limited series. Characters with featured stories in the run included [[Black Canary]], [[Blackhawk (comics)|Blackhawk]], [[Catwoman]], [[Deadman]], [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]], [[Phantom Lady]] (Dee Tyler), [[Phantom Stranger]], [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]], [[Speedy (comics)|Speedy]], and [[Wild Dog (comic)|Wild Dog]].<br/>+<br/>+==Collections==<br/>+<br/>+* '''''Superman Chronicles vol 1''''' reprints issues #1 - 13.<br/>+* '''''Superman in the Forties''''' reprints issues #1, 2, 14, 23, 64, 93 & 151.<br/>+* '''''Superman in Action Comics Archives'''''<br/>+** '''''Volume 3''''' reprints issues #37 - 53.<br/>+** '''''Volume 4''''' reprints issues #54 - 68.<br/>+<br/>+==Awards==<br/>+''Action Comics'' #687 through 689 were part of ''[[The Death of Superman|The Reign of the Supermen]]'' storyline, which won the 1993 ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'' Fan Award for Favorite Comic Book Story that year.<br/>+<br/>+==References==<br/>+* The cover of ''Action Comics #1'' is one of the most referenced comic covers, including:<br/>+**appearing in two consecutive episodes of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' when Krusty the Clown sets it on fire to light a cigar, and when Homer finds it at a swap meet for 5 cents and dismisses it as "junk"<br/>+**The cover of ''Action Comics #1'' is enacted by [[Kal-L]] in ''[[Infinite Crisis]] #5'' in the setting of [[Multiverse_(DC_Comics)#Catalogued_Earths|Earth-Two]], the [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]] [[DC Universe]].<br/>+**A reenactment of the cover also appears in '''''[[Kingdom Come (comic)|Kingdom Come]]'''''<br/>+**The 2006 film ''[[Superman Returns]]'' also references the cover of issue 1 in two scenes.<br/>+**It is re-encacted in a full page spread in the [[Elseworlds]] ''[[Frankenstein]]'' pastiche ''The Superman-Monster'' in which the Monster lifts Eloise Edge's carriage when the horses bolt.<br/>+**The cover of ''Superman'' #136 shows the Superman of 2999 AD lifting a [[hovercar]].<br/>+**The cover of ''Amazing [[Spider-Man]]'' #306 shows ''[[Spider-Man]]'' hoisting a police car in the same manner as ''[[Superman]]'' on the cover of ''Action Comics #1''.<br/>+<br/>+==External links==<br/>+*[http://www.dccomics.com/ DC Comics official site]<br/>+*[http://www.english.ufl.edu/imagetext/archives/exhibit1/action.shtml Online exhibit of selected ''Action Comics'' from the University of Florida collection]<br/>+*[http://www.squidoo.com/actioncomics/ Superman in Action Comics Issue One June 1938]<br/>+*[http://www.comic-covers.com/DC/DCA-B/Action/index.html Action Comics cover gallery]<br/>+*[http://supermandatabase.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=4ndvddb&field=&author=&f_comic=&file=search&SearchComics=yes&title=Action%Comics&story=&image_stat=&limit=10&plot=&story_arc=&cover_tagline=&special_notes=&editors=&pencillers=&inkers=&cover_artists=&characters=&publish_start=&publish_stop=&op=modload&file=search&name=4ndvddb&image_stat=&sort_by=&dir_page=1&limit=100 The Superman Database] - List of every issue of “Action Comics” ever published.

Profiles also contain a [[blog]] with standard fields for content, emotion, and media. MySpace also supports uploading images. One of the images can be chosen to be the "[[Userpic|default image]]," the image that will be seen on the profile's main page, search page, and as the image that will appear to the side of the user's name on comments, messages, etc. MySpace has also added the option to upload videos via the MySpace Videos service, that are played via a standalone Flash player.<br/>-<br/>-===Friend Space===<br/>-The User's Friends Space contains a count of a user's friends, a "Top Friends" area, and a link to view all of the user's friends. Users can choose a certain number of friends to be displayed on their profile in the "Top Friends" area. The "Top Friends" used to be restricted to eight friends. People bypassed this limitation by using third-party tools to emulate a "Top X" friends. Currently, MySpace allows 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, or 24 friends to be displayed in the "Top Friends" area.<br/>-<br/>-===Comments===<br/>-Below the User's Friends Space (by default) is the "comments" section, wherein the user's friends may leave comments for all viewers to read. MySpace users have the option to delete any comment and/or require all comments to be approved before posting. If a user's account is deleted, every comment left on other profiles by that user will be deleted.<br/>-<br/>-===Profile customization===<br/>-{{wikinews|MySpace to take on iTunes}}<br/>-MySpace allows users to modify their user pages. Although [[JavaScript]] is not allowed, [[Hypertext markup language|HTML]]/[[XHTML]] and [[Cascading style sheets|CSS]] can be used to change the vast majority of the profile to the user's preference. Users also have the option to add embedded music into their profiles via MySpace Music, a service that allows bands to post songs onto their respective profiles. Videos, flash-based content, and almost anything else can be added, much like a standard HTML page. Since many users of MySpace do not know HTML, third-party code generating websites have appeared to help these users.<br/>-<br/>-==MySpace features==<br/>-===Software===<br/>-The company's servers are all running [[Microsoft]] [[IIS]] 6.0 on the [[Windows Server 2003]] [[operating system|OS]].<ref name=netcraft>[http://toolbar.netcraft.com/netblock?q=MYSPA-2,216.178.32.0,216.178.47.255 Netcraft netblock report] for the *.myspace.com netblock (as of September 2006)</ref><br/>-<br/>-===Bulletins===<br/>-Bulletins are messages that are sent out to everyone on a MySpace user's friends list.

The article (which was claimed to have been "professionally fact-checked") recounted a detailed corporate history of MySpace, alleging that what was now regarded as a social networking website had been originally designed as a [[Spam (electronic)|spam]] delivery system aimed at exploiting [[Friendster]], and had initially gained popularity through an intensive mass email campaign rather than word of mouth[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10B12FF38550C758DDDA00894DE404482]. Amongst other claims was the assertion that [[Tom Anderson (MySpace)|Tom Anderson]] had originally been hired as a [[copyeditor]] and his "founder" and "first friend" status was   a [[public relations]] invention. Lapinski suggested that News Corp. had attempted to suppress the publication of the history. News Corp. declined to publicly comment on the article.<br/>-<br/>-====Brad Greenspan / The Free My Space Report ====<br/>-In October 2006, Brad Greenspan (the former Chairman, CEO and largest individual shareholder of Intermix Media and who also claims to be the true "founder of MySpace") launched a [http://freemyspace.com/ website] and published "[http://freemyspace.com/Free_Myspace_Report.htm The Free MySpace Report"] that called for the [[Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]], the [[United States Department of Justice|DoJ]] and the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] Committee on Finance to investigate News Corp's acquisition of MySpace as "one of the largest [[merger and acquisition]] scandals in U.S. history"<br/>-[http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20061005005653&newsLang=en]. The report's main allegation is that News Corp. should have valued MySpace at US$20bn rather than US$327mm, and had, in effect, defrauded Intermix shareholders through an unfair deal process[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/1141294651.html?dids=1141294651:1141294651&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Oct+6%2C+2006&author=Dawn+C.+Chmielewski&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&edition=&startpage=C.1&desc=MySpace+Founder+Seeks+Inquiry]. The report received a mixed response from financial commentators in the press [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15157971/][http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/oct2006/tc20061005_397237.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index_businessweek+exclusives]. A initial lawsuit led by Greenspan challenging the acquisition was dismissed by a judge[http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/288111_myspace10.html].<br/>-<br/>-Greenspan's report also states that the MySpace program code had originally been the brainchild of an Intermix/eUniverse programmer named Toan Nguyen who made the breakthrough technical contributions to the project[http://freemyspace.com/history.htm].<br/>-<br/>-Valleywag speculated that Greenspan was likely a key source for Lapinski's September article[http://www.valleywag.com/tech/myspace/myspace-founder-accuses-company-of-defrauding-investors-of-20-billion-205652.php]. As of November 2006, Lapinski was [http://censorspace.com/?page_id=2 listed] as a staff member of [http://www.censorspace.com CensorSpace.com] - a blog focused on alleged excessive censorship on MySpace and other websites, and which was founded by Greenspan.<br/>-<br/>-===Accessibility===<br/>-   <br/>-Since most MySpace pages are designed by individuals with little [[HTML]] experience, few pages satisfy the criteria for valid HTML laid down by the [[W3C]][http://validator.w3.org]{{fact}} which can cause accessibility problems when visiting many user pages. <!--Even a page with zero user-submitted text doesn't pass.. too bad.. we need a citation soon--> Furthermore, MySpace is set up so that anyone can customize the layout and colors of their profile page with virtually no restrictions, provided that the advertisements aren't covered up by [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] or using other means. As MySpace users may not be skilled [[Web development|web developers]], this can cause further problems. Poorly constructed MySpace profiles could potentially freeze up [[web browser]]s due to malformed CSS coding, or as a result of users placing many high [[Bandwidth#Digital systems|bandwidth]] objects such as videos, graphics, and [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] in their profiles (sometimes multiple videos and soundfiles are automatically played at the same time when a profile loads). [[PC World]] magazine cited this as its main reason for naming MySpace as #1 in its list of 25 worst web sites ever.<ref>{{cite web<br/>-| url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,127116-page,7-c,sites/article.html<br/>-| title = The 25 Worst Web Sites<br/>-| last = Tynan<br/>-| first = Dan<br/>-| publisher = [[PC World]]<br/>-| date = 2006-09-15<br/>-| accessdate = 2006-10-08<br/>-}}</ref><br/>-    <br/>-In addition, new features have been gradually added. This, and the increasing number of MySpace members, leads to an increase in used bandwidth. This increase in usage sometimes slows down the [[Server (computing)|server]]s and may result in a "Server Too Busy" error message for some users who are on at [[peak hour]]s, "Sorry! an unexpected error has occurred. This error has been forwarded to MySpace's technical group.", or a variety of any other error messages throughout the day {{fact}}.<br/>-<br/>-===MySpace and professionalism===   <br/>-The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'''s [[RedEye]] printed an article concerning MySpace and an individual's search for employment. It was argued that young college graduates compromise their chances of starting careers because of the content they post onto their profiles. For instance, a visitor does not need an account to browse for users using information that is readily available on resumes and applications, such as a postal code and age. A potential employer can utilize information provided by the applicant on MySpace's search engine. Thus, the employer may not hire a highly qualified candidate because he or she maintains an account suggesting rambunctious behaviour. Moreover, employees were said to be putting their careers at risk because they maintain blogs that criticize their respective companies and organizations{{fact}}.<!-- someone get the name of the article!--><br/>-<br/>-===Security===<br/>-In October 2005, a flaw in the MySpace's site design was exploited by a user only known as "Samy" to create the world's first self-propagating cross-site scripting (XSS) worm (see [[Samy (XSS)]]). [[MSNBC]] has also reported that MySpace is a "hotbed" for [[spyware]], and that infection rates are rising because of MySpace.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14413906/ | title=Social-networking sites a 'hotbed' for spyware| publisher =MSNBC}}</ref>  In addition to this, the customization of user pages currently allows the injection of certain HTML which can be crafted to form a [[phishing]] user profile.<ref>{{cite web<br/>-| url=http://mashable.com/2006/10/27/myspace-phishing-attack-appears-on-3000-pages/<br/>-| title=MySpace Phishing Attack Appears on 3000 Pages<br/>-}}</ref> <br/>-<br/>-===Child Safety===<br/>-MySpace allows registering users who are as young as 14.<ref>{{cite web<br/>-| url=http://collect.myspace.com/misc/terms.html<br/>-| title=MySpace terms of service<br/>-}}</ref> Profiles with ages set to 14 to 15 years are automatically private.

Accessing the full profile of or messaging someone under the age of 16 is restricted to a MySpace user's direct friends only if the account is set to 'private'.<br/>-<br/>-[[U.S. House Of Representatives|U.S. Congressman]] [[Mike Fitzpatrick]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Pennsylvania|PA]]) has also introduced controversial legislation (H.R.5319) to ban usage of the site in public places, such as schools and libraries, and to have the power to tap into usage of the website in those places.<br/>-<br/>-MySpace often has problems with profile identity theft. These are profiles containing the pictures and sometimes information of someone else's profile. These stolen profiles are commonly used to advertise websites.

In the same month, 16-year-old [[Katherine Lester]] flew to the Middle East after having tricked her parents into getting her a passport in order to be with a 20-year-old man she met through MySpace. US officials in Jordan persuaded the teen to turn around and go home.<br/>-<br/>-===Social and cultural===<br/>-Dave Itzkoff, in the June 2006 issue of ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine, related his experiences experimenting with membership in MySpace.  Among his criticisms are that the distance afforded by the Internet emboldens members, such as females who feature photos of themselves in little clothing on their profile pages, to behave in ways that they would not behave in person, and that this duplicity undercuts the central philosophy of MySpace, which is to bring people together.  Itzkoff also references the addictive, time-consuming nature of the site, mentioning that ''Playboy'' Playmate and MySpace member [[Julie McCullough]], who was the first to respond to his Add request, refers to the site as "cybercrack".  Itzkoff claims that MySpace gives many people access to a member’s life, without giving the time needed to maintain such relationships, and that such relationships do not possess the depth of in-person relationships.<br/>-<br/>-Itzkoff is particularly critical of the disturbing and fraudulent behavior of people who can contact a member, unsolicited, as when he was contacted by someone expressing a desire to socialize and date, but whose blog (to which Itzkoff was directed via subsequent emails) turned out to be a solicitation for a series of commercial porn sites.  Itzkoff is also critical of more subtle commercial solicitations on the site, such as the banner ads and links to profiles and video clips that turn out to be commercials for new [[20th Century Fox]] films.  Itzkoff also observes that MySpace’s much-celebrated music section is heavily weighted in favor of record labels rather than breakthrough musicians.<br/>-<br/>-Itzkoff also relates criticism from another person he calls "Judas", who asserts that while the goal of attempting to bring together people who might not otherwise associate with one another in real life may seem honorable, it violates a social contract that exists when people interact in person, which render MySpace nothing more than a passing fad:<br/>-<br/>-:"There will come a moment when, like deer quivering and flicking up their ears toward a noiseless noise in the woods, the first adopters will suddenly realize they’re spending their time blogging and adding and gawking at the same alarming photos an army of 14-year olds are and, quick as deer, they’ll dash to the next trend.  And before you know it, we’ll all follow.”<br/>-<br/>-==Musicians' rights and MySpace Terms of Use Agreement==<br/>-Until June 2006, there was a concern amongst musicians, artists, and bands on MySpace such as songwriter [[Billy Bragg]] owing to the fine print within the user agreement that read, "You hereby grant to MySpace.com a non-exclusive, fully-paid and royalty-free, worldwide license (with the right to sublicense through unlimited levels of sublicensees) to use, copy, modify, adapt, translate, publicly perform, publicly display, store, reproduce, transmit, and distribute such Content on and through the Services".<br/>-The fine print brought particular concern as the agreement was being made with [[Rupert Murdoch|Murdoch]]'s [[News Corporation]]. [[Billy Bragg]] brought the issue to the attention of the media during the first week of June 2006.<ref name="InquirerBragg">{{cite news<br/>-| url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/06/08/blly_bragg_myspace/<br/>-| publisher=The Register<br/>-| title=Billy Bragg prompts MySpace Rethink<br/>-| last=Orlowski<br/>-| first=Andrew<br/>-| date=2006-06-8<br/>-| accessdate=2006-09-12<br/>-}}</ref> Jeff Berman, a MySpace spokesman swiftly responded by saying, "Because the legalese has caused some confusion, we are at work revising it to make it very clear that MySpace is not seeking a license to do anything with an artist's work other than allow it to be shared in the manner the artist intends". <br/>-<br/>-By [[June 27]], [[2006]] MySpace had amended the user agreement with, "MySpace.com does not claim any ownership rights in the text, files, images, photos, video, sounds, musical works, works of authorship, or any other materials (collectively, 'Content') that you post to the MySpace Services. After posting your Content to the MySpace Services, you continue to retain all ownership rights in such Content, and you continue to have the right to use your Content in any way you choose".<br/>-<br/>-==Blocking==   <br/>-Many schools and public libraries in the United States and the United Kingdom have restricted access to MySpace because it has become "such a haven for student gossip and malicious comments".<ref>{{cite news|work=Curriculum Review|date=October 2005|title=Schools race to restrict MySpace}}</ref> A Catholic school in New Jersey has even prohibited students from using MySpace at home, although experts questioned the legality of such a ban.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tdn.com/articles/2006/01/22/top_story/news01.txt|title=The MySpace case|work=The Daily News, Longview, Washington|date=[[2006-01-22]]|accessdate=2006-02-15}}</ref> In Autumn 2005 [[Pope John XXIII Regional High School]] in [[Sparta Township, New Jersey]] made headlines by forbidding its students to have pages on MySpace or similar websites or face suspension.<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1512215/20051025/index.jhtml?headlines=true]</ref> The school claimed that this action was made to protect its students from online predators.<ref>[http://www.dailyrecord.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051024/NEWS01/510240324/1005 Blogging ban provokes a debate over cyberspace: Pope John H.S. demands that online profiles end, calls forums havens for sexual predators], ''Daily Record'', [[October 24]], [[2005]]</ref><br/>-<br/>-On [[July 28]] [[2006]], the United States House of Representatives passed a controversial bill requiring libraries and schools receiving certain types of federal funding ([[E-rate]]) to prevent unsupervised minors from using chat rooms and social networking websites, such as MySpace.

The June 2006 issue of ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine, for example, featured a "Women of MySpace" nude pictorial (though ironically, an article somewhat critical of the website ran in the same issue). Through MySpace, such people are able to distribute information regarding their activities, events they are hosting, or projects they are working on (e.g. albums or clothing lines). Though some of these individuals have remained only [[Internet celebrity|Internet celebrities]], others have been able to jump to television, magazines, and radio. One example is [[Christine Dolce|Christine "ForBiddeN" Dolce]]'s appearance on ''[[The Tyra Banks Show]]''.<br/>-<br/>-Furthermore, MySpace's music section has helped many amateur bands progress. One illustrative example is English band [[Arctic Monkeys]], who owe some of their success to the publicity that MySpace generated for them. When asked about the popularity of the band's MySpace website in an interview with ''Prefix'' magazine, the band pointed out that they did not even know what MySpace was, and that their page had originally been created by their fans. It has been claimed that [[Pop music|Pop]] artist [[Lily Allen]]'s new fame is also due in part to her being promoted on MySpace but Lily herself denies this. In response to an interview question on [[Triple J]], [[Australia]] Lily stated<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.abc.net.au/jtv/video/default.htm?clip=myspace<br/>-| title = triple j radio, Australia - video piece about MySpace | publisher = triple j/ABC}}</ref>, "The way it's been portrayed in the media, is that you were almost like discovered by MySpace; how accurate is that?" Lily responded "Not accurate at all, I had a record deal before I set up my MySpace account so, erm, that's ... couldn't really be further from the truth."<br/>-<br/>-==Rivalry with YouTube==<br/>-[[YouTube]] first appeared on the web in early 2005, and it quickly gained popularity on MySpace due to MySpace members who embedded YouTube videos in their MySpace profiles. Realizing the competitive threat to the new MySpace Videos service, MySpace banned embedded YouTube videos from its user profiles.

The [[Sheffield School of Medicine]] was founded in 1828. This was followed in 1879 by the opening of [[Firth College]] by [[Mark Firth]], a [[steel]] manufacturer, to teach [[arts]] and [[science]] subjects. Firth College then helped to fund the opening of the [[Sheffield Technical School]] in 1884 to teach [[applied science]], the only major faculty the existing colleges did not cover. The three institutions merged in 1897 to form the '''University College of Sheffield'''.<br/>+<br/>+[[Image:Sheffield Nov 2005 011.jpg|left|thumb|Firth Court]]<br/>+<br/>+It was originally envisaged that the University College would join [[Victoria University of Manchester|Manchester]], [[University of Liverpool|Liverpool]] and [[University of Leeds|Leeds]] as the fourth member of the federal [[Victoria University (UK)|Victoria University]]. However, the Victoria University began to split-up before this could happen and so the University College of Sheffield received its own [[Royal Charter]] in 1905 and became the '''University of Sheffield'''.<br/>+<br/>+From 114 full-time students in 1905, the University grew slowly until the 1950s and 1960s when it began to expand rapidly. Many new buildings (including the famous [[Arts Tower]]) were built and student numbers increased to their present levels of over 20,000.<br/>+<br/>+Development has continued since. In 1995, the University took over the [[Sheffield and North Trent College of Nursing and Midwifery]], which greatly increased the size of the medical faculty.  In 2005 it decided to pass these subjects over to [[Sheffield Hallam University]].<br/>+<br/>+Over the years, the University has been home to a number of famous writers and scholars, including the literary critic [[William Empson]], who was head of the Department of English; author [[Angela Carter]]; the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|Nobel Prize]]-winning chemist [[Harry Kroto|Sir Harry Kroto]] and [[Bernard Crick]], who taught politics with future [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] politician [[David Blunkett]] as one of his students.<br/>+<br/>+==Location==<br/>+[[Image:Shefuniartstower.JPG|thumb|The [[Arts Tower]]]]<br/>+<br/>+The University of Sheffield is not a [[campus university]], though most of its buildings are close together. The centre of the University's presence lies one mile to the west of Sheffield city centre where there is a mile-long collection of buildings belonging almost entirely to the University. This area includes the [[students' union]], the [[Octagon Centre]], Firth Court, the Geography building, the [[Alfred Denny Building]] (housing [[natural sciences]] and including a small [[museum]]), the Dainton and Richard Roberts Buildings ([[chemistry]]) and the Hicks Building ([[mathematics]] and [[physics]]). The [[Listed building|Grade II*-listed]] library and [[Arts Tower]] are also located there. A concourse under the main road allows students to easily move between these buildings.<br/>+<br/>+East lies St George's Campus, named for [[St George's Church, Portobello|St George's Church]], now a [[lecture theatre]]. The campus is centred on Mappin Street, home to a number of University buildings, including the faculty of [[engineering]] (partly housed in the [[Listed building|Grade II-listed]] [[Mappin Building]]) and the departments of [[management]] and [[computer science]]. The University also maintains the [[Turner Museum of Glass]] in this area. The University has recently acquired the nearby former [[Jessop Hospital]] and HSE Building and plans to convert these to house more departments, thus fully joining the West and St. George's campuses. <br/>+[[Image:Crookesmoor_2.jpg|thumb|The Crookesmoor Building, home of the Faculty of Law]]<br/>+<br/>+Further west lies [[Weston Park]] parkland, the [[Weston Park Museum]], the [[Harold Cantor Gallery]], sports facilities and the faculties of [[law]] in the [[Crookesmoor]] area and [[medicine]], in the [[Royal Hallamshire Hospital]] (although taught in the city's extensive [[teaching hospital]]s under the [[Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust]], and throughout [[South Yorkshire]] and [[North East Lincolnshire]]).<br/>+<br/>+Further west still lie the University [[halls of residence]], [[Ranmoor House]], [[Halifax Hall of Residence|Halifax]], [[Stephenson Hall of Residence|Stephenson]] and [[Tapton Hall of Residence|Tapton]], and the [[music]] department, in the [[Broomhill, Sheffield, South Yorkshire|Broomhill]] and [[Crookes]] areas of the city.<br/>+<br/>+The [[Manvers campus]], at [[Wath-on-Dearne]] between [[Rotherham]] and [[Barnsley]], is where the majority of nursing is taught.<br/>+<br/>+==Controversy==<br/>+Over the years there has been must controversy caused by students at the University.<br/>+<br/>+Undergraduate psychology student, Kevin J. Courtney, caused a furore on the 21st November 2006 after a disagreement with a psychology department cleaner. The cleaner asked the inocuous question of whether or not Mr Courtney was waiting to attend a lecture, only to be answered with a barrage of abuse. The Sheffield University Foundation, Cleaner's For a University of Non-negativity and Trust (CUNT) are investigating the issue.<br/>+<br/>+On the 18th November 2006 English Literature student Adam Woellhaf caused uproar when, during a lecture, he proclaimed his love for the deceased actress/singer [[Judy Garland]]. When questioned afterwards, he stated that "her heavenly voice is always in my heart". This is not, however, the first time that Mr Woellhaf has caused controversy within the University. Prior to this incident he was spotted erecting "Morrisey is God" posters in and arround the University.<br/>+<br/>+<br/>+==Organisation==<br/>+[[Image:University of Sheffield coat of arms.png|thumb|The University of Sheffield's [[coat of arms]], granted when the University received its Royal Charter in 1905, on which the University's current logo is based]]<br/>+Like most British universities, the University of Sheffield is headed by a [[Vice-Chancellor]], [[Bob Boucher|Prof Bob Boucher, CBE]] and a [[titular]] [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]], [[Peter Middleton|Sir Peter Middleton]].

It was also named the [[Sunday Times University of the Year]] in 2001. In 2005, the Sunday Times rated the University as the 24th best in the UK.<br/>+<br/>+Sheffield is particularly famous for its [[Archaeology]], [[Architecture]], [[Chemistry]], Engineering, [[English studies|English]], [[History]], Music, [[Philosophy]] and [[Politics]] departments, which are heavily oversubscribed.<br/>+<br/>+Major research partners and clients include Boeing, Rolls Royce, Unilever, Boots, AstraZeneca, GSK, ICI, Slazenger, and many more household names, as well as UK and overseas government agencies and charitable foundations.<br/>+<br/>+==Nobel Prizes==<br/>+The University's Faculty of Pure Science may boast an association with four [[Nobel Prizes]], one for the Department of [[Molecular Biology]] and [[Biotechnology]]:<br/>+* (1953 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]], Prof. Hans Adolf Krebs, "for the discovery of the [[citric acid cycle]] in [[cellular respiration]]")<br/>+<br/>+As well as three to its world-renowned Department of Chemistry:<br/>+* (1967 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] (joint award), [[George Porter|Prof. George Porter]] (later Lord Porter), "for their work on extremely fast chemical reactions" (see [[Flash photolysis]])<br/>+* 1993 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (joint award), [[Richard J.

Howard Florey was the Joseph Hunter Professor of Pathology at Sheffield from 1932 until his move to Oxford in 1935.  In 1945 Florey and his colleague Ernst Chain, together with Alexander Fleming were awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their work on penicillin.<br/>+<br/>+==Students and faculty==<br/>+The University of Sheffield's 25,000 students arrive mostly from the [[United Kingdom|UK]], but 2,500 are international students, with many from [[Malaysia]].<br/>+<br/>+The university employs 5,500 people, including almost 1,400 academic staff.<br/>+<br/>+==Students' union, sports and traditions==<br/>+The [[University of Sheffield Union of Students]] is one of the largest students' union in the UK, with two bars (Bar One (which has a bookable function room with its own bar, The Raynor Lounge) and The Interval), three club venues (Fusion, Foundry and Octagon), one off-campus public house (The Fox and Duck), the cinema [[Film Unit]], over one hundred student societies, many sports teams and a turnover of around £8,000,000.<br/>+<br/>+The [[University of Sheffield Union of Students]] also has a [[student radio]] station called [[Sure Radio]].

While there is significant disagreement over whether a War on Christmas exists, the term itself is accepted and used by most pundits and commentators of either side.<br/> <br/>-The Rangers began play in the [[1927|1926-27]] season, and quickly became one of the league's most successful teams, both competitively and financially.  They won the Stanley Cup in [[1928]], [[1933]] and [[1940]], and their games were usually sold out.<br/>+Prominent [[conservative]] media commentators [[John Gibson]], [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] and [[Sean Hannity]] of the [[Fox News Channel]] are the main proponents of the theory.  However, most print and television media outlets are skeptical, calling it a [[conspiracy theory]] or a deliberate attempt to further a conservative Christian agenda. {{ref_num|goldberg|1}} <br/> <br/>-==Possible explanations for Curse==<br/>-In the [[1941|1940-41]] season, the mortgage on their arena, [[Madison Square Garden]], the current edition of which had been built in [[1925]], was paid off.  The management of the Madison Square Garden Corporation burned the mortgage in the bowl of the Cup.  This led some hockey fans to believe that the Cup, which they consider to be a sacred object, had been desecrated, leading "the hockey gods" to place a curse on the Rangers.<br/>+Both the alleged War on Christmas and the universally acknowledged conflict between the [[secular]] and [[religious]] aspects of Christmas and the associated, larger, December holiday season have caused a considerable amount of controversy. The expressions "[[Happy Holidays]]", "[[Season's Greetings]]", and "[[Xmas]]" are commonly given examples of the secularization of Christmas. Other cases cited as being part of the war include dropping or replacing the word "Christmas" in greetings and public statements and bans on Christmas decorations on public property. While the recent controversy over the War on Christmas is mostly restricted to the United States of America, it has become a topic of minor interest in [[Canada]] and the [[United Kingdom]] as well.<br/> <br/>-Another theory is that the curse came from [[Mervyn "Red" Dutton]], the coach and general manager of the [[New York Americans]], for whom he had once played.  The Amerks were actually the first NHL team to play in [[New York City]], beginning play as soon as the Garden opened in the [[1926|1925-26]] season.  However, not having the financial backing of the Garden Corporation, the Amerks struggled, and the NHL took over ownership of the team in [[1937]].  They made five playoff appearances, including a loss to the Rangers in [[1929]] and a win over the Rangers in [[1938]].  But their loss to the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] in the 1938 Stanley Cup Semifinals was the closest they were ever get to winning the Cup.<br/>+==Background==<br/>+[[Image:Jsmc-bracelet.jpg|frame|15,000 "Just Say 'Merry Christmas' " bracelets have been sold {{ref_num|davis|2}}]]<br/>+The idea of a war on Christmas in America has gained prominence following extensive coverage on the [[Fox News Channel]]. That channel's commentators [[Bill O'Reilly]] and [[Sean Hannity]] first spoke of a "war on Christmas" in the months leading up to the 2004 holiday season, and picked up the topic again in late 2005. Discussions of the idea are, however, common on the [[Internet]], especially in the [[blogosphere]].<br/> <br/>-Following the [[1942|1941-42]] season, with so many players having entered the armed forces to fight in [[World War II]], and the Americans hurt by this more than most teams, the league folded the franchise.  Dutton blamed Ranger management for encouraging league officials to do so.  The only compensation he received was to be named NHL President in [[1943]], a post he held until [[1946]].<br/>+[[Image:War on Christmas book by John Gibson.jpg|thumb|left|''The War on Christmas'' by John Gibson]]<br/>+Another proponent of the idea, [[John Gibson (media host)|John Gibson]], wrote a book entitled ''The War on Christmas: How the Liberal Plot to Ban the Sacred Christian Holiday Is Worse Than You Thought'' (ISBN 1595230165), which was published in October of 2005. <br/> <br/>-There is no evidence that Dutton used his position as President to hurt the Rangers' chances to win the Stanley Cup.  But he was bitter, and declared that the Rangers would never win the Cup for as long as he lived.  He died in [[1987]], at the age of 88.  At that time, the Rangers were in their 47th season without having won the Cup.<br/>+Gibson and others claim the "War on Christmas" is part of a broader "[[culture war]]" waged by progressives. O'Reilly claimed that "it's all part of the secular progressive agenda ... to get Christianity and spirituality and Judaism out of the public square." He also went on to say that this larger agenda includes "legalization of narcotics, euthanasia, abortion at will, gay marriage." {{ref_num|mediamatters1|3}}<br/>+In the recent movement, Gibson has charged that a wide array of groups, including "liberals," "secular progressives," the ACLU, the [[Anti-Defamation League]], and [[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]] are the forces behind the attack, while O'Reilly has focused more narrowly on the ACLU and billionaire financier [[George Soros]]. {{ref_num|mediamatters2|4}} {{ref_num|dailykos1|5}} Though O'Reilly has recently narrowed his scope, in the past he has even [[Blame Canada|blamed Canada]]. {{ref_num|oreilly1|6}}<br/> <br/>-The Curse of 1940 worked in several ways, some of them odd.  The Madison Square Garden Corporation found it could make more money when the circus came to town in the spring, and this forced the Rangers, and later the [[National Basketball Association]]'s [[New York Knickerbockers]], to use different arenas at the worst possible time, during their respective leagues' playoffs.  The Rangers used [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] in Toronto as their "home ice" in the [[1950]] Stanley Cup Finals, and lost to the [[Detroit Red Wings]].  At the time, most fans simply believed the Rangers were victims of bad management, not of a curse.<br/>+In part, O'Reilly frames his argument as pro-business.  "Every company in America should be on their knees thanking Jesus for being born.  Without Christmas, most American businesses would be far less profitable," O'Reilly said on a [[Fox News]] program.  "More than enough reason for business to be screaming 'Merry Christmas'."  Critics, however, point out that attempting to include non-Christians in Christmas by genericising the holiday is a wholly [[capitalism|capitalistic]] method of increasing profits — the more people affected by marketing, the more people will come out and purchase. {{ref_num|saunders|7}}<br/> <br/>-==New rivals to enforce old Curse==<br/>-The Rangers rarely made the playoffs during the 1950s and 1960s.  In [[1972]], they reached the Stanley Cup Finals again, this time losing to the [[Boston Bruins]].  Although nothing bizarre happened during the Finals, as has often happened with alleged sports curses, they had now gone 32 years without winning the Cup.  The next season began with the founding of an expansion team playing on [[Long Island]], the [[New York Islanders]].  In [[1975]], the Islanders reached the playoffs for the first time and defeated the Rangers.  The teams played again in 1979, and the Rangers won, advancing to the Finals, where they lost to the [[Montreal Canadiens]], although this was not unusual, either, since it was the Canadiens' fourth consecutive Cup.<br/>+A Fox News / Opinion Dynamics poll for [[November 29]]&ndash;[[November 30|30]], 2005 found that 42% of respondents believe that "there is a War on Christmas in the US today," with 48% in disagreement. [[Media Matters for America]], a [[watchdog journalism|watchdog]] group critical of conservative media, reported that from Monday, [[November 28]], to Friday, [[December 2]], Fox News aired 58 different reports, interviews, and debates about the War on Christmas. {{ref_num|mediamatters3|8}} <br/> <br/>-The Islanders won the Stanley Cup for the first time in [[1980]], beginning a streak of four consecutive championships, one more than the Rangers had won in their entire 57-year history to that point.  Fans of the younger franchise began chanting, "NINE-teen-FOR-ty!" during games between the teams, particularly in the tense [[1984]] playoff series won by the Islanders in overtime of the deciding fifth game.  This chant caught on around the league.  It was also in the 1980s that the idea of a "Curse of 1940" began to take hold, with Red Dutton's death in [[1987]] and the occasional publication of the photograph of the Garden mortgage being burned in the Cup's bowl.  (The "old Garden" was demolished after the Rangers and Knicks moved into the "new Garden" in [[1968]].)<br/>+*On the [[December 19]] edition of Fox News Channel's The O'Reilly Factor, O'Reilly declared "'Happy Holidays' is fine" [http://mediamatters.org/items/200512200007]<br/> <br/>-In [[1992]], the Rangers finished with the best overall record in the NHL, earning them the [[President's Trophy]], but they lost to the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] in the [[Patrick Division]] Finals.  Although the Penguins were defending champions, and their victory was hardly a shocking one, there was an odd moment when [[goaltender]] [[Mike Richter]] allowed a shot from the blue line by [[Ron Francis]] past him.  The next season, with hopes high, the Rangers finished last, largely because of an injury to [[defenseman]] [[Brian Leetch]].  In the kind of incident many fans ascribe to curses, Leetch arrived at the Garden in a taxi, stepped out, and broke his ankle when he slipped on a patch of ice, a most ironic injury for a hockey player.<br/>+A [[December 23]], [[2005]] media survey by Media Matters for America claimed that the overwhelming majority of media reports criticise or ridicule the concept of the "war on Christmas". Media Matters reviewed all print publications marked as "News" in the [[LexisNexis]] database, and found only 18 articles or op-ed pieces supporting the "war on Christmas", and 106 dismissing the claim or describing them as exaggerated. Interestingly, 5 of the 14 pro-war pieces were printed in Canadian, not US, media. {{ref_num|mediamatters4|9}}<br/> <br/>-==End of the Curse==<br/>-The Rangers advanced to the [[Eastern Conference]] Finals in [[1994]], having not won the Stanley Cup in 54 years.  In that time, championships had been won in the New York area by the Islanders (four), the [[New York Yankees]] (14), the [[New York Mets]] (two), the [[New York Giants]] baseball team (one, and they had been in [[San Francisco]] since [[1958]]), the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] (one, and they had been in [[Los Angeles]] since [[1958]]), the [[New York Giants]] football team (three), the [[New York Jets]] (one), and the Knicks (two).<br/>+==Comparisons made between Fox News theme and others==<br/>+According to Michelle Goldberg in [[Salon.com]], there are some limited similarities between the current ''War on Christmas'' theme, and past fringe political arguments. <br/> <br/>-The Rangers played the [[New Jersey Devils]], who had begun play in the [[1983|1982-83]] season and had never won the Cup yet.  The Rangers had already beaten the Devils in the [[1992]] Patrick Division Semifinals.  Devils fans had picked up the "1940" chant and the curse myth from Islander fans, and it was noted that the hockey seating capacity of the [[Brendan Byrne]] Arena (later renamed the [[Continental Airlines Arena]]) was 19,040.  It looked like the curse was at work again with the Rangers trailing three games to two and facing elimination when captain [[Mark Messier]] challenged the New York media by guaranteeing a win in game 6. The Rangers fell behind 2-0 quickly but trailing 2-1 in the third period, Messier scored a [[natural hat trick]] (three straight goals) to make good on his guarantee and force a deciding seventh game. The curse threatened again in game 7 as the Rangers led 1-0 and looked as though they were about to advance to the Cup Finals when [[Valeri Zelepukin]] scored with 7.7 seconds remaining in regulation to tie the game.  But in the second overtime, [[Stephane Matteau]] scored on a wraparound goal to give the Rangers the game and the series.<br/>+She argues a parallel to [[anti-Semitic]] automaker [[Henry Ford]]'s claims in ''The International Jew: The World's Foremost Problem'' ISBN 0766178293. Ford had stated that "most people had a hard time finding Christmas cards that indicated in any way that Christmas commemorated Someone's Birth." Ford also stated that the alleged de-Christianization was a secret plot of the [[Jewish]] designers of Christmas cards. Ford also claimed "Christmas celebrations or carols in [[Philadelphia]], [[Cincinnati]], [[St. Paul]] and [[New York City|New York]] met with strong Jewish opposition."<br/> <br/>-The Rangers moved on to the Stanley Cup Finals, and defeated the [[Vancouver Canucks]] in seven games with Messier scoring the Cup-winning goal.  The city of [[Vancouver]] has actually waited longer to win the Cup, as the Canucks only began NHL play in [[1970]], and the last team from the city to win the Cup was the [[Vancouver Millionaires]] in [[1915]].  The Rangers ended their Stanley Cup drought at 54 years.  A fan at the Garden held up a sign saying, "NOW I CAN DIE IN PEACE." The slogan began to appear on T-shirts around the New York area.<br/>+Goldberg also argues that there are parallels with the 1959 [[John Birch Society]] pamphlet titled "There Goes Christmas?!". The pamphlet claimed [[Communists]] along with the [[United Nations]] were behind an plot to [[Secularisation|secularize]] Christmas.  Writer [[Hubert Kregeloh]] alleged "One of the techniques now being applied by the Reds to weaken the pillar of religion in our country is the drive to take Christ out of Christmas — to denude the event of its religious meaning...They are already busy...on efforts to poison the 1959 Christmas season with their high-pressure propaganda. What they now want to put over on the American people is simply this: [[Department store]]s throughout the country are to utilize UN symbols and emblems as Christmas decorations." The pamplet rallied Americans against UN promotion to "fight back by informing department stores that those with improper ornamentation wouldn't be getting their business." {{ref_num|cline|25}}<br/> <br/>-A year later, in [[1995]], the Devils recovered from their crushing defeat by the Rangers and won the Stanley Cup, beating the Red Wings in four straight, and a fan held up a sign saying, "NOW I CAN LIVE IN PEACE." The Devils have also won the Cup in [[2000]] and [[2003]].  The Islanders have not won the Cup since 1983, although no "curse" has yet been suggested as a reason.<br/>+However Goldberg is quick to point out she does not mean to imply [[guilt by association]] with the simlarities to the present theme. She writes in part: <br/>+"To compare today's "war on Christmas" demagogues to Henry Ford is not to call them anti-Semites. Rather, they are purveyors of a conspiracy theory that repeatedly crops up in America. The malefactors change -- Jews, the U.N., the ACLU -- but the outlines stay the same. The scheme is always massive, reaching up to the highest levels of power."<br/> <br/>-==New Curse?==<br/>-The possibility exists that the Rangers allowed themselves to be cursed again.  After their 1994 win, one of the places to which they took the Cup was [[Belmont Park]], a [[horse racing]] track.  Since Belmont Park is just outside [[New York City]] in the town of [[Elmont]], in [[Nassau County]], this visit was in the Islanders' territory.  Some Ranger players put oats in the bowl of the Cup, and [[Go For Gin]], the horse that had won the [[Kentucky Derby]] the previous month, was allowed to eat out of the Cup.<br/>+The campaign to stop the commercialization of Christmas and other Christian holidays has been, by far, the prevailing U.S. effort to save Christian tradition. In American popular culture, this was famously recognised in a 1997 episode of [[Seinfeld]]. Frank Costanza (Jerry Stiller) in the television sitcom Seinfeld first described his new holiday, called Festivus, created in protest of the commercialization of Christmas. Festivus celebrators eschewed traditional decoration except for a simple, but sturdy, aluminum pole. A real-life, worldwide, nondenominational movement was subsequently born celebrating a ''Festivus for the rest of us!''<br/> <br/>-Since that 1994 win, the Rangers have reached the Eastern Conference Finals only once, in [[1997]], losing to the [[Philadelphia Flyers]].  The Rangers entered the [[2006|2005-06]] season having not made the playoffs since that 1997 loss, despite having one of the league's highest payrolls and some of its top stars.  The Knicks have also fallen short of playoff success since their last appearance in the [[NBA Finals]] in [[1999]], although no one has yet suggested that a "curse" might be on the Knicks.<br/>+Many other, arguably more serious anti-commercialization campaigns have long existed. Notably, the [[Catholic]] [[Fraternal and service organizations|fraternal society]] the [[Knights of Columbus]] since the early 1980s, has conducted a "Keep Christ in Christmas" program for Catholics, including publishing [[Public Service Announcement]]s for video outlets. {{ref_num|knights|26}}<br/> <br/>-Some blame the failures of the Rangers and Knicks on the management of the Madison Square Garden Corporation, led by [[Cablevision]] executive [[James Dolan]], mistrusted by fans due to the fact that the Garden sells out for every Ranger game and nearly every Knick game, so he and his company make a profit no matter how the teams perform.  But after eleven years of not winning the Stanley Cup again, perhaps there are once again larger forces at work for the Rangers.<br/>+==Specific incidents==<br/>+The following incidents are examples of secularization of Christmas, reactions to secularization, and notable claims of secularization that proved to be false.<br/> <br/>-[[Category:New York Rangers]]<br/>-[[Category:Curses]]<br/>+* The [[Republican National Committee]] posted a "Happy Holidays" message on its home page on [[24 December]], [[2005]].{{ref_num|GOPholidays|11}}<br/>+<br/>+* [[Target Corporation|Target, Inc.]] planned a secular advertising campaign for "holiday" items, including trees, decorations, gifts, and more.

The company responded officially to the criticism from opponents of secularization, issuing a letter stating: "Next year, you can be assured our advertising will better incorporate 'Christmas', and our holiday trees will be called Christmas trees.

The charge was made by O'Reilly and then also on Fox by [[Mathew Staver]] of [[Liberty Counsel]].  However, the school had not changed any lyrics, but had instead presented a Christmas play, ''The Little Tree's Christmas Gift'', written in 1988.  In the play, the title character, a small and unwanted [[Christmas tree]], sings about his loneliness, to the tune of "Silent Night".  The play has also been performed in several churches.

Most liked it or were indifferent, while others despised it for being 'too irritating'. There is no doubt that Jake's personality is a homage to the second and third-generation immigrants who willingly embraced American culture (and adapted to its varying accents). This may also explain why Jake transforms into a western-style dragon instead of an eastern-style Lung like Lao Shi.'' <br/>-<br/>-Actually I think maybe Grandpa moved to NY at one point and the rest of the family desended from China but were born in the US.

Season, character, and other information are somewhat mixed together.

It's just like when [[Dexter's Laboratory]] got new animators...the animation was very sloppy and because of new writers, the episodes were pretty bad. I just hope this doesn't happen to ADJL... -- [[User:RattleMan|RattleMan]] 23:14, 27 May 2006 (UTC)<br/>-<br/>-:Yeah, and from what I saw on the commercials for the 2nd season of the show, the backgrounds changed to look [[Proud Family]]-esque. The backgrounds of the first season were PERFECTLY fine, and the animation looks cruder for the 2nd season. Of course to verify this I actually need to watch an episode, and hey, maybe I'll like it. And if not, they've just tried to fix something that wasn't broken. And failed to do so.

He answered that Tiberius would never have given such an order. Being pressed on the point, though, Blossius eventually stated that Tiberius would only have ordered such a thing, if it were in the true interests of the Roman people. After that, he was released.

Winston's politician father, [[Lord Randolph Churchill]], was the third son of the 7th Duke of Marlborough: Winston's mother was [[Jennie Jerome]] (née Jeanette Jerome) of [[Brooklyn, New York]], a daughter of American millionaire [[Leonard Jerome]].<br/>+<br/>+In [[1893]] he enrolled in the Royal Military College. He graduated two years later ranked eighth in his class. He was appointed Second Lieutenant in the 4th Hussars cavalry. In [[1895]], he went to [[Cuba]] as a military observer with the [[Spain|Spanish]] army in its fight against the independentists. He also reported for the [[Saturday Review]]. In [[1898]] he rode as a reporter with the 21st Lancers at the [[Battle of Omdurman]].<br/>+<br/>+The first notable appearance of Winston Churchill was as a [[war correspondent]] in the second [[Boer War|Anglo-Boer war]] between Britain and self-proclaimed [[Afrikaaners]] in [[South Africa]]. He was captured in a [[Boer]] ambush of a British Army train convoy, but managed a high profile escape and eventually crossed the South African border to [[Lourenço Marques]] (now [[Maputo]] in [[Mozambique]]).<br/>+Churchill used the status achieved to begin a political career which would last a total of sixty-five years, first standing for [[Parliament]] in [[1899]] and serving as an MP in the House of Commons from [[1900]] to [[1922]] and from [[1924]] to [[1964]]. At first a member of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], he  'crossed the floor' in [[1904]] to join the [[Liberal Party (UK)| Liberals]].<br/>+<br/>+In the [[UK general election, 1906|1906 general election]], Churchill won a seat in [[Manchester]]. In the Liberal government of [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] he served as [[Under-Secretary of State]] for the Colonies. Churchill soon became the most prominent member of the Government outside the Cabinet, and when Campbell Bannerman was succeeded by [[Herbert Henry Asquith]] in [[1908]], it came as little surprise when Churchill was promoted to the Cabinet as [[President of the Board of Trade]]. Under the law at the time, a newly appointed Cabinet Minister was obliged to seek re-election at a by-election. Churchill lost his Manchester seat to the Conservative [[William Joynson-Hicks, 1st Viscount Brentford|William Joynson-Hicks]], but was soon elected in another by-election at Dundee. As President of the Board of Trade he pursued radical social reforms in conjunction with [[David Lloyd George]], the new [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]].<br/>+In [[1910]] Churchill was promoted to [[Home Secretary]], where he was to prove somewhat controversial. A famous photograph from the time shows the impetuous Churchill taking personal charge of the January [[1911]] [[Sidney Street Siege]], peering around a corner to view a fierce gun battle between cornered anarchists and Scots Guards. His role attracted much criticism. Arthur Balfour asked, "He [Churchill] and a photographer were both risking valuable lives. I understand what the photographer was doing but what was the Right Honourable gentleman doing?"<br/>+<br/>+[[Image:Sidney street churchill.jpg|thumb|Winston Churchill (highlighted) at Sidney Street, 3 January 1911]]<br/>+In [[1911]], Churchill became [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], a post he would hold into the [[First World War]]. He was one of the political and military engineers of the disastrous [[Gallipoli]] landings on the [[Dardanelles]] during [[World War I]], which led to his description as "the butcher of Gallipoli". When Asquith formed an all-party coalition government, the Conservatives demanded Churchill's demotion as the price for entry. For several months Churchill served in the non-portfolio job of [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]], before resigning from the government feeling his energies were not being used. He rejoined the army, though remained an MP, and served for several months on the [[Western Front]]. During this period his second in command was a young [[Archibald Henry Macdonald Sinclair, 1st Viscount Thurso|Archibald Sinclair]] who would later lead the Liberal Party.<br/>+<br/>+In December [[1916]], Asquith fell and was replaced by Lloyd George, however the time was thought to not yet be right to risk the Conservatives' wrath by bringing Churchill back into government. However in July [[1917]] Churchill was appointed [[Minister of Munitions]]. After the ending of the war Churchill served as both [[Secretary of State for War]] and [[Secretary of State for Air]] ([[1919]]-[[1921]]). Churchill suggested chemical weapons be used "against recalcitrant Arabs as an experiment". He said, "I do not understand this squeamishness about the use of gas. We have definitely adopted the position at the Peace Conference of arguing in favour of the retention of gas as a permanent method of warfare. It is sheer affectation to lacerate a man with the poisonous fragment of a bursting shell and to boggle at making his eyes water by means of lachrymatory gas. I am strongly in favour of using poisoned gas against uncivilised tribes. The moral effect should be so good that the loss of life should be reduced to a minimum. It is not necessary to use only the most deadly gasses: gasses can be used which cause great inconvenience and would spread a lively terror and yet would leave no serious permanent effects on most of those affected."<br/>+<br/>+During this time ([[1919]]-[[1921]]), he undertook with surprising zeal the cutting of military expenditure. However, the major preoccupation of his tenure in the War Office was the Allied intervention in the [[Russian Civil War]].Churchill was a staunch advocate of foreign intervention,  declaring that [[Bolshevism]] must be "strangled in its cradle". He secured from a divided and loosely organized Cabinet an intensification and prolongation of the British involvement beyond the wishes of any major group in Parliament or the nation--and in the face of the bitter hostility of labour. In 1920, after the last British forces had been withdrawn, Churchill was instrumental in having arms sent to the Poles when they invaded the Ukraine. He became [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]] 1921 and was a signatory of the Anglo-Irish treaty of [[1921]] which established the [[Irish Free State]]. <br/>+<br/>+In October [[1922]], Churchill underwent an operation to remove his appendix. Upon his return, he learnt that the government had fallen and a [[UK general election, 1922|General Election]] was looming. The Liberal Party was now beset by internal division and Churchill's campaign was weak. He lost his seat at Dundee, quipping that he had lost his ministerial office, his seat and his appendix all at once. The victorious candidates for the two-member seat included the [[Prohibition|Prohibitionist]] [[Edwin Scrymgeour]]. Churchill stood for the Liberals again in the [[UK general election, 1923|1923 general election]], but over the next twelve months he moved towards the Conservative Party, though initially using the labels "Anti-Socialist" and "Constitutionalist". Two years later in the [[UK general election, 1924|General Election of 1924]] he was elected to represent [[Epping]] (where there is now a statue of him) as a "Constitutionalist" with Conservative backing. The following year he formally rejoined the Conservative Party, commenting that, "Anyone can rat [change parties], but it takes a certain ingenuity to rerat."  He was appointed [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in 1924 under [[Stanley Baldwin]] and oversaw the UK's disasterous return to the [[Gold Standard]], which resulted in deflation, unemployment, and the miners' strike that led to the [[UK General Strike 1926|General Strike of 1926]]. During the [[UK General Strike 1926|General Strike of 1926]], Churchill was reported to have suggested that [[machine gun|machine guns]] should be used on the striking miners. Churchill edited the Government's newspaper, the ''[[British Gazette]],'' and during the dispute he argued that "either the country will break the General Strike, or the General Strike will break the country". Furthermore, he was to controversially claim that the [[Fascism]] of [[Benito Mussolini]] had "rendered a service to the whole world", showing as it had "a way to combat subversive forces" &mdash; that is, he considered the regime to be a bulwark against the perceived threat of Communist revolution.<br/>+<br/>+The Conservative government was defeated in the [[UK general election, 1929|1929 General Election]]. In the next two years Churchill became estranged from the Conservative leadership over the issues of protective tariffs and Indian Home Rule. When [[Ramsay MacDonald]] formed the [[National Government]] in [[1931]] Churchill was not invited to join the [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]]. He was now at the lowest point in his career in a period known as 'the wilderness years.' He spent much of the next few years concentrating on his writing, including ''[[A History of the English Speaking Peoples]]'' (which was not published until well after WWII). He became most notable for his outspoken opposition towards the granting of independence to [[India]]. Soon though, his attention was drawn to the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Germany]]'s [[rearmament]]. For a time he was a lone voice calling on Britain to re-arm itself and counter the belligerence of Germany. Churchill was a fierce critic of [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s [[appeasement]] of [[Hitler]]. He was also an outspoken supporter of [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]] during the [[Abdication Crisis of Edward VIII|Abdication Crisis]] leading to some speculation that he might be appointed Prime Minister if the King refused to take Baldwin's advice and consequently the government resigned. However this did not happen and Churchill found himself isolated and in a bruised position for some time after this.<br/>+<br/>+==Role as Wartime Prime Minister==<br/>+<br/>+At the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] Churchill was appointed [[First Lord of the Admiralty]]. On Chamberlain's resignation in May, [[1940]], Churchill was appointed [[Prime Minister]] and formed an all-party government. In response to previous criticisms that there had been no clear single minister in charge of the prosecution of the war, he created and took the additional position of [[Minister of Defence]]. He immediately put his friend and confidant, the industrialist and newspaper baron [[Max Aitken]], (''Lord Beaverbrook'') in charge of aircraft production. It was Aitken's astounding business acumen that allowed Britain to quickly gear up aircraft production and engineering that eventually made the difference in the war.<br/>+<br/>+His speeches at that time were a great inspiration to the embattled United Kingdom.  His famous "I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat" speech was his first as Prime Minister.  He followed that closely, before the [[Battle of Britain]], with "We shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender."<br/>+<br/>+[[Image:Cairo conference.jpg|thumb|left|[[Chiang Kai-shek]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], and Churchill at the [[Cairo Conference]] in [[1943]]]]<br/>+His good relationship with U.S. president [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt]] secured the [[United Kingdom]] vital supplies via the North [[Atlantic Ocean]] shipping routes.  It was for this reason that Churchill was relieved when Roosevelt was re-elected. Upon re-election, Roosevelt immediately set about implementing a new method of not only providing military hardware to Britain without the need for monetary payment, but also of providing, free of fiscal charge, much of the shipping that transported the supplies. Put simply, Roosevelt persuaded congress that repayment for this immensely costly service would take the form of defending the USA; and so [[Lend-lease]] was born. Churchill initiated the [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE),  under [[Hugh Dalton]]'s [[Ministry of Economic Warfare]], which established, conducted and fostered covert, subversive and partisan operations in occupied territories with notable success; and also the [[British Commandos|Commandos]] which established the pattern for most of the world's current [[Special Forces]]. The Russians referred to him as the "British Bulldog".<br/>+<br/>+[[Image:ac.eisenhower2.jpg|thumb|[[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] with Winston Churchill during [[World War II]]]]<br/>+However, some of the military actions during the war remain controversial. Churchill was at best indifferent and perhaps complicit in the [[Great Bengal Famine of 1943]] which took the lives of at least 2.5 million Bengalis.  Japanese troops were threatening British India after having successfully taken neighbouring British Burma.  Some consider the British government's policy of denying effective famine relief a deliberate and callous scorched earth policy adopted in the event of a successful Japanese invasion.  Churchill supported the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing of Dresden]] shortly before the end of the war; Dresden was a mostly civilian target with many refugees from the East and of allegedly little military value.  However, the bombing was helpful to the allied Soviets.<br/>+Churchill was party to treaties that would re-draw post-WWII European and Asian boundaries.  The boundary between [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]] was proposed at the [[Yalta Conference]], as well as the [[expulsion]] of [[Japan]]ese forces from those countries.  Proposals for European boundaries and settlements were discussed as early as [[1943]] by Roosevelt and Churchill; the settlement was officially agreed to by Truman, Churchill, and [[Stalin]] at [[Potsdam Conference|Potsdam]] (Article XIII of the Potsdam protocol). <br/>+One of these settlements was about the borders of Poland, i.e. the boundary between [[Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union]], the so called [[Curzon line]], and between [[Germany]] and [[Poland]], the so called the [[Oder-Neisse line]]. Despite the fact that Poland was the first country that resisted Hitler, Polish borders and government were determined by the Great Powers without asking the voice of the [[Polish government in exile]]. Poles who had fought alongside Britain throughout the war felt betrayed. Churchill himself opposed the effective annexation of Poland by the Soviet Union and wrote bitterly about it in his books, but he was unable to prevent it at the conferences.<br/>+<br/>+[[Image:Chrost.jpg|thumb|left|Churchill, Roosevelt and [[Joseph Stalin]] at the [[Tehran Conference]]]]<br/>+A part of the settlement was an agreement to transfer the remaining citizens of Germany from the area. (Transfer of Poles didn't need to be approved.) The exact numbers and movement of ethnic populations over the Polish-German and Polish-USSR borders in the period at the end of World War II is extremely difficult to determine.  This is not least because, under the Nazi regime, many Poles were replaced in their homes by the conquering Germans in an attempt to consolidate Nazi power.  In the case of the post-WWII settlement, Churchill was convinced that the only way to alleviate tensions between the two populations was the transfer of people, to match the national borders. As Churchill expounded in the House of Commons in 1944, "Expulsion is the method which, in so far as we have been able to see, will be the most satisfactory and lasting. There will be no mixture of populations to cause endless trouble... A clean sweep will be made. I am not alarmed by these transferences, which are more possible in modern conditions." <br/>+<br/>+Although the importance of Churchill's role in World War II was undeniable, he produced many enemies in his own country.  His expressed contempt for ideas such as public health care and for better education for the majority of the population in particular produced much dissatisfaction amongst the population, particularly those who had fought in the war.  Immediately following the close of the war in Europe Churchill was heavily defeated at [[UK 1945 general election|election]] by [[Clement Attlee]] and the [[The Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. <br/>+<br/>+Winston Churchill was an early supporter of the pan-Europeanism that eventually lead to the formation of the European Common market and later the [[European Union]] (for which one of the three main buildings of the European Parliament is named in his honour).  Churchill was also instrumental in giving France a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council (which he supported in order to have another European power to counter-balance the Soviet Union's permanent seat).<br/>+<br/>+At the beginning of the [[Cold War]] he coined the term the "[[Iron Curtain]]," a phrase originally created by [[Joseph Goebbels]]  that entered the public consciousness after a 1946 speech at Westminster College in [[Fulton, Missouri|Fulton]], [[Missouri]] when Churchill famously declared "From [[Stettin]] on the Baltic to [[Trieste]] on the Adriatic, an Iron Curtain has descended across the continent. Behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of Central and [[Eastern Europe]]. [[Warsaw, Poland|Warsaw]], [[Berlin]], [[Prague]], [[Vienna]], [[Budapest]], [[Belgrade]], [[Bucharest]] and [[Sofia]], all these famous cities and the populations around them lie in what I must call the Soviet sphere."<br/>+<br/>+==Second Term==<br/>+[[Image:Church5155.jpg|thumb|Churchill during his second term]]<br/>+Following Labour's defeat in the General Election of 1951, Churchill again became Prime Minister. In [[1953]] he was awarded two major honours. He was [[Knighthood|knighted]] and became Sir Winston Churchill and he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize for Literature]] ''"for his mastery of historical and biographical description as well as for brilliant oratory in defending exalted human values".'' A [[stroke]] in June of that year led to him being paralysed down his left side. He retired because of his health on [[April 5]], [[1955]] but retained his post as Chancellor of the [[University of Bristol]]. During the next few years he revised and finally published [[A History of the English Speaking Peoples]] in four volumes. In [[1956]] he was awarded the [[Karlspreis]] of the city of [[Aachen]] in Germany, for his idea of a "[[United States of Europe]]". In [[1959]] Churchill inherited the title of [[Father of the House]], becoming the MP with the longest continuous service &mdash; since [[1924]]. He was to hold the position until his retirement from the Commons in [[1964]], the position of Father of the House passing to [[Richard Austen Butler]].<br/>+<br/>+==Family==<br/>+On [[September 2]], [[1908]], at the socially desirable [[St. Margaret's, Westminster]], Churchill married [[Clementine Ogilvy Hozier]] ([[April 1]] [[1885]]-[[December 12]] [[1977]]), a dazzling but largely penniless beauty whom he met at a dinner party that March. (He had proposed to actress [[Ethel Barrymore]], but was turned down). They had five children: [[Diana Churchill|Diana]] ([[July 11]] [[1909]]-[[1963]]); [[Randolph Frederick Edward Churchill|Randolph]] ([[May 28]] [[1911]]-[[June 6]] [[1968]]); [[Sarah Millicent Hermione Churchill|Sarah]] ([[October 7]] [[1914]]-[[September 24]] [[1982]], who became an actress, co-starring with [[Fred Astaire]] in the film ''Royal Wedding''); [[Marigold Frances Churchill|Marigold]] ([[November 15]] [[1918]]-[[August 23]] [[1921]], died of diphtheria-like illness); and [[Mary Churchill|Mary]] (b. [[September 15]] [[1922]]), who has written a book on her parents.<br/>+<br/>+Clementine's mother was Lady [[Blanche Henrietta Ogilvy]] ([[1852]]-[[1925]]), second wife of Sir [[Henry Montague Hozier]] and a daughter of the 7th [[Earl of Airlie]]. Clementine's paternity, however, is open to healthy debate. Lady Blanche was well known for sharing her favours and was eventually divorced as a result. She herself maintained that Clementine's biological father was [[Bay Middleton|Capt. William George "Bay" Middleton]], a noted horseman. But Clementine's biographer [[Joan Hardwick]] has surmised, due to Sir Henry Hozier's reputed sterility, that all Lady Blanche's "Hozier" children were actually fathered by her sister's husband, [[Algernon Bertram Freeman-Mitford]] ([[1837]]-[[1916]], better known as a grandfather of the infamous [[Mitford family|Mitford sisters]] of the 1920s).<br/>+<br/>+Churchill's son, Randolph, and grandson, [[Winston Churchill (grandson)|Winston]], both followed him into [[Member of Parliament|Parliament]].<br/>+<br/>+==Last Days==<br/>+On [[January 15]], [[1965]] Churchill suffered another stroke &mdash; a severe cerebral thrombosis &mdash; that left him gravely ill. He died nine days later on [[January 24]], [[1965]]. This was exactly 70 years to the day after his father's death. His body lay in State in [[Westminster Hall]] for three days and a [[State funeral|state funeral]] service was held at [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. This was the first state funeral for a [[commoner]] since that of [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts of Kandahar|Field Marshal Lord Roberts of Kandahar]] in 1914. It was Churchill's wish that, were [[de Gaulle]] to outlive him, his (Churchill's) funeral procession should pass through [[Waterloo station]]. As his coffin passed down the Thames on a boat, the cranes of London's docklands bowed in [[salute]].<br/>+<br/>+At Churchill's request, he was buried in the family plot at Saint Martin's Churchyard, Bladon, near [[Woodstock%2C_England|Woodstock]], [[Oxfordshire]], [[England]].<br/>+<br/>+==Writings==<br/>+Churchill was also a notable historian, producing many works. Some of his twentieth century writings such as '''The World Crisis''' (detailing the First World War) and '''The Second World War''' are highly autobiographical, telling the story of the conflict.<br/>+Initially Churchill used the name '''Winston Churchill''' for his books. However early on he discovered that there was also an American writer of the same name, who had been published first. So as to prevent the two being confused, they agreed that the American would publish as '''Winston Churchill''', and the Englishman as '''Winston Spencer Churchill''' (sometimes abbreviated to '''Winston S Churchill''').<br/>+<br/>+Churchill's works include:<br/>+* ''The River War'' - Published in 1899 (2 vols) Kitchner's reconquest of the Sudan in 1898.

She was a student of [[John Wansbrough]] at [[SOAS]] in [[London]] and has been even more sweeping in her dismissal of Muslim tradition, arguing that even the Qur'an was likely to have been collected later than claimed. She was co-author of the controversial ''[[Hagarism: The Making of the Islamic World]]'', a book that researched the early history of Islam from an archeological point of view.<br/> <br/>-'''.et''' is the [[country code top-level domain]] (ccTLD) for [[Ethiopia]].<br/>+Patricia Crone and her associate Michael Cook,  working at [[SOAS]] at the time, provided an  devastating analysis of early Islamic history by looking at the only surviving contemporary accounts of the Islamic invasion, written in [[Armenian]], [[Greek]], [[Aramaic[[ and [[Syriac]] by [[Middle Eastern]] witnesses to the rise of Islam. They found that Islam, as represented by admittedly biased sources, was in essence a tribal conspiracy against the [[Byzantine]] and [[Persian]] empires with deep roots in [[Judaism]], and that [[Arabs]] and [[Jews]] were allies in these conquering communities. <br/> <br/>-==External links==<br/>-*[http://www.iana.org/root-whois/et.htm IANA .et whois information]<br/>+Apparent support for their conclusions came from finds made during the restoration of the Great Mosque of Sana'a in [[Yemen]], where labourers working in the roof discovered fragments of Qu'rans that are among the oldest in existence. German scholars [[Gerd R. Puin]] who studied the manuscripts discovered that some of the Qu'ranic writing diverges from the authorised version, which by tradition is considered the pure, unadulterated word of [[God]]. What's more, some of the writing appears to have been inscribed over earlier, "rubbed-out" versions of the text. This editing supports the belief of [[John Wansbrough]] and his pupils that the Qu'ran as we know it does not date from the time of Mohammad. <br/> <br/>-{{CcTLD}}<br/>+In ''Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam'', Crone argues that the early Muslim converts turned to Islam because it promised an Arab state based on conquest, rape and pillage. "God could scarcely have been more explicit.

He is currently the starting [[third baseman]] for the [[New York Yankees]], although he began his career as a [[shortstop]]. Rodriguez is widely regarded as one of the best players in [[Major League Baseball]], and is known for signing the largest contract in the sport's history. Is also known for crumbling under the pressure when the game is on the line.<br/> <br/>-'''Rangers Football Club''' is a [[football (soccer)|football]] club from [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]], which plays in the [[Scottish Premier League]].<br/>+==Beginnings==<br/>+Born in the [[Washington Heights]] section of [[New York City]], Rodríguez moved with his parents to their native [[Dominican Republic]] when he was four. After moving to [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], [[Florida]] four years later, Rodriguez's father announced his intention to return to New York for a short time.  His father left without his family and never returned. Rodríguez has said in interviews he can forgive his father for abandoning the family, but that he will never forget.<br/> <br/>-Rangers have won 107 trophies in total, more than any other football club. The club's home is the UEFA five-star, all-seated [[Ibrox Stadium]] in south west [[Glasgow]], which has a capacity of 50,411.<br/>+Rodríguez was a star player at Miami's [[Westminster Christian School | Westminster Christian High School]].  Although he received a baseball scholarship to the [[University of Miami]], Rodríguez never played college baseball, opting instead to become eligible for the amateur draft at the age of 17.  He was drafted first overall by the [[Seattle Mariners]] in [[1993 in sports|1993]].  Rodríguez rose rapidly through the Mariners organization, and made his major league debut in July of [[1994]] at the age of 18.<br/> <br/>-Rangers players today are multi-national, although the club has traditionally been identified with the [[Protestant]] community of Glasgow. For most of its history, Rangers have enjoyed a fierce rivalry with cross-town opponents [[Celtic F.C]]. <br/>+==Early career with the Seattle Mariners==<br/>+Rodríguez's first major league campaign lasted just one month until the season was cut short by the baseball players' strike.  Rodríguez then split most of [[1995 in sports|1995]] between the Mariners and their [[minor league baseball|AAA]] club, the [[Tacoma Rainiers]].  Joining the major league roster permanently in August, Rodriguez got his first taste of postseason play, albeit in just two at-bats.  <br/> <br/>-The club's correct name is simply '''Rangers F.C.''' although it is sometimes incorrectly called '''Glasgow Rangers'''. This frequently happens with [[England|English]] commentators seeking to distinguish between them and other similarly-named clubs, particularly [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.]] <br/>+The following year, Rodríguez took over as the Mariners' regular shortstop and emerged as a star player, hitting 36 home runs, driving in 123 runs, and pacing the [[American League]] with a .358 [[batting average]]. He also led the AL in runs, total bases, and [[double (baseball)|doubles]].  Rodríguez came close to being the youngest MVP in baseball history, falling a mere 3 points short to [[Juan González]] in the voting. <br/> <br/>-The club is nicknamed '''The Teddy Bears''', from the rhyming slang for ''Gers'' (short for ''Rangers''), and the fans are known to each other as '''Bluenoses'''. <br/>+In [[1997 in baseball|1997]], Rodríguez's numbers fell somewhat, as he hit only 23 home runs with 84 RBI and a .300 batting average that year.  Rodríguez rebounded with authority in 1998, howeve, becoming just the third member of the 40 home run/40 [[stolen base]]s [[40-40 Club|club]], with 42 HR and 46 SB. Then, in [[1999 in baseball|1999]], despite missing over 30 games with an injury and playing the second half of the season at [[Safeco Field]] (a considerably less hitter-friendly ballpark than the Kingdome), he matched his previous year's HR total of 42.<br/> <br/>-In 2004 The club launched their own TV Channel, [[Rangers TV|'''Rangers TV''']] Which is operated by [[Setanta Sports]].<br/>+A-Rod entered [[2000 in baseball|2000]] as the cornerstone player of the Mariners franchise, which had recently dealt superstars [[Randy Johnson]] and [[Ken Griffey, Jr.]] Rodriguez put up great numbers as the team's remaining superstar; he hit 41 more home runs with 132 RBI and batted .316. He hit well in the playoffs, too, but Seattle lost to the [[New York Yankees]] in the ALCS despite Rodríguez's .409 average and .773 slugging percentage.<br/>+<br/>+==Texas Rangers==<br/>+Rodríguez became a free agent after the 2000 season; after several playoff disappointments with the Mariners, he declared his intention to go to a World Series-caliber team. Rodríguez's agent [[Scott Boras]] made extravagant demands, reportedly including the use of a private jet. After entertaining offers, Rodríguez signed with the [[Texas Rangers]], who were last in their division in 2000, but had been winners of three of the previous four AL West championships.  A contract was reached which was then the most lucrative contract in sports history: a 10-year deal worth $252 million. (It has since been surpassed by British [[footballer]] [[David Beckham]].)  <br/>+<br/>+Rodríguez's contract is still the most expensive in American sports history.  The deal is worth $63 million more than the second richest baseball deal, the $189 million contract [[Derek Jeter]] signed in February 2001.  Rodríguez earns a total of 87 cents per second, including the offseason.<br/>+<br/>+Rodríguez's hitting numbers only rose in the Texas heat. He hit 52 home runs in [[2001 in baseball|2001]], and followed that with a major league-best 57 home runs in [[2002 in baseball|2002]] (the most ever for a shortstop), while also winning his first [[Gold Glove Award]] for outstanding defense. However, the Rangers finished last in the American League West in both years, a showing that likely cost Rodriguez the MVP award in 2002 when he finished second to fellow shortstop [[Miguel Tejada]], whose 103-win [[Oakland A's]] won the same division.  <br/>+<br/>+Rodriguez's last season with Texas, 2003, was another productive year: he hit .298 with 47 home runs, led the AL in slugging and runs scored, and won his second consecutive [[Gold Glove|Gold Glove Award]].  Following five top-10 finishes in the AL [[Most Valuable Player]] voting between 1996 and 2002, Rodríguez won his first MVP trophy. The Rangers, however remained mired in last place; some laid the blame on Rodríguez's contract, which allegedly monopolized the team's resources, leaving them with little chance to pay other quality players.  Others attributed that same criticism to Ranger owner [[Tom Hicks]]' "buyer's remorse," and general jealousy of the record-setting contract.<br/>+<br/>+Following the 2003 season, Texas set out to move Rodríguez and his expensive contract. The Rangers agreed to a trade with the Boston Red Sox, but the MLBPA vetoed the deal because it called for a voluntary reduction in salary by Rodríguez.  Still a Ranger, and despite the snafu with the Red Sox, the Rangers named him team captain. The situation with Boston also caught the attention of the [[New York Yankees]].<br/>+<br/>+==New York Yankees==<br/>+[[Image:A_Rod_makes_contact.JPG|thumb|left|250px]]<br/>+[[image:Alex Rodriguez, NYY uniform, walking.jpg|thumb|right|190px|Alex Rodriguez taking his position at 3rd base at the beginning of a new inning]]<br/>+On [[February 15]], [[2004]] Rodriguez was successfully traded to the New York Yankees for second baseman [[Alfonso Soriano]] and a player to be named later (Joaquin Arias). The Rangers were obliged to pay $67 million of the $179 million left on Rodriguez's contract.  Although the richest team in the sport, the Yankees had not been assumed to be players in the Rodríguez sweepstakes, since New York already had a star shortstop in team captain [[Derek Jeter]].  However, New York's third baseman, [[Aaron Boone]], suffered a knee injury while playing a game of pickup basketball which sidelined him for the entire 2004 season. Rodríguez agreed to switch positions from shortstop to third base, paving the way for the trade. Rodríguez also had to switch uniform numbers, from 3 to 13; he'd worn 3 his entire career but the number is retired by the Yankees in honor of [[Babe Ruth]].<br/>+<br/>+In his first season with the Yankees, Rodríguez's numbers dippes slightly from his numbers with Texas.  He hit .286 with 36 home runs and 106 [[run batted in|runs batted in]], his seventh consecutive season with at least 100 RBI. He finished 14th in balloting for the [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|American League MVP Award]].  Near the end of the season, Yankees manager [[Joe Torre]] moved Rodriguez to the No. 2 spot in the batting order.<br/>+<br/>+In the 2004 ALDS, Rodríguez was a dominant hitter against the [[Minnesota Twins]], batting .421 and slugging .737.  Following the series win, Rodríguez's first season in pinstripes had culminated in a dramatic playoff series against the team he had almost ended up playing for: the Yankees' bitter rival, the [[Boston Red Sox]].  <br/>+<br/>+One of the most talked-about plays of A-Rod's career caused controversy late in Game 6 of the [[2004 American League Championship Series]].  With one out and [[Derek Jeter]] on first base in the bottom of the 8th inning, Rodríguez hit a slow roller between the pitcher's mound and the first base bag.  Red Sox [[pitcher]] [[Bronson Arroyo]] fielded the ball and ran towards Rodríguez to apply a tag.  As Arroyo reached towards him, Rodriguez slapped the ball out of Arroyo's glove.  As the ball rolled loose, Jeter scored all the way from first as Rodríguez reached second on the play, which was initially ruled an error on Arroyo.  However, the other umpires quickly huddled, then ruled that Rodríguez was out for interfering.  Jeter was sent back to first base, his run nullified.  The Red Sox were able to escape the inning with no further damage and eventually won the game 4-2, tying the series at 3 game apiece.  (Boston went on to win Game Seven, and subsequently, the [[World Series]].)  <br/>+<br/>+In 2005, his second season with the Yankees, Rodríguez's numbers improved, as he hit .321 with 48 home runs and 130 RBI.  An offensive highlight of his season came on April 26, when Rodríguez hit 3 home runs off Angels' pitcher [[Bartolo Colon]] and drove in 10 RBI.  Rodríguez also set several marks for power during the 2005 season.   On June 8, he hit his 400th career home run, becoming the youngest player in major league history to do so.  (Rodríguez was 29 years and 316 days old; [[Ken Griffey Jr.|Ken Griffey, Jr.]], the previous record holder, reached 400 home runs at 30 years, 141 days.)  Rodríguez also became the Yankee righthanded hitter with the most home runs in a season, supplanting [[Joe DiMaggio]] and [[Gary Sheffield]].  His 48th and final home run tied him for the most homers by a third baseman (along with [[Mike Schmidt]] and [[Adrian Beltre]]).  Rodríguez now holds the records for most HRs in a single season at two positions, shortstop and third base, becoming the only major leaguer ever to accomplish this feat.  2005 also marked then tenth straight season that Rodríguez scored at least 100 runs.<br/>+<br/>+Rodríguez beat out Boston's [[David Ortiz]] for his second American League MVP Award in three seasons.  He became the fifth player to win MVP awards with two different teams, joining [[Mickey Cochrane]], [[Jimmie Foxx]], [[Frank Robinson]] and [[Barry Bonds]].  Rodríguez was also named the shortstop on the Major League Baseball [[Latino Legends Team]].  However, Rodríguez bat .133 without an RBI as the Yankees lost in the [[Division Series]] to the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]].  <br/>+<br/>+For some, Rodríguez has acquired a reputation as a poor performer in the "big game" or the "clutch"-- this, despite several dominant postseason performances.  Several factors have played a role in this perception.  The [[Seattle Mariners]]' team record improved from 91 wins to an AL-record 116 the year following his departure.  The [[Texas Rangers]] also moved up 18 games in the standings one year after trading away Rodríguez.  The 2004 ALCS, in which the Red Sox famously came from being down 3-0 to winning in seven was the hugest debacle in Yankees history, and Rodríguez was that team's newest addition.  The following year, [[David Ortiz]] recorded several game-tying or game-winning hits, and the drama of his performance was contrasted with Rodríguez's heftier, but less theatrical statistics.  Some fans took to calling the third baseman "A-Fraud."<br/>+<br/>+In May 2006, Rodríguez finally responded to the criticism: "I could care less.  In my career, I've been hearing it for a long time.  It will never stop until you win five or six World Series in a row, and hit a [[Joe Carter]] home run. I've done a lot of special things in this game, and for none of that to be considered clutch, it's an injustice.  I don't take anything personally; I enjoy it, it motivates me and I think it's comical.  I think (for) anyone that drives in over 130 runs numerous times in his career, it's impossible not to be clutch."<br/>+<br/>+The debate has reached the level where there is now a backlash against the backlash.  ESPN's D.J. Gallo wrote a sarcastic daily diary, blasting Rodríguez's series of "embarrassing performances"<ref>http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=gallo/060530&lpos=spotlight&lid=tab1pos1</ref>:<br/>+<br/>+<blockquote><br/>+*Wednesday at Boston: The Yankees won 8-6, but A-Rod got only one hit and scored just a single run. But that's not even the worst part. In the second inning, following a David Ortiz strikeout, Manny Ramirez hit a home run to left. Then the next batter, Jason Varitek, grounded out to A-Rod at third. I mean, come on A-Rod! Now you make the play?! The batter before hits a home run over your head to cut your team's lead to two and you do nothing, and then Varitek hits a weak grounder to you and you make that out? How about jumping up and snagging that Ramirez shot before it rocketed over your head? That's what your team needed! I mean, I don't know -- if I'm going to pay a guy $25 million to play third, I expect him to make those plays. I can get anyone to field routine ground balls.<br/>+<br/>+*Thursday, no game: A scheduled off day. Typical A-Fraud -- the Yankees manage to win back-to-back games against the Red Sox and he needs a day off. Pathetic.<br/>+</blockquote> <br/>+On July 27, 2005,  Rodríguez turned 30 years old.  Through age 29, Rodriguez had more home runs, more runs batted in, more runs scored, and more base hits than all-time leaders [[Hank Aaron]] (HR and RBI), [[Rickey Henderson]] (runs), and [[Pete Rose]] (hits) did in their twenties.<br/>+<br/>+==Playing style==<br/>+Rodriguez is often referred to as being as close to "perfection" as a player can get; he hits for both power and average, has above-average speed, and both his swing and defensive play are both known for their fundamental soundness. <ref>http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCI/is_7_62/ai_102520516</ref> In the field, he has made a remarkable transition from the shortstop position to third base, with almost no drop-off in either  range or accuracy. <br/>+<br/>+==Miscellaneous==<br/>+* In 2003, Alex Rodriguez gave $3.9 million to the [[University of Miami]] to renovate its baseball stadium. The new facility will be named 'Mark Light Field at Alex Rodriguez Park.'  Rodriguez had signed a letter of intent to play baseball for Miami, but later opted to sign with the Seattle Mariners.  Rodriguez, who was also recruited by the university to play quarterback for its football team, remains an ardent Miami Hurricanes fan and can frequently be found at Hurricane sporting events, as well as working out at the school's athletic facilities in the off-season.<br/>+* He married the former Cynthia Scurtis on [[November 2]], [[2002]]. The couple's first child, Natasha Alexander, was born on [[November 18]], [[2004]].<br/>+* After vacillating between playing for the Dominican Republic and the United States, Rodriguez, on [[January 17]], [[2006]], declared his intention to play for the U.S. in the [[World Baseball Classic]]. <ref>http://www.newsday.com/sports/baseball/ny-spbase0118,0,6309821.story?coll=ny-top-headlines</ref><br/>+<br/>+==External links==<br/>+{{wikiquote}}<br/>+<br/>+* [http://arod.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/players/rodriguez_alex/index.jsp AROD.com] - Alex Rodriguez's official website<br/>+* [http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/team/player.jsp?player_id=121347 Player Information] from Yankees.com<br/>+*{{espn mlb|id=5275|name=Alex Rodriguez}}<br/>+*{{baseball-reference|id=r/rodrial01}}<br/>+* [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0735710/ Alex Rodriguez] at [[The Internet Movie Database]]<br/>+<br/>+{{start box}}<br/>+{{succession box | title= First overall pick in the [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] [[MLB Draft|Entry Draft]] | before= [[Phil Nevin]] | years=[[1993 in baseball|1993]]| after=[[Paul Wilson (baseball player)|Paul Wilson]]}}<br/>+{{succession box | before = [[Miguel Tejada]] | title = [[MLB Most Valuable Player award|American League Most Valuable Player]]| years = [[2003 in baseball|2003]] | after = [[Vladimir Guerrero]]}}<br/>+{{succession box | before = [[Vladimir Guerrero]] | title = [[MLB Most Valuable Player award|American League Most Valuable Player]]| years = [[2005 in baseball|2005]] | after = incumbent}}<br/>+{{end box}}<br/>+<br/>+[[Category:Major league players from New York|Rodriguez, Alex]]<br/>+[[Category:1996 American League All-Stars|Rodriguez, Alex]]<br/>+[[Category:1997 American League All-Stars|Rodriguez, Alex]]<br/>+[[Category:1998 American League All-Stars|Rodriguez, Alex]]<br/>+[[Category:2000 American League All-Stars|Rodriguez, Alex]]<br/>+[[Category:2001 American League All-Stars|Rodriguez, Alex]]<br/>+[[Category:2002 American League All-Stars|Rodriguez, Alex]]<br/>+[[Category:2003 American League All-Stars|Rodriguez, Alex]]<br/>+[[Category:2004 American League All-Stars|Rodriguez, Alex]]<br/>+[[Category:2005 American League All-Stars|Rodriguez, Alex]]<br/>+[[Category:New York Yankees players|Rodriguez, Alex]]<br/>+[[Category:Seattle Mariners players|Rodriguez, Alex]]<br/>+[[Category:Texas Rangers players|Rodriguez, Alex]]<br/>+[[Category:Major league shortstops|Rodriguez, Alex]]<br/>+[[Category:Major league third basemen|Rodriguez, Alex]]<br/>+[[Category:2006 World Baseball Classic players of the United States|Rodriguez, Alex]]<br/>+[[Category:Gold Glove Award winners|Rodriguez, Alex]]<br/>+[[Category:30-30 club|Rodriguez, Alex]]<br/>+[[Category:Boys & Girls Club alumni|Rodriguez, Alex]]<br/>+[[Category:People from New York City|Rodriguez, Alex]]<br/>+[[Category:1975 births|Rodriguez, Alex]]<br/>+[[Category:Living people|Rodriguez, Alex]]<br/> <br/> <br/>-==History== <br/>-{{main|History of Rangers F.C.}}<br/>-<br/>-==The Old Firm and sectarianism== <br/>-The term [[sectarian]] refers to a group who belongs to a religious and cultural [[sect]], and display contempt, hatred or dislike of all others, not belonging to their sect. <br/>-<br/>-In the context of [[Scottish football]], sectarianism is beyond the control of any individual club - it is a much wider issue, rooted in [[social]], [[cultural]], [[historical]] and [[religious]] circumstances. Nevertheless, both Rangers and Celtic accept that they have a problem with sectarianism and [[sectarian violence]]. Both clubs admit that a proportion of their supporters have been, and continue to be, guilty of perpetuating sectarian and partisan beliefs as well as cultural intolerance. <br/>-<br/>-In recent times, both Rangers and Celtic have taken measures to combat sectarianism. Working alongside the [[Scottish Parliament]], [[church]] groups, schools and community organisations, the Old Firm has made efforts to clamp down on sectarian songs, inflammatory flag-waving, and troublesome supporters, using increased levels of policing and surveillance.[http://www.sundayherald.com/49302 Glasgow Herald]<br/>-<br/>-On [[12 April]] [[2006]], following an investigation into the conduct of Rangers supporters at both legs of their [[UEFA Champions League]] tie against [[Villarreal CF]], the Control and Disciplinary Body of [[UEFA]] declared the Rangers fans not guilty of alleged discriminatory chants. [http://www.uefa.com/uefa/Keytopics/kind=512/newsId=413276.html]. [[UEFA]] challenged the ruling, and UEFA's Appeals Body partially upheld the appeal[http://www.uefa.com/uefa/Keytopics/kind=512/newsId=424237.html], fining the Ibrox club £13,500, and warning the club as to their responsibility for any future misconduct by their fans in relation to sectarian and discriminatory behaviour [http://www.uefa.com/uefa/Keytopics/kind=512/newsId=424237.html].<br/>-<br/>-==Under Alex McLeish==<br/>-Alex McLeish's four-and-a-half-year spell at Ibrox was a turbulent one, coming as it did after the wastefulness of the [[Dick Advocaat|Advocaat]] era.  McLeish never enjoyed access to the funds his predecessors had been given, and his managership was marked by wildly-fluctuating fortunes, in part caused by forced asset stripping of his best players due to the spectre of debt from Advocaat's spending.  <br/>-<br/>-His appointment in December 2001 (see [http://newswww.bbc.net.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/1701609.stm]) was met with a lukewarm reaction amongst many Rangers supporters.  <br/>-<br/>-Some viewed it as symptomatic of the downsizing of the club's ambitions, while others saw in McLeish a manager whose mixed fortunes at [[Hibernian F.C.]] and [[Motherwell F.C.]] left him ill-equipped to cope with the demands of managing a high-profile club like Rangers.<br/>-<br/>-A few, perhaps remembering McLeish's days as centre-half colossus in [[Alex Ferguson]]'s successful Aberdeen side of the early 1980s, questioned whether someone lacking any obvious Rangers allegiance could revitalise a club faced, for the first time in decades, with a concerted challenge from a seemingly rejuvenated [[Celtic F.C.]] <br/>-<br/>-Such concerns were quickly allayed, however, as McLeish's Rangers began to display a spirit that had been sorely lacking in Advocaat's final seasons.  Cup successes in McLeish's first half-season, 2001/2, saw a renewed sense of optimism that Rangers could regain the ascendancy claimed by Celtic under the managership of [[Martin O'Neill]].  <br/>-<br/>-A 3-2 defeat of Celtic in the season's climactic Scottish Cup final (see [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scottish_cup/1966673.stm]), orchestrated by Barry Ferguson and marked by a dramatic last minute winner, reinforced the view that Rangers could once more gain the pre-eminence enjoyed for almost all of the period since Graeme Souness's appointment as manager in 1986.  <br/>-<br/>-His first full season as manager, 2002/3, saw the club fulfil this sense of promise, and featured an astonishingly tense run-in to the league campaign that many thought could never be repeated - until two years later.<br/>-<br/>-Another victory over [[Celtic F.C.]], this time in the League Cup (see [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_div_1/2853133.stm]),provided the first leg of the club's latest treble. Rangers' half-century of championships was secured on a dramatic last day of the league season, with victory over Dunfermline denying Celtic the title on goal difference (see [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/2936822.stm]).<br/>-<br/>-The destination of the title was unknown until the dying seconds of this match as both teams had headed into the game level on points and goal difference. Only a last-minute penalty by [[Mikel Arteta]] clinched the win. A somewhat drab and anti-climactic 1-0 victory over Dundee in the Scottish Cup final the following week saw a triumphant finalé to the season (see [http://newswww.bbc.net.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_div_1/2946904.stm]) and a near-flawless start to McLeish's reign, ruined only by a poor showing in Europe, which Rangers exited in the first round to minnows [[FK Viktoria Žižkov|Viktoria Žižkov]].    <br/>-<br/>-Yet the overall success of McLeish's initial period as manager proved difficult to sustain. The club's parlous financial position, in the wake of the profligacy of the Advocaat era, meant a period of relative austerity.  <br/>-<br/>-Wage bills were slashed as the club embarked on an extensive cost-cutting programme in an attempt to stabilise a mushrooming (and unsustainable) debt. Confronted with a squad of well-paid but ageing players largely assembled by Advocaat, McLeish was compelled to rebuild without the luxury of the generous transfer kitty enjoyed by his predecessors over the preceding two decades, and lost from his treble winning team the inspirational but mistake-prone [[Lorenzo Amoruso]], Scottish international winger [[Neil McCann]] and, most damagingly of all, club captain [[Barry Ferguson]] to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.]]<br/>-<br/>-To replace these players, McLeish was required to rebuild, not through the high-profile and often audacious signings of the Souness, Smith and Advocaat years, but via wheeling and dealing and the selective use of 'Bosman' free transfers.  <br/>-<br/>-After a good start to 2003/2004 which saw the team lead the [[SPL]] and qualify for the money-spinning [[European Champions League|Champions League]] (with another dramatic late goal in Denmark against [[FC Copenhagen]]), the loss of Ferguson shortly afterwards led to a dramatic downturn in results and a trophyless campaign.  McLeish's Bosman signings of experienced players, such as the Brazilian midfielder [[Emerson Moisés Costa|Emerson]] and Norwegian forward [[Egil Ostenstad]] have since entered Ibrox folklore as some of the worst players to pull on a Rangers shirt.  Most damaging of all, however, was the £600,000 signing of Portuguese winger [[Nuno Capucho]]. <br/>-<br/>-The 2004/2005 season started in the same vein, with McLeish making another poor signing in Serbian midfielder, [[Dragan Mladenovic]], for £1m. The Serb would manage less than ten games for the club.  <br/>-<br/>-On the pitch, the team again fell behind Celtic in the league and exited the Champions League at the qualifying stage. It was rumoured that failure to gain entry into the new [[UEFA Cup]] group stage would see McLeish lose his job, but another late goal and a penalty shoot out win over [[CS Marítimo]] of Portugal provided him with a stay of execution.<br/>-<br/>-After this, his fortunes began to turn again.  Mladenovic aside, McLeish had made some canny signings in the summer, such as [[Nacho Novo]], plus the Bosmans [[Dado Pršo]], [[Jean-Alain Boumsong]] along with teak-tough midfielder and Rangers die-hard [[Alex Rae]].  Once these players settled in, the team began to recover ground on O'Neill's ageing Celtic side.<br/>-<br/>-Boumsong, in particular, was a great success but he was to be sold in January 2005, after only six months at the club, to English Premiership side [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] (managed by former boss [[Graeme Souness]]) for £8m.  <br/>-<br/>-This cash paved the way for more signings, including [[Thomas Buffel]] and the return of former captain and prodigal son [[Barry Ferguson]].<br/>-<br/>-Another trophy, the [[Scottish League Cup]], was procured in March 2005 after a 5-1 victory over Motherwell (see [http://newswww.bbc.net.uk/sport2/hi/football/scot_div_1/4359199.stm]). <br/>-<br/>-The league, however, appeared to have been lost. Despite catching and overtaking Celtic (two Old Firm wins, including a pivotal 2-0 victory at Parkhead - McLeish's first win there as Ibrox manager) nerves seemed to get the better of Rangers once they had got on top.  <br/>-<br/>-A loss to Celtic in the last derby of the season handed a five-point lead to their rivals with only four games of the season remaining, and seemed to end McLeish's hopes of a second league title.<br/>-<br/>-However, the Ibrox team managed to win the league title on the last day of the season.  A 3-1 Celtic home loss to Hibernian the week after the derby meant only two points separated the sides going into the final game of the season, at which point Rangers needed to win at Hibernian and hope that Celtic would drop points at Fir Park.  In perhaps even more dramatic circumstances than two years previously (see [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/scot_prem/4565709.stm]), [[Motherwell F.C.]] overcame a 1-0 deficit with two goals in injury time to defeat the Parkhead side, while Rangers edged out a tight 1-0 win at Easter Road.  <br/>-<br/>-For 89 minutes of the match, Rangers thought their rivals were set for the title, and once news broke of Motherwell's late intervention, ecstasy awaited for the Ibrox legions.  Even the helicopter that was carrying the league trophy was on its way to Fir Park to present it to Celtic when it had to turn around and fly to Easter Road. That day has passed into Ibrox folklore, becoming known as 'Helicopter Sunday'.  McLeish could celebrate his second, and Rangers' 51st, league title.<br/>-<br/>-Season 2005/2006 got off to a bad start, with Rangers only winning six league games out of the first 17, being knocked out of the League Cup by Celtic in the process. The period from October through to early December saw the team embark on statistically the worst run in their history, going ten games without a win.  <br/>-<br/>-During this time, however, the club became the first Scottish side to qualify for the knockout stages of the Champions League, yet there was still significant pressure on McLeish from fans due to the club's poor position in the domestic league table. It was widely felt - and publicised - that chairman [[David Murray]] would let McLeish go after the European campaign had finished, and a press conference arranged two days after the final group match seemed to confirm this. <br/>-<br/>-However, Murray seemed to undergo a change of heart and stated that McLeish would remain in charge indefinitely (see [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/4503564.stm]), but did concede that domestic results would need to improve. Rumours continued to suggest that this was because his favoured target, Frenchman [[Paul Le Guen]], was unwilling to take charge until the summer.<br/>-<br/>-After this announcement, the team improved, helped by the signing from Kilmarnock of the young Scot and SPL top scorer [[Kris Boyd]]. The side strung together a ten-match unbeaten run. Yet, entering the crucial month of February, which was to feature a must-win Old Firm match and the resumption of European football, this evaporated.<br/>-<br/>-Rangers lost 3-0 at home to [[Hibernian F.C.]] on [[4 February]], [[2006]] to go out of the [[Scottish Cup]] and end their last realistic hopes of silverware for the season. Protests against McLeish and the chairman who had kept him on followed the game, and four days later they were humbled in a 2-0 defeat at McLeish's old club, [[Aberdeen F.C.]]  <br/>-<br/>-After signs that supporter unrest was turning on Murray, on [[9 February]], [[2006]], two days before the crucial Old Firm match, it was announced that Alex McLeish would leave his position as manager at the end of the 2005-06 season (see [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/4697444.stm]), and on [[11 March]], the worst-kept secret in Scottish football was confirmed with the news that former [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] manager [[Paul Le Guen]] would indeed succeed him at the end of the season (see [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/4791030.stm]). <br/>-<br/>-It was also announced that the Frenchman would be given significant funds with which to strengthen the squad, with Rangers having announced a £48m tie-up with sports retailer [[JJB Sports]].<br/>-<br/>-Paul Le Guen has a good track record. At Lyon he signed the likes of [[Juninho Pernambucano]].<br/>- <br/>-Overall, the McLeish era was mixed. Results swung violently from one season to the next, while his record in the transfer market was also inconsistent.  <br/>-<br/>-The lack of money certainly played its part in McLeish's downfall (he brought in around £13 million in transfer fees overall and the Ibrox wage bill was slashed too) but it is debatable, based on the money he did have to spend, whether greater sums would have been invested wisely. Indeed some supporters of the Ibrox club claim a good proportion of McLeish's signings have been among the worst in the club's entire history. At a time when Scottish talent was apparently beginning to emerge again, some fans found it puzzling that McLeish failed to make more of an effort to raid markets closer to home, or to develop youth players. However, others pointed out that he signed the likes of Novo, Andrews and Murray from other Scottish teams and youngsters such as Chris Burke, Alan Hutton, Ross McCormack and Steven Smith emerged from within the club.<br/>-<br/>-McLeish obtained seven domestic trophies in four years, equalling the record of his initial Old Firm counterpart [[Martin O'Neill]].<br/>-<br/>-==A new era==<br/>-[[Paul Le Guen]] became manager after season 2005-06.  Known for unearthing and nurturing young talent, Le Guen made an immediate splash in the transfer market signing South African U18 Dean Furman from [[Chelsea F.C.]], and William Stanger and Antoine Ponroy from [[Stade Rennais FC|Rennes]].  While allowing Ibrox favorite [[Alex Rae]] to move to a new career as player-manager of [[Dundee F.C.]], he has also signed [[Libor Sionko]] and [[Karle Svensson]], both heading to the [[FIFA World Cup 2006|World Cup]] with their nations.  Rangers' first match under Le Guen will be a friendly against Irish League Champions [[Linfield F.C.]] on [[7 July]] [[2006]] at [[Windsor Park]], [[Belfast]].<br/>-<br/>-==Famous players==<br/>-Famous present or former players at Ibrox include:<br/>-<br/>-{|-table style="width: 100%; text-align: left;" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"<br/>-|valign="top"|<br/>-*[[Moses McNeil]]¹<br/>-*[[Alan Morton]]¹<br/>-*[[Robert Smith McColl]]<br/>-*[[Sam English]]<br/>-*[[David Meiklejohn]]¹<br/>-*[[Bob McPhail]]¹<br/>-*[[Jock Shaw]]¹<br/>-*[[Jim Baxter]]¹<br/>-*[[Willie Waddell]]¹<br/>-*[[Gordon Ramsay]]<br/>-*[[Sandy Jardine]]¹<br/>-*[[Derek Johnstone]]¹<br/>-*[[David Cooper (footballer)|Davie Cooper]]¹<br/>-*[[Graeme Souness]]¹<br/>-*[[Terry Butcher]]¹<br/>-*[[Ray Wilkins]]¹<br/>-*[[Willie Henderson]]¹ <br/>-*[[Richard Gough (soccer)|Richard Gough]]¹<br/>-*[[Mark Hateley]]¹<br/>-|valign="top"|<br/>-*[[Alexei Mikhailichenko]]<br/>-*[[Ally McCoist]]¹<br/>-*[[Andy Goram]]¹<br/>-*[[Brian Laudrup]]¹<br/>-*[[Paul Gascoigne]]¹<br/>-*[[Craig Moore]]<br/>-*[[Jorg Albertz]]¹<br/>-*[[Lorenzo Amoruso]]<br/>-*[[Arthur Numan]]<br/>-*[[Claudio Caniggia]]<br/>-*[[Andrei Kanchelskis]]<br/>-*[[Claudio Reyna]]<br/>-*[[Ronald de Boer]]<br/>-*[[Tore Andre Flo]]<br/>-*[[Frank de Boer]]<br/>-*[[Dado Pršo]]²<br/>-*[[Thomas Buffel]]²<br/>-*[[Stefan Klos]]²<br/>-*[[Barry Ferguson]]¹ ²<br/>-|}<br/>-<br/>-'''¹''' - Player is included in the [[Rangers F.C.

From LBJ using them to monitor activity leading up to the 1968 Democratic Convention as a political tool against RFK, to J. Edgar Hoover sending wiretap tapes to Martin Luther King and suggesting he commit suicide, to the famous cable splice connecting all traffic in the telephone exchange of Congress to an FBI safe house where it was monitored, to Richard Nixon, dirty business with wiretaps has been a recurrent violation by the exective branch.

The unwillingness of the government to permit any new telecom medium to exist where people can communicate without a backdoor the government can listen at coupled with the assertion that they are entitled to have the same wiretap access as they had in the previous medium as a right has drawn controversy, as the wiretap access they had in the past is held by many to be just the kind of intrusive government procedure the Fourth Amendment was targeted to prevent.<br/>+<br/>+== Legal analysis' "statutory exemption" paragraph ==<br/>+<br/>+I'm looking at recent changes to the legal analysis of AUMF as statutory authorization under FISA.  Let's be clear here, there are two ways to use AUMF under FISA.  First, it could be understood as a declaration of war for purposes of 50 U.S.C. &sect;1811.  In this case, you get into the semi-ambiguous language which permits the president to "authorize electronic surveillance without a court order under this subchapter to acquire foreign intelligence information for a period not to exceed fifteen calendar days following a declaration of war by the Congress".  I take it that the person that made the change read this to mean "in the 15 days following a declaration of war the president may authorize indefinite surveillance".  That may be one interpretation.  The other way to read it is, "after a declaration of war, a president can authorize surveillance for periods not to exceed 15 days". Either interpretation seems to work.<br/>+<br/>+Second, as I originally intended the paragraph and the interpretation relied upon by the administration, AUMF may provide an out from criminal and civil liability under 50 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1809 and 1810.  Under those provisions (and the analogous ones for physical searches), there is no liability if the actions were "authorized by statute".  AUMF may be such statutory authorization.<br/>+<br/>+I am going to revert the paragraph tomorrow morning if no one objects.  As it is now, I'm not even sure that it gets the law correct. <span style="color:#996">mmm</span><span style="color:#963">beer</span><sup>[[User_Talk:Mmmbeer|T]] / [[Special:Contributions/Mmmbeer|C]] / [[User:Mmmbeer|?]]</sup> 03:59, 30 December 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+Regarding the 15 day exemption in 1811, the interpretation that it means "in the 15 days following a declaration of war the president may authorize indefinite surveillance" is not supported by the legislative history. Neither is "after a declaration of war, a president can authorize surveillance for periods not to exceed 15 days".  Rather, the legislative history shows that it was designed to  “allow time for consideration of any amendment to [FISA] that may be appropriate during a wartime emergency.”  The following is footnote 91 of the Congressional Research Service memo, on the legislative history:<br/>+<br/>+<blockquote>This provision originated in the House version of the bill, which would have allowed the President to authorize electronic surveillance for periods up to a year during time of war declared by Congress. The conference substituted a compromise provision authorizing electronic surveillance without a court order to acquire foreign intelligence information for 15 days following a declaration of war. H.R. CONF.  REP.  NO. 95-1720, at 34 (1978).  The 15-day period was intended to “allow time for consideration of any amendment to [FISA] that may be appropriate during a wartime emergency.” Id.  The conferees also expressed their intent that “all other provisions of this act not pertaining to the court order requirement shall remain in effect during this period.” </blockquote><br/>+<br/>+Moreover, the Administration (as reflected in the DOJ letter) did not advance the two interpretations discussed here, and a Jan 9 letter from 14 highly respected law professors and former government lawyers interpret Section 1811 to mean "the law limits warrantless wiretapping to the first fifteen days of the conflict."

The problem, I suggest, is that much of the article concerns a legal analysis of what happened, but such is inherently speculative. Until the various issues go before an actual US court and the various legal arguments are tested, it is difficult to say anything verifiable that isn't just "one analysis says this..." and "one analysis says that...". Those analyses are obviously politically sensitive. So, what is the best way of handling the uncertainty?

[[User:Bondegezou|Bondegezou]] 17:17, 31 December 2005 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::Part of the problem is that this is still fresh news, and the problem with the media lately is that they run to press so quickly before the issues are fully vetted and we only get skin-deep details.  For instance, this only monitored calls for data-mining that either came from overseas or went overseas (with an emphasis on Afghanistan).  Much of the public debate seems to miss that point.  Some of this has been tested in court, to a degree.  Before FISA, '''appeals''' courts held that the President can do warrantless searches in the case of agents of foreign powers ''only''.  Does that apply to this situation?  Maybe.  It's hardly as nefarious as it is presented because it is subject of intelligent debate.  However the media has a vested interest in conflict.

General Hayden revealed that the surveillance program had been successful in circumstances where FISA was deemed inadequate:<br/>+<br/>+:Q Have you identified armed enemy combatants, through this program, in the United States?<br/>+<br/>+:GENERAL HAYDEN: This program has been successful in detecting and preventing attacks inside the United States.<br/>+<br/>+:Q General Hayden, I know you're not going to talk about specifics about that, and you say it's been successful. But would it have been as successful -- can you unequivocally say that something has been stopped or there was an imminent attack or you got information through this that you could not have gotten through going to the court?<br/>+<br/>+:GENERAL HAYDEN: I can say unequivocally, all right, that we have got information through this program that would not otherwise have been available.<br/>+<br/>+:Q Through the court? Because of the speed that you got it?<br/>+<br/>+:GENERAL HAYDEN: Yes, because of the speed, because of the procedures, because of the processes and requirements set up in the FISA process, I can say unequivocally that we have used this program in lieu of that and this program has been successful.<br/>+<br/>+Gen. Hayden also commented on the provisions in FISA allowing for emergency authorization by the Attorney General prior to obtaining a warrant. He stated that even an emergency authorization under FISA required marshaling arguments and "looping paperwork around". He implied that the decisions on whom to intercept were being made in real time or near real time by a shift supervisor and another person, but refused to discuss details of the requirement for speed.<br/> <br/> ----<br/>-<br/>-A '''vortex''' is a spinning [[turbulent flow]] (or any spiral whirling motion) with closed streamlines. The shape of media or mass rotating rapidly around a center forms a vortex. It is a flow involving rotation about an axis (not always oriented vertically though; sometimes possessing a horizontal axis). <br/>-<br/>-== Observations ==<br/>-<br/>-A vortex can be seen in the spiraling [[motion]] of [[air]] or [[liquid]] around a [[center]] of [[rotation]]. [[Circular]] current of [[water]] of conflicting [[tide]]s form vortex shapes. [[Turbulent flow]] makes many vortices.  A good example of a vortex is the [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] [[phenomenon]] of a [[whirlwind]] or a [[tornado]]. This whirling air mass mostly takes the form of a [[column]] or [[spiral]]. Tornadoes develop from severe thunderstorms, usually spawned from [[squall line]]s and [[supercell thunderstorm]]s, though they sometimes happen as a result of a [[hurricane]].<br/>-<br/>-A vortex can be any circular or rotary flow in the atmosphere that possesses vorticity.<sub><small>[1]</small></sub> A ''mesovortex'' is on the scale of a few [[mile]]s (smaller than a hurricane but larger than a tornado). <sub><small>[2]</small></sub> On a much smaller scale, a vortex is usually formed as water goes down a drain, as in a [[sink]] or a [[toilet]]. This occurs in water as the revolving mass forms a [[whirlpool]]. This whirlpool is caused by water flowing out of a small opening in the bottom of a [[basin]] or [[reservoir]]. This swirling flow structure within a region of fluid flow opens downward from the water [[surface]].<br/>-<br/>-== Instances ==<br/>-<br/>-* [[Lift-induced drag]] of a [[wing]] on an [[aircraft]]<br/>-* The primary cause of [[drag]] in the [[sail]] of a [[sloop]]<br/>-* [[Sunspot]]<br/>-* [[Tornado]]<br/>-* [[Whirlpool]]<br/>-<br/>-== See also ==<br/>-<br/>-* [[Strouhal number]]<br/>-* [[Shower-curtain effect]]<br/>-* [[Eddy]]<br/>-* [[Viktor Schauberger]]<br/>-<br/>-==References==<br/>-<br/>-# "''[http://oap2.weather.com/glossary/v.html Weather Glossary]''"' The Weather Channel Interactive, Inc.. 2004.<br/>-# "''[http://www.bbsr.edu/rpi/meetpart/paper/glossary.html Glossary and Abbreviations]''".

This whole thing is 39KB and growing -- too long. Is there a very good reason why you can not find out what you want to know and tighten the Dec. 16th section of this NYT section? While you're finding out who said the NYT broke the law, you might want to think about how to shrink and restructure the entire article - not such a trivial matter. For instance, Gonzales has stated the reason why Congress wasn't asked to amend the FISA - it wouldn't have done it - but this is lost in a footnote, whereas it should be in the Hayden-Gonzales press conference section.

I don't have all the sources memorized, but you'll find plenty, both here and on various other web pages to document that other Administrations have exercised this power...from Reagan's to Clinton's.  In fact some were more nefarious and egregious that what is currently being talked about.  See, for example, President Clinton's use of Echelon in spying on right wing militia groups (both before and after Oklahoma City).  I'm not advocating whether it is right or wrong (or constitutional or unconstitutional, for that matter), I'm just saying we need to stop pretending like this is something new.  As long as the use of these tactics are necessitated by National Security, it falls within the pervue of Article II Presidential Powers.  (I mean, come on, the President, in his role as Commander in Chief, can legally track down and KILL terrorists across the globe, but he can't listen in on their phone calls, just because the recipient/initiatior happens to be in the US or a US citizen).

Michael Hayden, who The Merrcury News refers to as the nation's No. 2 intelligence official, defended domestic eavesdropping by insisting that the U.S. doesn't waste time spying on ''innocent Americans'' [my emphasis] (http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/news/politics/13697424.htm). Does this mean that it is ok to spy on innocent non-Americans? Furthermore, who says that the person who in fact is under surveillance is not innocent? "Innocent" is a legal label, just as "guilty" is, and it is up to a court to determine whether a person is innocent or guilty. So either the NSA are overstepping their authority when deciding for themselves who is innocent and who is guilty, or there must be a prior sentence. Now if there is a prior sentence, the question to ask is 'of what?'. Will any prior sentence do, like a speeding ticket, or does it have to be related to the reason for which he is being spied on? What in fact is Hayden saying? -PJ<br/>+:Well, yes. A FISA based surveillance order is authorised by the FISC if there is probable cause that a person is an agent of a foreign power. This applies to [[Detailed breakdown of the USA PATRIOT Act, Title II|Title II of the Patriot Act]], the specific sections that I'd suggest that you review are Section 214: Pen register and trap and trace authority, and Section 215: Access to records and other items under FISA. Section 215 states that the US Govt may "make an application for an order requiring the production of any tangible things (including books, records, papers, documents, and other items) for an investigation to obtain foreign intelligence information not concerning a United States person or to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities".<br/>+:Now the definition of foreign intelligence is defined in {{usc-clause|50|1801|(e)(2)}} to mean "information with respect to a foreign power or foreign territory that relates to, and if concerning a United States person is necessary to the national defense or the security of the United States; or the conduct of the foreign affairs of the United States."<br/>+:From what I understand (please be aware IANAL) the court is not meant to decide on the validity of the information when they authorise the order (the lawyer Andrew McCarthy [[Patriot Debates#Sections 214 and 215|says]] that "it is not the judiciary’s place to question bona fides of a co-equal branch carrying out its own constitutional function"), but it is meant to authorise the order based on whether it does or does not violate the constitutional rights of citzens. The FISC's role in the FISA surveillance order is to make sure the [[executive branch]] is not abusing its powers. They don't decide whether the surveillance is actually correct and supervise the order, they just make sure that the surveillance is being done in accordance with the law, and doesn't step outside of this.<br/>+:Hope this makes sense. - [[User:Ta bu shi da yu|Ta bu shi da yu]] 03:05, 27 January 2006 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+== Time of initiation of domestic spying ==<br/>+<br/>+From http://www.truthout.org/docs_2006/011306Z.shtml:<br/>+<br/>+:The National Security Agency advised President Bush in early 2001 that it had been eavesdropping on Americans during the course of its work monitoring suspected terrorists and foreigners believed to have ties to terrorist groups, according to a declassified document.<br/>+<br/>+:The NSA's vast data-mining activities began shortly after Bush was sworn in as president and the document contradicts his assertion that the 9/11 attacks prompted him to take the unprecedented step of signing a secret executive order authorizing the NSA to monitor a select number of American citizens thought to have ties to terrorist groups.<br/>+<br/>+truthout.org is a partisan website, but it seems to me the notion that, like invading Iraq, he considered or started this before 9/11 is note-worthy.

But we need to stop pretending like this is something new.  The issue is not when this began. The issue is the president's goals/motives/rationale.

It was released to critical and public acclaim and is regarded by many as a milestone in movie history, helping to establish an ascendant [[independent film]] movement in the United States.  Its fragmented storyline, [[eclectic]] dialogue, [[irony]] and [[Camp (style)|camp]] influences, unorthodox camerawork, and numerous [[pop culture]] references have since colored countless movies.  Tarantino and Avary won [[Academy Awards]] for [[Best Original Screenplay]] and the film was nominated for seven Oscars in total, including [[Best Picture]]. The film runs in non-chronological order, as almost all of Tarantino's films do. This style of telling a story in a discontinuous order became a popular film trend that was widely mimicked throughout the [[90s]]. <br/>+== Disputed ==<br/> <br/>-The film's title refers to the [[pulp magazine]]s popular during the mid&ndash;[[20th century]], known for their strongly graphic nature.<br/>+According to ''Watch the Skies'', by Curtis Peebles, 27-29, "In mid-February 1949, a meeting was held at Los Alamos to discuss the green fireballs. Making up the group were military officers, Los Alamos scientists, La Paz, atmospheric physicist Dr. Joseph Kaplan, and [[Edward Teller]].  ... Most had seen a green fireball.  La Paz led a group who believed the green fireballs were not natural objects.  ... Most people at the meeting felt that green fireballs were simply unusual meteors.  Green meteors, although not common, where known.  ... After two days, the group concluded that green fireballs were a natural phenomenon."  [[User:Bubba73|Bubba73]] [[User talk:Bubba73|(talk)]], 00:50, 4 December 2005 (UTC)<br/> <br/>-==Reception and influence==<br/>-''Pulp Fiction'' is perennially found both on critics' lists (such as the [[100 Years Series|AFI's One Hundred Years, 100 Movies List]]) and in popular rankings, placing consistently in the top 10 on the [[IMDB|IMDB Top 250 List]].  In [[2000]], readers of ''[[Total Film]]'' magazine voted it the 18th greatest comedy film of all time. In Britain (2001), it was voted as the 4th greatest film of all time in a nationwide poll for Channel 4, beaten only by ''[[The Shawshank Redemption]]'', ''[[The Godfather]]'' and ''[[Star Wars]]''.  In [[2005]], Time.com named it one of the 100 best movies of the last 80 years. It won the 1994 ''[[Palme d'Or]]'' at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.  It was named Best Picture by the [[:Los Angeles Film Critics Association|L.A. Film Critics Association]] and the [[National Society of Film Critics]].  Many critics, including [[Siskel and Ebert]], have compared Tarantino's success with ''Pulp Fiction'' to that of [[Orson Welles]] after the release of his ''[[Citizen Kane]]''.<br/>+: I've added an external link on the main page to the actual final report of Project Twinkle. A small quote:  "There has been no indication that even the somewhat strange observations often called "Green Fireballs" are anything but natural phenomena. " [[User:Bubba73|Bubba73]] [[User talk:Bubba73|(talk)]], 16:24, 11 December 2005 (UTC)<br/> <br/>-The movie was moderately controversial at the time of its release, partly due to the graphic violence and partly due to its perceived racism, as Jackson and Travolta played moderately sympathetic characters who freely used the words "[[motherfucker]]" and "[[nigger]]" (along with variations of the respective words).<br/>+: Quoting from [http://ufocasebook.com/ruppeltbook04.html]<br/> <br/>-The success of ''Pulp Fiction'' spurred studios to release a slew of "copycat" films soon after that tried to duplicate the film's formula of witty and offbeat dialogue, an elliptical/non-chronological plot and unconventional storyline, and gritty subject matter.  Most, if not all of these films, did not fare well at the box office and were dismissed by critics as inferior and derivative, though the [[rave party|raver]] film ''[[Go (1999)|Go]]'' did receive critical acclaim, as did [[Guy Ritchie]]'s ''[[Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels]]''; the latter being a particularly successful transplant of the film's basic premise into the underworld of [[London]].<br/>+::... "This was one conference where there was no need to discuss whether or not this special type of UFO, the green fireball, existed. Almost everyone at the meeting had seen one. The purpose of the conference was to decide whether the fireballs were natural or man-made and how to find out more about them. "...<br/> <br/>-The unconventional attitude of the movie, in particular its lack of a standard [[chronology|chronological]] structure, has often led the film to be cited as an example of a [[postmodernism|postmodernist]] film.<br/>+::: ... "People who were at that meeting have told me that Dr. La Paz's theory was very interesting and that each point was carefully considered. But evidently it wasn't conclusive enough because when the conference broke up, after two days, it was decided that the green fireballs were a natural phenomenon of some kind. " ...<br/> <br/>-The film had a significant impact on the lives of its cast members.  It revived the fortunes of [[John Travolta]] who was going through a career slump at the time, and [[Bruce Willis]] solidified his career as a leading man and taking on a different range of character.  It got [[Uma Thurman]] onto the Hollywood A-list and led to more work for character actors such as [[Ving Rhames]] and [[Harvey Keitel]].  However, the actor who gained the most from ''Pulp Fiction'' was [[Samuel L. Jackson]], who wowed critics and audiences in a part Quentin Tarantino wrote especially for him.  Once relegated to supporting roles, Jackson became an instant star after the film.<br/>+::: and ... "He mentioned Dr. La Paz and his opinion that the green fireballs might be man-made, and although he respected La Paz's professional ability, he just wasn't convinced." ...<br/> <br/>-==Theme and Storylines==<br/>-To observe that the theme of "redemption" is the driving force of this film is almost banal. In some respects, any and every movie is an exploration of this idea. To wit, some of Hollywood's most successful films ever, which assemble near the top of the [[IMDb]]'s [[Top 100 Movies]], are all explorations of this theme ([[The Shawshank Redemption]], [[The Godfather]], [[Star Wars]], etc...)<br/>+::: ... "From the conversations, I assumed that these people didn't think the green fireballs were any kind of a natural phenomenon. Not exactly, they said, but so far the evidence that said they were a natural phenomenon was vastly outweighed by the evidence that said they weren't. " ...<br/> <br/>-Using many elements of a [[black comedy]] with many stylistic and pop culture touches, ''Pulp Fiction'' weaves through the intersecting storylines of Los Angeles gangsters, fringe characters, petty thieves and a mysterious [[briefcase|attaché case]].  Following Quentin Tarantino's more traditional crime movie, ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'', the storyline is chopped up, rearranged and shown out of sequence, a technique borrowed from French ''[[nouvelle vague]]'' (New Wave) directors such as [[Jean-Luc Godard]] (''[[Bande à part]]'') and [[François Truffaut]] and from low-budget American crime films such as [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[The Killing]]'' ([[1956]]), [[Orson Welles]]' ''[[Touch of Evil]]'' ([[1958]]) and [[Don Siegel]]'s ''[[The Killers (1964 film)|The Killers]]'' ([[1964]]).  The highly stylized and fluid action sequences and deadpan dialogue were inspired by Italian director [[Sergio Leone]]'s famed ''[[Spaghetti Western]]'' pictures of the 1960s.<br/>-<br/>-{{spoiler}}<br/>-<br/>-There are four main storylines in ''Pulp Fiction'': Vincent and Jules; Mia Wallace; Butch Coolidge; and Pumpkin and Honey Bunny.

Jackson as Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield, respectively. Here, they are depicted in Tarantino's signature trunk shot.]]<br/>+This is simply bunk!  Don't take my word for it.  You can read the transcript of the meeting online here:  [http://www.project1947.com/gfb/cap21649.html]<br/> <br/>-[[Contract killer|Hitmen]] Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent Vega (John Travolta) head to a [[Los Angeles]] [[apartment]] to retrieve a [[briefcase]] that was involved in a failed deal for their boss, [[gangster]] [[Marsellus Wallace]] ([[Ving Rhames]]). They also have to kill Brett ([[Frank Whaley]]), the one who was supposed to have set up the deal, and his cohorts.  The briefcase is a classic [[MacGuffin]], whose contents are never revealed except indirectly as a glowing yellow light (a homage to the 1955 [[Robert Aldrich]] film ''[[Kiss Me Deadly]]'' and the 1984 [[Alex Cox]] project ''[[Repo Man]]'').  While there has been speculation among fans that the case contains something of supernatural origin, possibly Marsellus' [[soul]], the most sensible explanation is clearly that the case contained gold bars although this is actually quite unlikely given the weight of a briefcase of gold bars would be too heavy to carry around with one hand.<br/>+As you'll see if you read it, most of the meeting was devoted to La Paz describing his findings to date and a lot of questions being asked of him.  It is simply not true that "most people at the meeting felt felt that the green fireballs were simply unusual meteors."  It is more proper to say that they mostly deferred to La Paz's expertise, were puzzled, and had no explanation.  Scientists like Teller and Bradbury did ''speculate'' about possible natural origins like meteors but agreed that findings like flat trajectories and absence of sound would probably ruled that out.  Teller suggested possibly an atmospheric electrical phenomenon, but Bradbury noted that in itself would have problems as an explanation.<br/> <br/>-[[Image:Pulp_fiction,0.jpg|thumb|right|250px|John Travolta (left) and Samuel L. Jackson as Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield, respectively.]]<br/>+Peebles statement that "green meteors, although not common, were known" is also misleading and was dealt with at the conference.  As La Paz notes, the green fireballs were a lime-green or yellow-green, but "green" meteors, besides being rare, were actually blue-green:<br/> <br/>-After a long and bizarre conversation led by the Scripture-spouting Jules, the pair shoot and kill Brett and two of his accomplices, quickly departing with the last of the gang, who in fact is Jules' informant, Marvin.  Shortly afterward, while in Jules' car, Vincent accidentally shoots Marvin in the head, killing him, and the two hitmen quickly try to find a place to hide and clean up the mess in the car with the aid of snotty suburbanite Jimmie Dimmick (Quentin Tarantino) and the associate/henchman of Marsellus, the dapper and mysterious Winston Wolfe (Harvey Keitel).  Jackson's and Travolta's characters had been reportedly inspired by the pair of hitmen played by [[Lee Marvin]] and [[Clu Gulager]] in Don Siegel's 1964 film ''The Killers'' and the obscure 1965 French actioner ''[[Je Vous Salue, Mafia!]]'' starring [[Henry Silva]] and [[Jack Klugman]].<br/>+Dr. Bradbury:   Green is not an unknown color in meteors? <br/> <br/>-During the encounter in Brett's apartment, one of the accomplices emerges from the bathroom and sends a hail of bullets towards Jules and Vincent, both of whom sustain no impact. Jules interprets this as divine intervention, which causes him deep reflection. He recognizes he has been "redeemed" and he will ultimately decide to renounce his gangster life and devote his life to serving God. He makes this decision at The Diner: in so doing, he decides not to kill Pumpkin. The redemption of Jules paved the way for the redemption of Pumpkin and, by extension, Honey Bunny.<br/>+Dr. LaPaz:  If I were to rewrite the report that I first presented on that subject instead of saying "rarely observed" this color green, I think I would now say "never observed".  You sometimes see green, Dr. Bradbury, but it is a blue-green.  The blue-green color is rare, but it is observed.  For instance, Dr. Sherman Smith's observation was essentially a blue-green, but on the blue side. <br/> <br/>-===Mia Wallace===<br/>-[[Image:Pulp Fiction Mia.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Uma Thurman plays Mia Wallace.]]<br/>-At Marsellus' request, Vincent Vega shows his wife Mia (Uma Thurman) a good time while Marsellus is out of town.  Vinnie shows up at Mia's house and while waiting for her to get ready, she plays a classic song on the sound system.  The song was the hit "[[Son of a Preacher Man]]", by [[Dusty Springfield]].  They head to the (fictional) [[restaurant]] Jack Rabbit Slim's, a slick [[1950s]]-[[theme restaurant|themed restaurant]] with lookalikes of the decade's top [[pop culture]] icons as staff (e.g., television impresario [[Ed Sullivan]] as the [[maître d']], and servers such as singer [[Buddy Holly]] and actresses [[Marilyn Monroe]] and [[Mamie van Doren]]), an option for patrons to eat at a booth or a [[classic car]] refitted as a booth, and the famous "Five-Dollar [[Milkshake]]". ("God-damn, that's a pretty fuckin' good milk-shake!")<br/>+...Dr. Bradbury:   But it's apparently a yellowish-green we're talking about here.  If you can see a bluish-green, you can also see yellows and whites. <br/> <br/>-Vincent and Mia make small talk, wherein she recounts her experience as an actress in a failed television [[television pilot|pilot]], "Fox Force Five."  The show followed the exploits of an all-female team of secret agents, each having a particular specialty (this premise inspired the theme for the [[Spice Girls]]' [[1996]] [[music video]] for their song "[[Say You'll Be There]]" in which the girls adopt similar fictional identities).  Mia's character, Raven McCoy, was raised by circus performers and (according to the show) was "''...the deadliest woman in the world with a knife''."  She also knew a "zillion" old jokes her grandfather, an old [[vaudeville|vaudevillian]], taught her, though she refuses to share with Vincent the joke Raven tells in the pilot out of fear of being embarrassed. <br/>+Dr. LaPaz:   There is some defect, possibly in the vision, that requires a pretty high intensity in that yellow-green before it's noted in a meteor fall. <br/> <br/>-Mia then demands that Vincent dance with her in the Jack Rabbit Slim's [[Twist (dance)|twist]] contest and they dance to [[Chuck Berry]]'s "You Never Can Tell".  When they return to the Wallace house, she is seen carrying the trophy.  While listening to [[Urge Overkill]]'s version of [[Neil Diamond]]'s "Girl, You'll Be A Woman Soon", Mia overdoses after snorting [[heroin]], that she finds in Vince's coat pocket, which she was wearing, believing it to be [[cocaine]]. A fearful Vincent tries to save her life with the aid of the small-time drug dealer ([[Eric Stoltz]]) who had previously sold him the heroin.  Mia is finally revived after Vincent, at the climax of a painfully comic and suspenseful scene, stabs her in the heart with a syringe full of [[adrenaline]]. <br/>+(Please note that this means that your example that you inserted at the end of the article of "green" meteor is also misleading.  It is instead an example of a blue-green meteor mentioned by La Paz, not the strange yellow-green fireballs.)<br/> <br/>-Mia wakes up with a howl and when asked to say something, says "something".  The drug dealer's dysfunctional wife ([[Rosanna Arquette]]) remarks "trippy".<br/>+Peebles is also wrong about the meeting lasting two days.  It doesn't seem that Peebles bothered to read the minutes and just made up most of his statements about what transpired.<br/> <br/>-Upon arriving back at the Wallace residence, Mia finally reveals her corny joke: "''So there's Papa Tomato, Momma Tomato and Baby Tomato walking along the street.  Baby Tomato starts lagging behind, and Papa Tomato starts getting really angry.  So, he turns around and squishes Baby Tomato and says, 'Ketchup.' (Catch Up) ''"<br/>+Please remove the "disputed" flag.  There is nothing to dispute here other than the accuracy of Peebles.<br/> <br/>-In their last conversation, they agree not to tell Marcellus of the overdosing incident, both fearing what he might do to either of them. In this, they both "redeem" each other.<br/>+Realize Bubba that just because a skeptic writes something that you apparently want to believe doesn't mean they're telling the truth or have their facts straight.  You've done the same over on the Majestic 12 write-up, just regurgitating Klass, even though many of his objections are provably false.  It's going to take some time to clean up the many factual errors in that article as presently written, while trying to present both sides.  [[Dr Fil]], 5 December 2005<br/>+-----<br/>+This is nonsense.<br/>+Green fireballs are quite common; the colour is caused by the ionisation of oxygen. Here is a link to a page which explains that, with a nice picture of green fireballs to boot. http://www.cloudbait.com/science/fireballs.html<br/>+The colour of ionised oxygen is also visible in aurorae; I have seen it that context and it is neither blue-green nor lime green, but a middle range green, so could easily be observed as either. It looks to me as if this Dr LaPaz was mistaken in that respect.<br/>+He was mistaken too if he accepted the estimates of height made by some of the witnesses; meteors and bolides are generally observed at heights of 20-40 kilometers, not a few thousand feet, although most observers think they are much closer and lower. So that makes Dr LaPaz's estimates of speed almost certainly inaccurate.<br/>+eburacum<br/>+-------<br/>+It is pretty clear that you again don't know what you're talking about.  LaPaz wasn't using estimates of height or speed by witnesses.  Where did you dream that up?  LaPaz always ''triangulated'' such data from at least two different sets of witnesses, which is something completely different, because you get quantitative results, not estimates.  It's a technique he had used for a very long time to determine trajectories of meteor fireballs, find the impact point, and then recover meteorites.  He was considered one of the world's experts in doing this.  Triangulation from witness accounts is still used in tracking down meteorites.<br/> <br/>-Tarantino has noted that he first thought of the premise and main character (The Bride) of ''[[Kill Bill]]'' during the writing and filming of this scene.  The "Fox Force Five" bears a striking resemblance to the [[Deadly Viper Assassination Squad|"DiVAS"]] of ''Kill Bill''.<br/>+In the case of the huge green fireball of January 30, 1948, literally hundreds of witnesses were interviewed.  Again LaPaz came up with anomously low altitude and speed, based on ''triangulated'' reconstruction of trajectory, not witness guesses.  I don't think you know the difference.<br/> <br/>-===Butch Coolidge===<br/>-[[Image:Pulp Fiction Butch.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) in the pawnshop.]]<br/>-Aging [[Boxing|prizefighter]] Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) accepts a large sum of money from Marsellus, agreeing to "[[match fixing|take a dive]]" (deliberately lose a fight) by allowing himself to be knocked out in the fifth round of his upcoming match.  However, Butch double-crosses Marsellus, instead betting the money he received from Marsellus on himself (with, due to the fight's being fixed, presumably very favorable odds) and winning the bout, accidentally killing his opponent in the process.  Although now flush with cash, Butch must quickly leave town, as a vengeful Marsellus is hot on his trail. (Butch's character and his situation appear to have been inspired by a similar character previously played by [[Robert Ryan]] in the 1949 [[film noir]] classic ''[[The Set-Up (1949)|The Set-Up]]''. As originally written Butch is supposed to be in his twenties but the age was adapted to accommodate Willis)<br/>+As for the green color, the color of the green fireballs was ''lime-green'', not blue- green from ionized oxygen.  LaPaz knew all about occasional blue-green color being reported in meteors. He knew about blue-green auroras.  LaPaz had been watching the skies and studying meteor reports for over 30 years.  He said the color was completely unlike any other meteor he had ever observed or had ever been reported.  LaPaz was a world-class astronomer and meteor expert, not some CSICOP skeptic who doesn't even have the basic facts straight.<br/>+----------------<br/>+More nonsense. Lime green is a subjective assessment of the colour, and auroral ionised oxygen often tends toward lime green shades.<br/>+Examples here<br/>+http://www.windows.ucar.edu/earth/Magnetosphere/aurora/images/aurora_1_hao_comet.jpg<br/>+http://local.aaca.org/fairbanks/images/Aurora%20photo-green.jpg<br/>+http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/spaceweather/lenticular/green_aurora.jpg<br/>+http://www.abmedia.com/astro/aurora/aurora110904-12.jpg<br/>+These images look mid-range green to yellow green to me, rather than blue green.<br/>+In fact I have never seen a noticably blue-green aurora; that suggests to me that LaPaz was consciously or subconsciously biased in  favour of anomaly in this case.<br/>+Triangulation of meteor heights using witnesses is inaccurate to an order of magnitude or more unless you have instrumentation; luckily one 'green fireball' sighting at White Sands did involve triangulation using cinetheodolites. The height calculated was 150,000 feet (45 kilometers) which is entirely consistent with a meteor.<br/>+eburacum<br/>+------------------------<br/> <br/>-There is also a flashback at the beginning of the "The Gold Watch" storyline (Butch's story), in which the child Butch Coolidge ([[Chandler Lindauer]]) receives his watch from a buddy of his father's ([[Christopher Walken]]), his father having died in a [[Vietnam War]] prison camp.  This gold watch, which has been passed down from father to son since his great-grandfather fought in [[World War I]], is of great sentimental value to Butch.<br/>-<br/>-Butch is compelled to return to his apartment to retrieve the wristwatch after he discovers his girlfriend Fabienne ([[Maria de Medeiros]]) has forgotten to pack it.  Satisfied no one awaits to kill him in his apartment, he grabs a pack of toaster pastries, an imitation of [[Pop-Tarts]], in his kitchen and puts them in the toaster on the counter.  While waiting for the pastries to pop out, Butch finally notices a [[MAC-10]] submachinegun on the kitchen counter (not his own).  Upon hearing his toilet flush, he readies himself in time to encounter Vincent coming out of the bathroom.  The toaster pastries pop and Butch fires the gun, killing Vincent. Vincent had been "thrice redeemed" (once by Mia, once in the apartment, and finally through Marsellus' sending of "The Wolfe" to clean up Vincent's mess, having accidentally shot Marvin in the face) and failed to acknowledge as Jules did that something special had happened. His death can be considered a "judgment" of sorts.<br/>-<br/>-Although it is never shown that Marsellus was at Butch's apartment, there are clues in the scene suggesting that Marsellus was indeed present.  First, after Butch leaves his apartment, he finds Marsellus walking across the street holding two cups of coffee, presumably one for himself and another for Vincent.  This would also explain why Butch encounters Marsellus shortly after leaving the apartment.  Second, it would seem odd that a professional like Vincent would not keep his gun with him: the answer is that the submachine gun may have belonged to Marsellus. Otherwise, it might also simply have been an indication that, after three redemptive occurances that are unacknowledged by Vincent, he becomes "lazy", losing his edge, not keeping his gun with him. This is in marked contrast to the Diner scene where he emerges from the washroom very prepared to act. In fact, his being in the washroom in each of scenes (Mia's, The Diner, and his closing act) indicate the washroom is a type of womb for him, keeping him out of harm's way. Emerging from the washroom should happen after the trouble is past or he is prepared to deal with whatever is in front of him. In this last situation, he emerges unprepared; perhaps one more interventive act on his part is no longer worthwhile, given he has "missed" all the others and their significance.<br/>-<br/>-While driving back to the motel from the apartment complex, Butch accidentally (and literally) runs into Marsellus himself.  The scene of Marsellus crossing Butch's path is reminiscent of a scene in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Psycho]]''.  Following a scuffle replete with car collisions, gunplay and [[wikt:fistfight|fisticuffs]], Butch and Marsellus are captured and tied up by a couple of [[hick]]s (a [[pawnshop]] owner and a security guard) who turn out to be sexual predators and [[sadist]]s.  They take Marsellus into the back room and rape him; Butch escapes his bonds and in a disturbing, comic, and somewhat surreal scene, he is faced with the choice of saving himself or aiding Marsellus. Knowing Marcellus wanted him dead, he could easily have left Marsellus in the hands of the odd-ball assailants. Butch, on the other hand, makes a choice to release Marsellus, risking that he might fail or that Marsellus might not accept his overture. <br/>-<br/>-He looks around the shop, finding a hammer, a baseball bat, a chainsaw and finally a [[katana]] on the top of the shelf and attacks the rapists with it, allowing Marsellus to free himself. Once the rapists have been subdued, Butch re-emasculates the violated Marsellus by submitting himself to Marsellus' judgment. Butch asks "what now?" and awaits Marsellus' decision. Marsellus, who originally intended to hunt Butch down and exact his revenge for the botched boxing fix, now must realize that Butch has both saved his life and submitted to him: he decides that Butch is free as long as he never tells anyone about the incident of his rape, and never returns to LA. Butch is free, redeemed, as is Marsellus.<br/>-<br/>-Tarantino has also noted that the katana inspired its use as the basis of the samurai action sequences of ''Kill Bill''.<br/>-<br/>-The scene in the pawnshop, which is filled with [[Nazism|Nazi]] and [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[memorabilia]], is somewhat reminiscent of a confrontation in the 1993 film ''[[Falling Down]]'', in which [[Michael Douglas]], an unemployed aerospace engineer on a rampage through Los Angeles, confronts the owner of a similar establishment, and asserts his implicitly anti-Fascist Americanism in the confrontation.<br/>-<br/>-===Pumpkin & Honey Bunny===<br/>-[[Image:Pulp Fiction Pumpkin and Honey Bunny.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Pumpkin (Tim Roth, right) and Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer) hold up the diner.]]<br/>-Over a late breakfast in a [[diner]], a pair of petty thieves, Pumpkin/Ringo ([[Tim Roth]]) and Honey Bunny/Yolanda ([[Amanda Plummer]]), discuss the merits of robbing restaurants instead of their usual targets, small banks and liquor stores.  After establishing that restaurants are far easier and more lucrative to rob (the employees are less invested in the business, and there are plenty of customers with fat wallets), they spontaneously decide to hold up the diner, demanding all the patrons' money and valuables.  Vincent and Jules (fresh from Jimmie's house, wearing a couple of "dorky" borrowed [[T-shirt]]s) happen to be among the diner patrons.  When Ringo demands that Jules hand over the case, Jules holds him at gunpoint in a semi-[[Mexican standoff]] with Yolanda (and Vincent, who emerges from the restroom with gun drawn and pointed at Yolanda; in this standoff, not everyone will die, because no one has a gun pointed at Vincent).  Jules explains his ambivalence toward his life of crime, takes his wallet back from Ringo (sans the cash inside because Jules "bought Ringo's life"), and lets the pair go free.<br/>-<br/>-==Plot devices==<br/>-===The mysterious briefcase===<br/>-[[Image:Pulp-Fiction-Breifcase2.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The code for the briefcase: 6-6-6.]]<br/>-The only indisputable observations about the stolen attaché case recovered by Jules and Vincent are that its latch lock combination is "[[Number of the Beast (numerology)|666]]", the "number of the Beast" as given in the Biblical [[Book of Revelation]], and that the contents of the case either glow or are highly reflective.  Whenever asked, director Tarantino has replied that there is no explanation for the case's contents: it is simply a [[MacGuffin]].  The case is most likely a nod to Robert Aldrich's 1955 film noir ''Kiss Me Deadly'', in which a similar briefcase glows because it contains a small nuclear device.  Originally, the ''Pulp Fiction'' case was to contain diamonds, but this was seen as too mundane.<br/>-<br/>-[[Image:Pulp Fiction-Briefcase.jpg|thumb|250px|Vincent opens the mysterious briefcase]]<br/>-The obvious impression left on most viewers is that the case contained bars of solid gold bullion, which would account for both the reflective yellow-orange glow and the shock and awe expressed by Pumpkin.  That said, fans have offered up several alternate theories, the most popular of which says that Brett had made a deal with Marsellus Wallace for Marsellus' [[soul]].  According to this theory, the exit point of Marsellus' soul was in the back of the neck, explaining the conspicuous [[Band-Aid]] on that spot. (The bandage's actual purpose was that [[actor]] Ving Rhames wanted to cover up a visible [[keloid]] scar.)  When Brett is killed, a golden light similar to the briefcase's glow flares across the screen; according to the theory, the light is Brett's soul departing from his body.  Of course, the various other characters who depart this world during the course of the movie do not end with flashes of light.  It may be that the light in the gunfight is actually intended to be a dramatization of the muzzle flashes from Jules' and Vincent's guns. The lock combination of "666" also suggests a spiritual explanation, and that the contents are bound up in evil deeds. There is at least one piece of potential proof against the soul theory, however: towards the end of the movie in the diner scene, when Jules lets Pumpkin look inside the case, Pumpkin seems to recognize the contents, as proved by the line "Is that what I think it is?" It seems odd that Pumpkin would have seen Marsellus' soul before. He also remarks that it's "beautiful." Marsellus soul most likely wouldn't be beautiful, due to the person he is.<br/>-<br/>-For filming purposes, the briefcase contained an orange lightbulb with a battery.<br/>-<br/>-===Jules' Bible passage===<br/>-[[Image:Pulp Fiction-Bible.jpg|left|250px|thumb|"And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers."]]<br/>-As explained by Jules in the final scene in the diner, he recites a passage from the [[Bible]] &mdash; [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 25:17 &mdash;  each time he kills someone.  The passage reads as follows:<br/>-:''The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is he who in the name of charity and good will shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children.  And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers.  And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee.''<br/>-<br/>-{{wikisourcepar|Bible, King James, Ezekiel#Chapter 25}}<br/>-This is, in fact, not an actual passage from the Bible, but a [[collage]] of several passages. Ezekiel 25:17 in the King James Version reads:<br/>-:''And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall lay my vengeance upon them.''<br/>-<br/>-This is actually a typically obscure [[homage|reference]] to '''Karate Kiba''' / '''Chiba the Bodyguard''', a 1976 film starring [[Sonny Chiba]] (whom Tarantino has hailed as ''"the greatest actor to ever work in martial arts films"''), which opens with a nearly identical misquote, likewise attributed to Ezekiel 25:17:<br/>-<br/>-:''The path of the righteous man and defender is beset on all sides by the iniquity of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is he, who in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper, and the finder of lost children.  And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious anger, who poison and destroy my brothers; and they shall know that I am Chiba the Bodyguard when I lay my love upon them! (Ezekiel 25:17)''<br/>+  <br/>+Color, speed and altitude weren't the only anomalous characteristics.  Absence of sound was another.<br/>+----------------------<br/>+Absence of sound in a meteor observation is not an anomaly, it is the expected situation. As meteors occur several tens of kilometers away from the observer any sound which might be noticed would be heard a number of minutes later. Just for your information, the question of sound in meteors has its own anomalous aspect; some observers report instantaneous sound, which is supposedly impossible. One theory is that radio waves from the meteor are received by equipment near the observer in certain circumstances, and heard as static white noise, But I digress.<br/>+eburacum<br/>+-----------------<br/> <br/> <br/>-Tarantino also uses the toilet or bathroom as a kind of [[deus ex machina]] at key points.  When Jules and Vincent are shooting Brett & his companions, a fourth man is hiding by the toilet, waiting to fire.  Mia takes her drug overdose while Vincent is in the bathroom.  Butch later kills Vincent when he catches him unaware on Butch’s own toilet.  And Jules gets his wallet back from Pumpkin & Honey Bunny when Vincent emerges from the diner toilet.<br/>+Also flat trajectories and occasional observed course changes.  Turning on and off like a light switch.  Lack of a smoke trail.  Confinement in geographical area, with a predilection towards sensitive areas like Los Alamos.  Inability to ever find fragments, despite extensive searches, quite unlike the other meteor fireballs LaPaz had tracked and recovered meteorite fragments from.  This had LaPaz convinced that the green fireballs were artificial, and he wasn't the only one.  Dr. Mariarchi, the first head of Project Twinkle was convinced of it too.  [[User:Dr Fil|Dr Fil]] 18:13, 25 March 2006 (UTC)<br/> <br/>-===Connections to ''Reservoir Dogs''===<br/>-In Tarantino's [[1992 in film|1992]] mainstream directorial debut ''Reservoir Dogs'', [[Michael Madsen]] plays a character named "Vic Vega"&mdash;suspiciously close to Travolta's "Vincent Vega."  Tarantino would later confirm that the two are brothers.  Tarantino originally wanted Travolta for the Vic Vega role in Reservoir Dogs.<br/>+----------------<br/> <br/>-Tarantino's Jimmie Dimmick character in ''Pulp Fiction'' has the same last name as Harvey Keitel's ''Reservoir Dogs'' character Larry Dimmick (Mr. White); however, the two characters are apparently related as brothers or cousins.  Jimmie's wife Bonnie is also possibly the nurse that Larry Dimmick refers to in ''Reservoir Dogs'' when consoling Mr. Orange.<br/> <br/>-There are some who think that the briefcase contains the diamonds from ''Reservoir Dogs''.

The most logical time for the events of the film, then, is July, 1992 (the two other dates closest to the year of filming are 1987 and 1988).  1992 also fits with Butch's being a young boy in the early 1970s.<br/>-*The marquee where Butch boxes, advertises "Vossler vs Martinez".

[[User:Bubba73|Bubba73]] [[User talk:Bubba73|(talk)]], 14:42, 10 February 2006 (UTC)<br/> <br/>-===Influences===<br/>-''Pulp Fiction'' features many direct references to other films.  Tarantino (a former video store clerk) is well-known for having watched nearly every movie in the store before going off to make his first mainstream film, ''Reservoir Dogs''.  The influence of this broad viewing remains prominent in ''Pulp Fiction''.<br/>-* The passage from the Old Testament Book of Ezekiel 25:17 was first read in the [[1967]] film ''[[Karate Kiba]]''.<br/>-* Don Siegel's ''The Killers'' ([[1964]]) concerned two wise-cracking hitmen dressed in tailored black suits.<br/>-* A similar dance sequence took place in [[Jean-Luc Godard]]'s ''[[Bande à part]]'' (in another ode, Tarantino eventually named his production company ''[[A Band Apart]]'').<br/>-* The line "with a pair of pliers and a blow-torch" was originally used in the [[1973]] film ''[[Charley Varrick]]''.<br/>-* As noted above ''Kiss Me Deadly'' and ''[[Repo Man]]'' both feature a case/container opening with nothing seen but a bright light.<br/>-* The [[1978]] film ''[[American Boy]]'' by [[Martin Scorsese]] features [[Steven Prince]] telling the story of a time when he had to inject his friend with adrenaline.  He marked his friend's heart with a red magic marker, used a long-needled syringe, and injected the dosage directly into his friend's heart, after which he immediately became conscious again.<br/>-* The animated [[1957]] film ''[[Three Little Bops]]'' features the drawing of an animated square in mid-air.  So does an episode of ''[[The Flintstones]]''.<br/>-* The exterior shot of Jack Rabbit Slim's is a reference to the [[1973]] film ''[[American Graffiti]]''.<br/>-* The dance sequence in Jack Rabbit Slim's uses the same dance moves and camera sweeps as the dance sequence in [[Federico Fellini|Federico Fellini's]] ''[[8½]]''.<br/>+==Removed Infobox, NPOV, "Pseudoscience"==<br/> <br/>-===Trivia===<br/>-* During the apartment scene after Jules kills Brett, the gunshot holes in the wall behind Jules and Vincent are visible ''before'' the fourth guy comes out of the bathroom shooting his magnum.<br/>+What is the basis for any of these other than personal biases?  How do you define "pseudoscience"?  LaPaz used standard scientific methods for tracking meteors that he had used successfully for 30 years.  The guy was one of the world's experts in meteorites and astronomy.  He was also an expert mathematician and top theoretician in special relativity. This is an obvious smear to try to paint him as a kook.<br/> <br/>-* ''Pulp Fiction'' was originally titled ''Black Mask''.<br/>+As the USAF Directorate of Intelligence noted upon the closing down of Project Twinkle, no satisfactory solution was ever offered:<br/> <br/>-* Other actors considered for the film included [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] as Vincent; [[Paul Calderon]] as Jules; [[Mickey Rourke]], [[Matt Dillon]] and [[Sylvester Stallone]] as Butch; [[Michelle Pfeiffer]], [[Daryl Hannah]], [[Meg Ryan]], [[Joan Cusack]] and [[Isabella Rossellini]] as Mia; [[Johnny Depp]] and [[Christian Slater]] as Pumpkin; and [[Pam Grier]] as Lance's wife Jody, who was later cast in the lead of Tarantino's ''[[Jackie Brown (movie)|Jackie Brown]]''.<br/>+:"The Scientific Advisory Board Secretariat has suggested that this project not be declassified for a variety of reasons, chief among which is that '''no scientific explanation for any of the ‘fireballs’ and other phenomena was revealed by the (Project Twinkle) report''' and that some reputable '''scientists [note plural]''' still believe that the observed phenomena are '''man-made'''."   <br/> <br/>-* Opening titles music: "[[Misirlou]]", a traditional Greek song by John Rubanis, performed by [[Dick Dale]] and The Del-Tones.  The song was re-recorded in the 1980s by Greek garage-rock band "The Last Drive", as well as a hip-hop version by the [[Black Eyed Peas]] titled "Pump It".<br/>+No satisfactory ''scientific'' explanation has been given since then (nonsensical debunking explanations don't count).  LaPaz also wasn't alone in his "beliefs" of artificial origins.  Remember the "scientistS" in the above quote?  One of these was the first director of Project Twinkle, Dr. Anthony Mirarchi, who also agreed with LaPaz.  He was so incensed at the public debunkery, that he went public in 1951 and almost got prosecuted for violating his security oath.  See [[Bruce Maccabee]]'s article on this. [http://www.nicap.org/ncp/ncp-brumac.htm]<br/> <br/>-* During the opening titles, just as the title for music supervisor Karyn Rachtman flashes, we hear a radio dial being tuned to another station, featuring "Jungle Boogie" by [[Kool & the Gang]]. Following the opening titles, you can continue to hear the song in the background, playing on the car radio.<br/>+In addition, the director of [[Project Blue Book]], [[Edward J. Ruppelt]] said that when he went to Los Alamos and spoke to the various scientistS there, almost all of whom had personally seen the green fireballs, they were almost unanimous in believing them NOT to have natural origins but were probably alien probes instead.<br/> <br/>-* "The Gold Watch" sequence was heavily based on a script entitled ''Pandemonium Reigns'', which Tarantino purchased off his friend [[Roger Avary]].<br/>+So I guess all these people were "pseudo-scientists" as well.

Among other things, had they been able to find fragments, they could probably have determined one way or another if the material was artificial or natural.  Accordingly, LaPaz (who said he hoped they were natural) spent a tremendous amount of time and effort trying to locate fragments, using the same triangulation techniques in which he had a high rate of success in locating meteorite fragments following an ordinary fireball.  They were never able to find anything, even though LaPaz, because he was working with military intelligence, had many more resources at his disposal than he usually did.<br/> <br/>-* Chronologically, the last lines of the movie are spoken by Butch Coolidge immediately before riding out of L.A. on a stolen [[chopper (motorcycle)|chopper]]: "Zed's dead, baby.

One of the purposes of Project Twinkle was to gather such data by setting up a network of photographic and observation posts to hopefully film, accurately triangulate, and get such things as spectra.  Twinkle was never properly funded or fully implemented, with only one or two posts in operation at any time, LaPaz's protests notwithstanding.  This wasn't LaPaz's fault.

For each level, the first weapon is a [[baseball bat]], a [[sword]], or a small [[chainsaw]]. A hammer can also be substituted. This may be a reference to the scene in the pawnshop when Butch considers using a hammer, bat, sword (katana), or chainsaw after deciding to rescue Marsellus from the rapists.<br/>-<br/>-*In the first scene of the movie, when Honey Bunny and Pumpkin jump up to begin the robbery, Honey Bunny shouts "Any of you fucking pricks move, I'm gonna execute '''every motherfucking last one''' of you!"

Inability to falsify does not by itself make something "pseudoscience."  If that were the case, many branches of accepted science would immediately become "pseudoscience" because they aren't testable.  E.g., there is currently no way to falsify string theory because it has yet to make a testable prediction.  Some old school particle physicists argue that this makes it a non-science or pseudoscience, yet most physicists probably feel that this is an extreme view.  "Pseudoscience," like beauty, is often in the eye of the beholder.[[User:Dr Fil|Dr Fil]] 16:57, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</td>

His best-known appearances were alongside his long-time comedy partner, [[Ronnie Corbett]], in the very popular TV variety show ''[[The Two Ronnies]]'';  as Norman Stanley "Fletch" Fletcher in the sitcom ''[[Porridge (TV)|Porridge]]'' and its [[BAFTA]] award winning sequel ''[[Going Straight]]''; and working with [[David Jason]] in ''[[Open All Hours]]''.  His skills as a [[character actor]], his love for and facility with the [[English language]], and his gift for comedy made him a well-loved performer.<br/>-<br/>-==Beginnings==<br/>-Barker was born in [[Bedford]] in [[Bedfordshire]]. He had two sisters and the family moved to Oxford when his father, a clerk for Shell Oil, was relocated, when Barker was four years old. He took to writing plays for his family and neighbours, and often sat in the audience of the Oxford Playhouse, his local repertory company, dreaming of fame. Barker attended [[Oxford]] High School and at 16, he left and took a job as a bank clerk - but the theatre called. He wrote to the [[Aylesbury]] Repertory Company in 1948 and his show business career began. Barker then went on to join the [[Oxford Playhouse|Playhouse Theatre]], at the time under the actor-management of [[Frank Shelley]], as an actor and stagehand, at £2 10s (£2.50) per week. The two appeared together there, in [[Ben Travers]]'s ''A Cuckoo in the Nest'' and, subsequently, in a number of other venues and roles. In 1993, Barker dedicated his autobiography to Shelley, whom he called one of the "three wise men who directed my career; without men like these, there would be no theatre."<br/>-<br/>-==Success==<br/>-He then worked as an actor and assistant stage manager with the [[Manchester]] Repertory Company, but was soon spotted by Sir [[Peter Hall]] who gave him a [[West End theatre|West End]] role.  His first [[radio]] appearance was in [[1956]]; he went on to play a variety of minor characters in ''[[The Navy Lark]]'', a navy based [[situation comedy|sit-com]] on the [[BBC Radio 2|BBC Light Programme]] (still available on tape and frequently [[rerun]] on [[BBC 7]]). He later returned to radio in the [[BBC Radio 4]] sketch show ''[[Lines From My Grandfather's Forehead]]''. He acted in the films "Father Came Too" and "The Bargee". On television, he wrote and performed many satirical skits in ''[[The Frost Report]]'', notably a series of trios which he performed with [[Ronnie Corbett]] and [[John Cleese]]. He starred with [[David Jason]] as a bumbling aristocrat in the sit-com ''Hark at Barker''. Both he and Jason are widely recognised as having excellent comic timing and delivery, which accounts for their enduring popularity.  Jason appeared in several episodes of ''Porridge'', and co-starred as Granville, the errand boy and nephew of Barker's stuttering shopkeeper Arkwright in the sitcom ''[[Open All Hours]]'', written by [[Roy Clarke]] (who also wrote ''[[Last of the Summer Wine]]'' and [[Keeping Up Appearances]]). Both ''Porridge'' and ''Open All Hours'' originated as part of the ''[[Seven of One]]'' series. <br/>-[[Image:Normanstanleyfletcher.PNG|thumb|Ronnie Barker starring in Porridge as Fletcher]]<br/>-''Porridge'' ran for three series, two Christmas specials and a film, produced in 1979. Barker privately regarded the series as the finest work of his career. It was followed by the sitcom ''Going Straight'' which, while not as popular as ''Porridge'', did win BAFTA awards. The first came at a time when Barker was grieving the early death of his co-star [[Richard Beckinsale]], and Barker tearfully paid tribute to Beckinsale in his brief acceptance speech. The ''[[Open All Hours]]'' pilot episode was broadcast in March [[1973]], and ran for four series between February [[1976]] and October [[1985]].<br/>-<br/>-Barker was also an accomplished comedy writer.  He provided a good deal of the sketches and songs for ''The Two Ronnies'', and contributed material to many other radio and TV shows&mdash;often under a variety of assumed names (most famously "Gerald Wiley"), so that his work would be considered on merit.  His other credits include the (almost) silent films ''[[A Home of Your Own]]'' (1964), ''[[Futtock's End]]'' (1970), ''[[The Picnic]]'' (1975) and ''[[By the Sea]]'' (1982), the sit-coms ''His Lordship Entertains'', ''[[The Magnificent Evans]]'' and ''[[Clarence (TV series)|Clarence]]'', the plays ''Rub A Dub Dub'' and ''Mum'', and the LP ''A Pint of Old and Filthy''. Straight roles were few and far between, though he did put in a dramatic-comic turn as Cheshire in ''The Hidden Tiger'' episode of the [[1960s]] classic series ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' and as [[Friar Tuck]] in [[Robin and Marian]].<br/>-<br/>-Barker made occasional TV appearances after his [[1988]] retirement, most notably as [[Winston Churchill]]'s butler&mdash;a "straight" role, but with opportunities for comic asides&mdash;in the BBC drama ''[[The Gathering Storm (2002)|The Gathering Storm]]'' in [[2002]]. This was followed up by a role in the film ''[[My House in Umbria]]'' in [[2003]]. In [[2004]] he was given a special [[BAFTA]] award and announced his return to television; he reunited with Ronnie Corbett to record ''[[The Two Ronnies Sketchbook]]'', a clip show of their sketches along with newly recorded introductions.  These were shown in early [[2005]].<br/>-On Wednesday 6th July 2005, another, final special -  ''The Two Ronnies Christmas Sketchbook'', was recorded with new introductions featuring clips from their previous Christmas special shows. This was to be his last television appearance, and sadly, he knew this. This led to an early recording of the special. It was shown at Christmas 2005, two months after his death.<br/>-<br/>-He was voted amongst the top 20 greatest comedy acts ever by fellow comedians and comedy insiders in a [[2005]] poll to find ''[[The Comedian's Comedian]]''.<br/>-<br/>-News of his death made headlines all over the [[United Kingdom]] and in countries with significant populations of migrants from the UK. [[Ronnie Corbett]] said that throughout their many years working together there was never a cross word between them. He also commented that Barker was "pure gold in triplicate - as a comedian, writer and friend".<br/>-<br/>-==Personal life==<br/>-Barker married Joy Tubb in [[1957]] and they had three children: two sons, the actors [[Adam Barker|Adam]] (b. [[1967]]) and [[Larry Barker|Larry]] (b. [[1960]]) and one daughter, the [[actor|actress]] [[Charlotte Barker]] (b. [[1963]]).  He retired to Dean, a hamlet near [[Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire|Chipping Norton]] in [[Oxfordshire]] to run an [[antiques shop]] in [[1987]]. He died in a local [[Hospice care|hospice]] from [[heart failure]] on Monday [[3 October]] [[2005]], aged 76, with his wife by his side. His catchphrase ending from [[The Two Ronnies]] provided the perfect epitaph: ''"Goodnight From Him".''<br/>-<br/>-He had a private [[humanist]] funeral in [[Banbury]], followed by a public memorial service on [[3rd March]] [[2006]] at [[Westminster Abbey]], at which [[Richard Briers]], [[David Jason]] and (from standing on a crate!) [[Ronnie Corbett]] read, a recording of Barker's [[rhyming slang]] sermon was played, and the choir processed in behind four candles, a reference to one of the Two Ronnies' most famous sketches  ([http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4771368.stm BBC report])<br/>-<br/>-His life and work was honoured at the [[BAFTA Television Awards|British Academy Televison Awards]] in [[2006]].<br/>-<br/>-==References==<br/>-<references /><br/>-<br/>-==Further reading==<br/>-*{{cite book | author=Barker, R. | title=All I Ever Wrote: The Complete Works of Ronnie Barker | publisher=Sidgwick & Jackson | year=2001 | id=ISBN 0-283-07334-9}}<br/>-*{{cite book | author=Barker, R. | title=Dancing in the Moonlight: My Early Years | publisher=Hodder & Stoughton | year=1994 | id=ISBN 0-340-59104-8}}<br/>-*{{cite book | author=McCabe, B. | title=Ronnie Barker: The Authorised Biography | publisher=Andre Deutsch | year=1998 | id=ISBN 0-233-99382-7}}<br/>+'''Belgrade''' ([[Serbian language|Serbian]]: ''Београд'' or ''Beograd'' {{Audio|sr-Beograd.ogg|listen}}) is the [[capital]] and largest city of the [[Republic of Serbia]].

It lies at the point where the river [[Sava]] merges into the [[Danube]], on the slope between two alluvial plains. The river waters surround it from three sides, and that is why since ancient times it has been the "''Guardian of river passages''". Because of its position it was often called "the gate" of the Balkans, and "the door" to [[Central Europe]]. The city's main traffic artery stretches from [[Kalemegdan]], along [[Knez Mihailova|Knez Mihailova Street]], and through [[Terazije]] to [[Slavija (Belgrade)|Slavija]].<br/>+<br/>+At Knez Mihailova street, the coordinates of Belgrade are marked:<br/>+*44°49'14" of northern latitude <br/>+*20°27'44" of eastern longitude <br/>+*altitude 116.75 m.<br/>+<br/>+Belgrade is at the intersection of roads that lead between Eastern and Western Europe.  which leads from the [[Morava]]-[[Vardar]] valley and the [[Nišava]]-[[Marica]] valley, to the shores of the [[Aegean Sea]], [[Asia Minor]] and to the [[Middle East]]. The city lies on the Danube River, the sailing route which connects the Western and Central European countries with the countries of South-Eastern and Eastern Europe. After the construction of the [[artificial lake]] and the Đerdap power station, Belgrade became a river and [[sea port]]. Ships from the [[Black Sea]] sail to its docks, and with the opening of the Rhine-Main-Danube canal, Belgrade came to the center of the most important sailing route in Europe: The North Sea - Atlantic - Black Sea route.<br/>+<br/>+===Climate===<br/>+Belgrade has a moderate [[continental climate]], with four seasons. Autumn is longer than spring, with longer sunny and warm periods - the so-called [[Indian summer]]. Winter is not so severe, with an average of 21 days of sub-zero temperature. January is the coldest month, with an average temperature of 0.4 °C. Spring is short and rainy. Summer arrives abruptly.<br/>+<br/>+The average annual air temperature, for the period from 1961 to 1990 was 11.9 °C. The hottest months are July (21.7 °C) and August (21.3 °C). The lowest temperature in Belgrade was recorded on January 10, 1893 (-26.2 °C), and the highest on August 12, 1921 and on September 9, 1946 (41.8 °C).

Its violent history derived some nicknames through different conquerors: "House of the wars", "The cursed beauty", "Key to the Balkans", "Central European gate", "The Balkan queen" etc.<br/>+<br/>+The [[Vinča culture]] existed in or near Belgrade and dominated the Balkans about 8,000 years ago. Settled in the [[3rd century BC]] by the [[Celts]] before becoming the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] settlement of '''[[Singidunum]]''', the site passed to the Eastern Roman or [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Empire.<br/>+<br/>+===Middle Ages===<br/>+<br/>+Singidunum experienced occupation by successive invaders of the region—[[Huns]], [[Sarmatians]], [[Ostrogoths]] and [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]]—before the arrival of the [[Slavic peoples|Slav]]s ([[Serbs]]) around AD 630. First record of the Slavic name ''Beograd'' dates back to 878 A.D., during the rule of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]]. For approximately 400 years the city remained a subject of warfare between [[Byzantium]], [[Hungary|Royal Hungary]] and [[Bulgaria|First Bulgarian Empire]] before finally passing to Serbian rule as a part of [[Kingdom of Syrmia]] in 1283, which joined [[Kingdom of Serbia]] in 1316.<br/>+The first [[List of Serbian monarchs|Serbian king]] to rule Belgrade was [[Stefan Dragutin|Dragutin]] (1276–1282), who received it as a present from [[Hungary|Hungarian]] king. <br/>+{{Quote_box|<br/>+width=140px<br/>+|align=left<br/>+|quote="''I cometh and found the noblest burgh from ancient times,<br/>+the grand town of Belgrade,<br/>+<br/>+by sorry fate destroyed and nearly void.<br/>+<br/>+Having rebuilt it, I consecrated it <br/>+to the Holy Mother of God".''<br/>+|source=[[Stefan Lazarevic|Despot Stefan Lazarevic]] on Belgrade in 1420 A.D.<br/>+|}}<br/>+<br/>+[[Image:Siege of Belgrade, 1584 topkapi.jpg|thumb|180px|right|The [[Siege of Belgrade]] in [[1456]]]]<br/>+<br/>+Following a terrible defeat in the [[Battle of Kosovo]] of 1389, the [[Serbian Empire]] began to crumble, the south being conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The north, however, resisted in the form of the [[Serbian Despotate]], with Belgrade as its capital. The city flourished under [[Despot]] [[Stefan Lazarević]], son of the famous Serbian ruler [[Prince Lazar|Lazar Hrebljanović]]. Its ancient walls were refortified, along with its castles, harbours and churches, which helped to avoid surrender to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] for almost 70 years. At that time Belgrade became a haven for many Balkan peoples escaping Ottoman control. In 1453, the Serbian Despotate fell to the Ottomans, but Belgrade itself invited in [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian kings]] for protection. The Ottomans, however, wanted Belgrade no matter what the cost as it was considered the "key to the Balkans" and also the "key of [[Hungary]]" they invaded in 1456, leading to the famous [[Siege of Belgrade]] where the Christian army under [[John Hunyadi]] successfully defended the city from the Ottomans. This war led to the celebration of Belgrade around Europe as the "Guardian of Christianity". At this time, considered a peak of Belgrade's glory, the city boasted a diverse population numbering well over 100,000 people. Belgrade regulated the traffic between East and West, becoming a "Christian Mecca" and a cultural hub for South-Eastern Europe.<br/>+<br/>+===Turkish conquest===<br/>+[[Image:Fortress_Belgrade.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Belgrade 1789]]<br/>+[[Image:Belgrade04_397 rtc.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The Austrian [[Sahat-kula|Clock Tower]] in the [[Kalemegdan Fortress]]]]<br/>+[[Image:Terazije 1928.jpg|right|250px|thumb| Terazije square in 1928]]<br/>+Under [[Suleyman the Magnificent]], in 1521, the fort was recaptured by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]], and Belgrade remained under Ottoman rule for nearly three centuries. By 1526 Turks had already conquered southern [[Hungary]], by 1541 they held the Hungarian capital, [[Buda]], and by 1563 were already knocking on the door of [[Western Europe]] in [[Vienna]]. The city of Belgrade deteriorated as its buildings were demolished and robbed by the conquerors. It was the site of a major rebellion in 1594- ([[Banat Uprising]]), which was brutally crushed by the Turks, burning the churches and even the coffins of the [[House of Nemanjić]] - see [[Temple of Saint Sava]]. Thrice occupied by [[Austria]] (1688-1690, 1717-1739, 1789-1791), the city was affected by the two [[Great Serbian Migrations]], in which hundreds of thousands of Serbs, led by their [[Patriarch of Serbia|patriarchs]], retreated together with the Austrians into the [[Habsburg Empire]] in 1690 and 1737, settling in today's [[Vojvodina]] and [[Slavonia]]. The city was also briefly held from 1806 to 1813 by Serbian forces during the [[First Serbian Uprising]] against Ottoman rule, and in 1817 it became the capital of the autonomous [[Principality of Serbia]] (except in the period from 1818–1839, when [[Kragujevac]] was the country's capital).<br/>+<br/>+===After independence===<br/>+With the departure of its Turkish garrison in 1867, Serbia's full independence in 1878 and its transformation into the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] in 1882, Belgrade once again became a key city in the Balkans. But despite the opening of a railway to [[Niš]], Serbia's second city, conditions in Serbia as a whole remained those of an overwhelmingly agrarian country, and in 1900 the capital had only 69,000 inhabitants. However, by the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, the city had grown to over 100,000, not counting [[Zemun]] that belonged to [[Vojvodina]]/[[Austro-Hungary]] at that time.<br/>+<br/>+After the occupation by [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] and [[Germany|German]] troops in 1915-1918 during [[World War I]], Belgrade experienced faster growth and significant modernisation as the capital of the new [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] during the [[1920s]] and [[1930s]], growing in population to 239,000 by 1931 with the incorporation of the northern suburb of [[Zemun]], formerly on the Austro-Hungarian bank of the river. <br/>+On [[April 6]], [[1941]], Belgrade was [[Bombing of Belgrade in World War II|heavily bombed]] by the [[Luftwaffe]] (killing thousands of people) and [[Yugoslavia]] was invaded by [[Germany|German]], [[Italy|Italian]], [[Hungary|Hungarian]] and [[Bulgaria]]n forces, aided by domestic [[Albanians]] and [[Croats]]. Most of the city remained under German occupation until [[October 20]], [[1944]], when it was liberated by communist [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Yugoslav Partisans]] and the [[Red Army]], while the western suburbs were incorporated into [[Independent State of Croatia]]. In the post-war period Belgrade grew rapidly as the capital of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|renewed Yugoslavia]], developing as a major industrial centre. <br/>+In March 1972, Belgrade was at the centre of [[1972 outbreak of smallpox in Yugoslavia|the last major outbreak of smallpox in Europe]]. The epidemic, which was contained with enforced quarantine and mass vaccination, was over by late May. <br/>+===Tumultuous 1990's===<br/>+[[Image:Pogled sa Save-big.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Historical urban core of Belgrade, [[Stari Grad]]]]<br/>+On [[March 9]], [[1991]] [[March 9th Protest|massive demonstrations]] were held against [[Slobodan Milošević]] in the city. Two people, high school student Branivoje Milinović and policeman Nedeljko Kosović were killed, and 203 people were injured in the protests, which involved tens of thousands of people. Later that day tanks were deployed onto the streets in order to restore order. Branivoje Milinović (1973–1991), was a 17 year-old Serb high school student. According to his parents, he was just going into the city centre to buy some cassettes when he was killed.  Milinović is considered by many to be the first victim of the [[Yugoslav wars|breakup of Yugoslavia]]. After elections in 2000, Belgrade was the site of major demonstrations with over half a million people on the streets (800,000 by police estimate,<ref>Антонић, Слободан.

The Skadarska Street and the surrounding neighbourhood are lined with some of Belgrade's best and oldest traditional restaurants dating back to the 19th and early 20th century.

The architecture of this church was greatly inspired by the [[Gračanica monastery]] in the province of [[Kosovo-Metohia]]. The church of [[Ružica Church|Sveta Ružica]] in the [[Kalemegdan Fortress]] is one of the holiest places in Belgrade for Serbian Orthodox Christians since this was the site where the body of [[St. Paraskeva]] was preserved for several years after the Ottoman conquest, before being taken to [[Romania]] where it still rests today.

So called “Smart Buildings” are being built everywhere – especially in [[New Belgrade]]. These are only some of the projects under construction in Belgrade:<br/>+<br/>+* [[Airport City Belgrade]]<br/>+* [[Avenue 19 - park apartments]]<br/>+* [[Belgrade Aqua Park]]<br/>+* [[B2 Building]] (Mali Kolektiv)<br/>+* [[Delta City]]<br/>+* [[Europe business center]]<br/>+* [[Partizan Stadium]] (construction/recontruction)<br/>+* [[Sava City]]<br/>+* [[Marina Dorcol]] - [[Engel]] will invest 160 million Euros. Complex (hotels, apartmans...) is to consist of five 13-storey buildings, one 11-storey building and new marina.<br/>+* By the end of the year the City of Belgrade will decide whether to accept the [[Besix]] company’s offer to construct the tallest building in [[Eastern Europe]]. The company wishes to build a 333-metre skyscraper in [[New Belgrade]] with an investment of 250 million euros.<br/>+<br/>+* The [[Ušće Tower]] super centre will start with construction at the end of [[2006]]. Following the construction of the mega market a second twin 130-metre tower should be built.<br/>+<br/>+* [[Prokop]] station project is a mega project that's scheduled to begin in September, resulting in relocation of the main railway station and its railtracks, which will consequently free up building space in [[Belgrade]]'s inner centre. The entire project is worth an estimated 2 billiion dollars and is going to come to an end within a decade. In March, commission of Serbian railways chosen ,,Trigranit" corporation from Hungary to be carrier of this job. In first year, they will invest about 200 million Euros.<br/>+<br/>+==Infrastructure==<br/>+{{main|Transport in Belgrade}}<br/>+Belgrade stands at the confluence of the [[Sava]] and the [[Danube]], two major navigable rivers, and at an important crossroads between Central Europe and the Southern Balkans. This position and the growth of city's population have made the city and its surroundings busy with all kinds of traffic.<br/>+<br/>+===Roads===<br/>+Belgrade is connected by motorways to [[Zagreb]] to the west, [[Novi Sad]] to the north and [[Niš]] to the south. The motorways feed traffic into a large [[interchange (road)|interchange]] popularly called ''Mostar''. A wide boulevard, Ulica Kneza Miloša ([[Miloš Obrenović|Prince Miloš]] Street) connects the interchange to the city centre.<br/>+<br/>+A traffic decongestion project named ''unutrašnji magistralni prsten'' ("internal magistral ring") is set to begin with the goal of easing the congestion in the city centre and on the motorways.<br/>+<br/>+===Bridges===<br/>+{{expert}}<br/>+[[Image:Belgrade_bridges.jpg|220px|thumb|right|View on ''Gazela'', ''Stari savski most'' and ''Brankov most'' from the right bank of Sava river.]]<br/>+[[Image:Belgrade bridges2.jpg|220px|thumb|right|View on ''Gazela'', ''Stari železnički most'' and ''Novi železnički most'' from the air.]]<br/>+There are eight bridges over Sava and one over Danube in and around Belgrade, listed generally from east to west:<br/>+<br/>+*The road [[truss bridge]] over Sava at [[Obrenovac]] &mdash; 30 km southwest of Belgrade, constructed by [[Mostogradnja]] between 1993 and 1999. The total length of the bridge is 912 m. Of this, 460 m passes above the river in five spans, the longest of which is 141 m. The bridge was originally designed to carry only two heating water pipelines, but was later redesigned and built as a road bridge with the two pipelines on side cantilevers.[http://www.mostogradnja.co.yu/English/reference2.htm]<br/>+*The railway [[truss bridge]] over Sava at [[Ostružnica]] &mdash; just outside the urbanized area of Belgrade.<br/>+*Motorway [[girder bridge]] over Sava at Ostružnica on the motorway to Zagreb &mdash; constructed by Mostogradnja between 1990 and 1998. Total length of the bridge is 1,789.6 m, with a 588 m long continuous steel structure crossing the river in five spans. The largest span is 198 m. The bridge was bombed by [[Nato]] during [[Kosovo war]] in 1999 and fully reconstructed by [[2004]].<br/>+*''Novi železnički most'' ("new railroad bridge") over Sava &mdash; a [[cable-stayed bridge]] built in the [[1980s]].<br/>+*''Stari železnički most'' ("old railroad bridge") over Sava &mdash; a truss-bridge.<br/>+*''Gazela'' &mdash; a single span motorway bridge over Sava, the main traffic artery into the city.<br/>+*''Stari savski most'' ("old Sava bridge") &mdash; a 410 m long road and tram bridge. The main span is a [[tied arch bridge]] over 100 m in length. During World War II it was the only bridge to remain intact in Belgrade, and one of the few bridges in Europe which the retreating German forces failed to demolish. In October 1944, the bridge, already laden with explosives and prepared for demolition, was saved by a resistance agent who managed to cut the detonator wires.[http://www.danas.co.yu/20060208/terazije1.html].<br/>+[[Image:Brankos_bridge_from_air.jpg|220px|thumb|right|Branko's bridge from the air.]]<br/>+*''Brankov most'' ("[[Branko Radičević|Branko]]'s bridge") &mdash; a 450 m long road girder bridge over Sava, connecting the center of Belgrade to the densely populated residential suburb of Novi Beograd. Originally built as ''Most kralja Aleksandra'' ("King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander]] Bridge") in 1934 it was the chaine-bridge. The bridge was destroyed in 1941 and rebuilt after the end of World War II as a single span bridge, at the time it was the longest bridge of that kind in the world. <br/>+*''[[Pančevački most]]'' ("[[Pančevo]] bridge") &mdash; a 1,075 m long combined road and railroad truss bridge over the Danube, originally built in 1935. It was destroyed during World War II, and rebuilt after the end of the war 1946. It's the only bridge over [[Danube]] river in Belgrade. <br/>+<br/>+Construction of a new bridge over Sava, which will cross over the tip of [[Ada Ciganlija]] island, is scheduled to start in 2006 and be completed by 2009, significantly reducing traffic passing through the city centre. This new bridge will be a part of the internal magistral ring. The bridge will also carry the third of Belgrade's light-rail lines, connecting the outer parts of [[New Belgrade]] with the central areas.<br/>+<br/>+===Commuter transport===<br/>+The main public transportation system in Belgrade consists of buses (112 lines), trams (12 lines) and trolleybusses (8 lines). In addition, there are 24 taxi companies serving the city.<br/>+[[Image:Picture 139.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Belgrade trolley busses]]<br/>+The regional rail system ([[Beovoz]]) is operated by the national railway company, and connects Belgrade's suburbs with the urban areas. There are six lines with 41 stations. Two underground stations near the city center (''Vukov spomenik'' and ''Karađorđev Park'') are used by lines 1 and 2, and are situated underground. Construction of a three line pre-metro/[[light rail]] transit system is scheduled to begin in 2008, and the first line should be completed by 2010. The construction of the second line from Law School (Faculty of Law) to Topčider will begin in 2009.<br/>+<br/>+===Railways===<br/>+The main railway station is situated near the downtown district, and connects Belgrade with many major European cities, such as [[Istanbul]], [[Venice]], [[Zurich]], [[Athens]], [[Bucharest]], [[Sofia]], [[Vienna]], [[Budapest]], [[Munich]], [[Kiev]] and [[Moscow]].  <br/>+<br/>+A new central railway station has been under construction since 1977 at the site named Prokop.  The new railway station will be called "Beograd Center"; upon its completion all Belgrade rail traffic currently handled by the old railway station situated near the downtown district will be transferred to the new station freeing thousands of square meters of prime real estate along the [[Sava River]] and substantially easing the rail travel into Belgrade.  After years of delay, this ambitious project is set to be completed in the next few years pending the new international tender for its completion set to be announced by the [[government]] at the beginning of March 2006.  The train terminals will be situated underground while the vast passenger terminal will be above ground featuring commercial spaces, possibly a hotel and other amenities.  Most of the rough work on the station's train terminals has been completed thus far.  Belgrade has been restricted in its use of its vast waterfront precisely because of the large rail infrastructure that hug the river banks of the Old Town.  Completion of this station is signaling a major boom in Belgrade's waterfront development.<br/>+<br/>+===Metro===<br/>+By the beginning of [[2008]] Belgrade will start construction of a [[light rail transit]] system.<br/>+<br/>+===Shipping===<br/>+Belgrade has a commercial port on the banks of [[Danube]] named [[Luka Beograd]].  There is also a tourist port on the banks of the [[Sava]] welcoming various river cruise vessels from across Europe.  Belgrade has several impromptu sporting marinas near the islands of [[Ada Ciganlija]] and [[Ada Međica]] harbouring small sail boats and sporting/recreational vessels.  Answering to the need for a real sporting/recreational marina a detailed plan for a marina in [[Dorćol]] on the banks of the [[Danube]] has been presented to the public, and an international tender for its development has been announced.  <br/>+<br/>+===Aviation===<br/>+The international airport, [[Belgrade Airport|Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport]], is located 12 km outside the city. It is connected with the city by the Belgrade-Zagreb highway. It provides connections with many cities in Europe, Asia and Africa.<br/>+Eighteen established international airlines maintain offices at the airport.  The number of airlines using the Belgrade Airport is set to increase on January 1, 2007 when the [[Open skies]] international agreement goes into effect in Serbia, lifting protectionist restrictions the national airline or the government placed on international airline traffic landing rights.<br/>+A major expansion of the airport in Belgrade has been detailed with a development deal signed with DynaCorp. Inc. to build a regional air cargo hub.  Belgrade airport also plans to build a third passenger terminal and another runway; however this may not be feasible in the immediate future.  <br/>+<br/>+There is also a military airport at [[Batajnica]], a suburb of Belgrade. This airport is romoured to be turned into public one to handle low-cost airlines serving the city.<br/>+== Miscellaneous ==<br/>+===Names through history===<br/>+<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Kralja Milana Street.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Kralja Milana street]] --><br/>+The following is a list of names of Belgrade through history:<br/>+{| border=1 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0 class="toccolours" style="align: left;

New Rock boots have undergone a recent explosion in popularity in the UK (though they have not yet infiltrated the [[mainstream]]), but apparently they aren't as common in the US. Because of their popularity some people don't consider them 'unique' enough, or avoid them because they don't want to be seen as following a trend.<br/>+{| align=right<br/>+|-<br/>+|[[Image:Placenta fetus.jpg|thumb|300px|The placenta in the womb, fetal side and maternal side.]]<br/>+|-<br/>+|[[Image:Human_placenta_baby_side.jpg|thumb|300px|Human '''placenta''' shown a few minutes after birth.

The white fringe surrounding the bottom is the remnants of the [[amniotic sac]].]]<br/>+|}<br/> <br/>-The boots themselves tend to be quite expensive, with a basic cost of around $120/£120. There has been debate about the quality of the product and whether the price is worth it, with some people saying the boots are badly made and fall apart easily, and others saying they are highly durable. The conflicting opinions could be caused by the different designs having different durability, or by people mistaking cheaply made knock-offs for the real thing.<br/>+The '''placenta''' is an ephemeral (temporary) organ present only in female [[Placentalia|placental]] [[mammal|mammals]] during [[gestation]] ([[pregnancy]]).<br/> <br/>-==External links== <br/>-*[http://www.newrockstore.com/ New Rock's official online store]<br/>+The placenta is composed of two parts, one of which is genetically and biologically part of the [[fetus]], the other part of the mother.  It is implanted in the wall of the [[uterus]], where it receives nutrients from the mother's [[blood]] and passes out waste.  This interface forms a barrier, the placental barrier, which filters out many substances which could harm the fetus.  However, many other substances are not filtered out, including [[alcohol]].  Most [[virus]]es also easily cross this barrier.<br/> <br/>-{{product-stub}}<br/>+In addition to the transfer of gases and nutrients, the placenta also has metabolic and [[Endocrine system|endocrine]] activity. It produces, amongst other [[hormones]], [[progesterone]] which is important in maintaining the pregnancy, and [[somatomammotropin]] (also known as Placental Lactogen) which acts to increase the amount of glucose and lipids in the maternal blood. This results in increased transfer of these nutrients to the fetus and is also the main cause of the increased blood sugar levels seen in pregnancy.<br/>+<br/>+The placenta is connected to the fetus via the [[umbilical cord]] which is composed of blood vessels and connective tissue.  When the fetus is delivered, the placenta is delivered afterwards (and for this reason is often called the '''afterbirth''').  After delivery of the placenta the umbilical cord is usually clamped and severed or may be left attached to fall off naturally which is referred to as a [[Lotus Birth]].  In most mammalian species, the mother bites the cord and consumes the placenta.<br/>+<br/>+The site of the former umbilical cord attachment in the center of the front of the [[abdomen]] is known as the [[umbilicus]], or navel, or belly-button. <br/>+<br/>+The only non-placental mammals are the [[monotreme]]s, which are egg-laying mammals found only in [[Australia]] and [[New Guinea]]. [[Marsupial]]s, which are found primarily in Australia, have a rudimentary egg-yolk placenta, which degenerates quite early in foetal development. ''-This rudimentary placenta could suggest that marsupials evolved out of placental mammals.-''  Both marsupials and monotremes represent earlier branching of the basal mammalian lineage.<br/>+<br/>+== See also ==<br/>+* [[Placentophagy]]<br/>+<br/>+{{endocrine_system}}<br/>+<br/>+[[Category:Developmental biology]]<br/>+<br/>+[[de:Plazenta]]<br/>+[[es:Placenta]]<br/>+[[eo:Placento]]<br/>+[[fr:Placenta]]<br/>+[[it:Placenta]]<br/>+[[lt:Placenta]]<br/>+[[nl:Placenta]]<br/>+[[ja:胎盤]]<br/>+[[pl:Łożysko (anatomia)]]<br/>+[[pt:Placenta]]<br/>+[[fi:Istukka]]<br/>+[[sv:Moderkaka]]</td>

The Isle of Wight is a [[Ceremonial counties of England|Ceremonial]] and [[Non-metropolitan county|Administrative]] county and as it has no district councils (only the county council) it is effectively a [[Unitary Authority|Unitary]] county, though not officially. It is unique in [[England]] in this way - all other Unitary areas are single districts with no county council, while the Isle of Wight is the other way round. The island is also the highest populated [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]] [[constituency]] in the country.<br/>-<br/>-==Political History==<br/>-<br/>-Historically the island was part of the [[Traditional counties of England|(traditional) county]] of [[Hampshire]], previously called Southamptonshire.<br/>-<br/>-===Historic Boroughs of the Island===<br/>-<br/>-The island's most ancient borough was [[Newtown, Isle of Wight|Newtown]] on the large natural harbour on the island's north-western coast. A French raid in [[1377]], that destroyed much of the town as well as other Island settlements, sealed its permanent decline.  By the middle of the [[16th century|sixteenth century]] it was a small settlement long eclipsed by the more easily defended town of [[Newport, Isle of Wight|Newport]]. [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] breathed some life into the town by awarding two [[Member of Parliament|parliamentary seats]] but this ultimately made it one of the most notorious of the [[Rotten Borough]]s. By the time of the [[Reform Act 1832|Great Reform Act]] that abolished the seats, it had just fourteen houses and twenty-three voters.  The Act also disenfranchised the boroughs of [[Newport, Isle of Wight|Newport]] and [[Yarmouth, Isle of Wight|Yarmouth]] and replaced the six lost seats with the first MP for the whole Isle of Wight.<br/>-<br/>-===Local Governance===<br/>-<br/>-Often thought of as part of Hampshire, the Isle of Wight was briefly included in that county when the first [[county council]]s were created in [[1888]]. However, a "Home Rule" campaign led to a separate county council being established for the Isle of Wight in [[1890]], and it has remained separate ever since. Like inhabitants of many islands, Islanders are fiercely jealous of their real (or perceived) independence, and confusion over the Island's separate status is a perennial source of friction.<br/>-<br/>-It was planned to merge the county back into Hampshire as a district in the [[1974]] local government reform, but a last minute change led to it retaining its county council.  However, since there was no provision made in the [[Local Government Act 1972]] for [[unitary authority|unitary authorities]], the Island had to retain a two-tier structure, with a county council and two boroughs, [[Medina, England|Medina]] and [[South Wight]].<br/>-<br/>-The borough councils were merged with the county council on [[April 1]], [[1995]], to form a single [[unitary authority]], the [[Isle of Wight Council]]. The only significant present-day administrative link with [[Hampshire]] is the police service, which is joint between Hampshire and the Isle of Wight.<br/>-<br/>-==Westminster Representation==<br/>-<br/>-{{main_article|[[ Isle of Wight (UK Parliament constituency)]]}}<br/>-<br/>-The Isle of Wight forms a single [[constituency]] of the [[House of Commons]], with an electorate of 108,253 ([[as of 2004]]). This is by far the largest electorate in the country, and more than 50% above the England average of 70,026. The [[Boundary Commission]] has considered the possibility of splitting the island into two constituencies, but it was felt that the island would be better represented by a single MP.

Between 1974 and 1987 the seat was a [[The Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] seat, then becoming Conservative until [[1997]] when the Liberal Democrats slipped in on a reduced Conservative vote.

The simultaneous local elections resulted in a Conservative [[Landslide victory|landslide]], and the high turnout and popular Conservative vote in the parliamentary election was likely to be a local sign of dissatisfaction with the incumbent, largely Liberal Democrat Council, as well as reflecting on the national issues. The Labour candidate bucked the national trend and significantly increased the Labour vote to the highest for over 30 years, whilst the UKIP, did not manage to make the breakthrough expected by some, and only slightly increased their vote share.<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-'''Voting Summary:'''<br/>-{| class="wikitable"<br/>-|-<br/>-|style="background-color:#E9E9E9"|Winning Party<br/>-|[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]]<br/>-|bgcolor="blue"| &nbsp;<br/>-|-<br/>-|style="background-color:#E9E9E9"|Majority<br/>-|&nbsp;<br/>-|<br/>-|-<br/>-|style="background-color:#E9E9E9"|Turnout<br/>-|&nbsp;<br/>-|62.4%<br/>-|-<br/>-|style="background-color:#E9E9E9"|Spoilt Ballots<br/>-|&nbsp;<br/>-|270<br/>-|}<br/>-<br/>-===2001 General Election===<br/>-<br/>-In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001]], the incumbent MP, Dr [[Peter Brand]], a Liberal Democrat was ousted by [[Andrew Turner]] of the Conservatives, one of the few constituencies to change hands.

This has been particularly an issue since the closing decades of the [[20th century|twentieth century]] onwards, when it became more economically and technically feasible to undertake such an operation. The continuing debate centres on whether or not such a link is a desirable thing.<br/>-<br/>-The [[Isle of Wight Party]] campaigned from a positive position, although extensive public debate on the subject revealed a strong body of opinion against such a proposal. In [[2002]] the Isle of Wight Council debated the issue and made a policy statement against the proposal.<br/>-<br/>-Arguments in favour of a fixed link tend to concentrate upon the economic benefits that improved communications with the mainland may bring. There is support particularly among young people, which tends to be a form of rebellion against the inevitably parochial culture of the island.<br/>-<br/>-Arguments against a fixed link include the risk to the unique island culture and environment; the risk of losing local distinctiveness, services and facilities to the much larger and economically active south [[Hampshire]] [[conurbation]]; and issues of immigration.<br/>-<br/>-===Autonomy and political recognition===<br/>-<br/>-A number of discussions about the status of the island have taken place over many years, with standpoints from the extreme of wanting full sovereignty for the Isle of Wight, to perhaps the opposite extreme of merging with Hampshire. The pro-independence lobby had a formal voice in the early 1970s with the Vectis National Party. Their main claim was that the sale of the island to the crown in 1293 was unconstitutional (see [[History of the Isle of Wight]]). However, this movement now has little serious support. Since the 1990s the debate has largely taken the form of a campaign to have the Isle of Wight recognized as a distinct region by organizations such as the EU, due to its relative poverty within the south-east of England. One argument in favour of special treatment is that this poverty is not acknowledged by such organizations as it is distorted statistically by retired and wealthy (but less economically active) immigrants from the mainland.<br/>-<br/>-==References==<br/>-*[http://www.ukipiow.org.uk/results.html European Parliamentary Election Results] (N.B.

Stiller is best known for his roles in the films ''[[There's Something About Mary]]'', ''[[Zoolander]]'', ''[[Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story]]'', ''[[Meet the Parents]]'',  and its sequel, ''[[Meet the Fockers]]''.<br/> <br/>-== British origins ==<br/>-Hope was born in [[Eltham, London]], [[England]], the fifth of seven sons. His English father, William Henry Hope, was a [[stonemason]] from [[Weston-super-Mare]] and his [[Wales|Welsh]] mother, Avis Townes, was a [[operetta|light opera]] [[singer]] but later had to find work as a cleaning woman. The family lived in Weston-super-Mare, then Whitehall and St. George in [[Bristol]], before moving to [[Cleveland, Ohio]] in 1907. Hope became a U.S. citizen in 1920 when he was 17.<br/>+==Biography==<br/> <br/>-==Early career==<br/>-From the age of 12, Hope worked at a wide variety of odd jobs at a local board walk. When not doing this he would busk, doing dance and comedy patter to make extra money.  He entered many dancing and amateur talent contests, and won prizes for his impersonation of [[Charlie Chaplin]]. He also [[Boxing|boxed]] briefly and unsuccessfully under the name Packy Easte. Fallen silent film comedian [[Fatty Arbuckle]] saw one of his performances and in [[1925]] got him steady work with Hurley’s Jolly Follies. A year later Hope had formed an act called the Dancemedians with the [[Hilton twins|Hilton Sisters]], conjoined twins who had a tap dancing routine. After five years on the [[Vaudeville]] circuit, by his own account Hope was surprised and humbled when he and his partner Grace Louise Troxell failed a [[1930]] screen test for Pathé in [[Culver City]], [[California]]. Hope returned to [[New York City]] and subsequently appeared in several Broadway [[musical theater|musicals]] including ''[[Roberta]]'', ''[[Say When]]'', the 1936 [[Ziegfeld Follies]] and ''[[Red, Hot and Blue]]'' with [[Ethel Merman]]. His performances were generally well-received and critics noted his keen sense of comedic timing.<br/>+Stiller grew up in [[Manhattan]], the second child of his famous comedy parents, who frequently took him on the sets of their appearances. He displayed an early interest in film making, making [[Super 8 mm film|Super 8]] movies with his sister and friends. At ten years old, he made his acting debut as a guest on his mother's series ''Kate McShane''.<br/> <br/>-== Films ==<br/>-[[Image:BobHopegettingOsca.jpg|161px|thumb|Bob Hope receiving an (honorary) [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]]]<br/>-Hope returned to Hollywood during the mid-1930s but at first was relegated to indifferently produced B-pictures and several [[Short film|one-reel]] comedies for [[Warner Brothers]], however his movie career soon accelerated. In the 1938 film ''[[The Big Broadcast of 1938]]'', during a [[Duet (music)|duet]] with [[Shirley Ross]], Hope introduced the bittersweet song later to become his trademark, "Thanks for the Memory," which became a major hit and was praised by critics. The sentimental and fluid nature of the music allowed Hope's writers (whom he is said to have depended upon heavily throughout his career) to later invent endless variations of the song to fit specific circumstances, such as bidding farewell to [[troop]]s whilst on tour. According to Hope, early during his film career a director advised him that movie acting was done mostly with the eyes, resulting in the exaggerated and rolling eye movements which characterized many of his onscreen performances.<br/>+In 1983, he enrolled as a film student at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. Stiller lasted nine months before dropping out to relocate back to [[New York City]] as he made his way through acting classes, auditioning and trying to find an agent. <br/> <br/>-Hope's regular appearances in Hollywood films and on radio made him one of the best known entertainers in North America and at the height of his career he was also making a large income from [[Concert|live]] performances. For example, during an eight-week tour in 1940 he reportedly generated $100,000 in receipts, a record at the time (this is the equivalent of $1.4 million dollars in 2006 money). <br/>+He landed a role in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] revival of [[John Guare]]'s ''The House of Blue Leaves'', alongside [[John Mahoney]], a play which later garnered four [[Tonys]]. During its run, Stiller produced a satirical [[mockumentary]] whose principal was fellow actor Lil' Bitch. His comedic work was so well received that he followed up with a 10 minute short called "The Hustler of Money," a parody of the [[Martin Scorsese]] film ''[[The Color of Money]]'' featuring him in a send-up of [[Tom Cruise]]'s Vince character and Mahoney in the [[Paul Newman]] role-- only this time as a [[bowling]] hustler instead of a [[pool shark]]. The short got the attention of [[Saturday Night Live]], which aired it in 1987, and two years later offered him a spot as a writer.<br/> <br/>-As a [[movie star]] he was best known for ''[[My Favorite Brunette]]'' and the highly profitable ''[[Road movies|Road To]]'' movies in which he starred with [[Bing Crosby]] and [[Dorothy Lamour]] (whom he had first seen performing as a nightclub singer in New York and subsequently invited to work with him on his [[USO]] tours). Lamour is said to have shown up for filming fully prepared with her lines, only to be baffled by completely new material which had been written by Hope's own staff of writers without the studio's permission. Hope and Lamour  were lifelong friends and she is the actress most associated with his film career along with others such as [[Lucille Ball]], [[Jane Russell]], and [[Katharine Hepburn]]. <br/>+In 1989, Stiller wrote and appeared on a season of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' as a featured performer. He was offered his own vehicle on [[MTV]] as host and performer in a self-titled comedy sketch show, which led to ''[[The Ben Stiller Show]]'' on the [[Fox Network]] in [[1992]]. The show lasted 12 episodes on FOX-- with a thirteenth unaired episode broadcast by [[Comedy Central]] in a later revival. Throughout its short run, the Ben Stiller Show frequently appeared at the bottom of the ratings, even as it garnered critical acclaim, eventually winning the [[Emmy]] for "Outstanding Individual Achievement in Writing in a Variety or Music Program" after it was cancelled. The show also starred (and launched the careers of) his frequent collaborators [[Andy Dick]], [[Janeane Garofalo]], and [[Bob Odenkirk]].<br/> <br/>-He never won any [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]s for his performances but the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] honored him with several special awards and he served as [[Master of Ceremonies|host]] of the Academy Awards ceremony many times beginning in the 1950s and through the 1980s. While hosting one of these presentations he famously quipped that Oscar season was, "as it's known at my house, Passover."<br/>+[[Image: Terrific looking trophy.jpg|thumb|px600|Ben Stiller in [[Happy Gilmore]]]]<br/>+Stiller directed both ''[[Reality Bites]]'' and ''[[The Cable Guy]]'', to generally mixed reviews. Stiller put aside his directing ambitions to star in ''[[There's Something About Mary]]'', which launched Stiller's career into the stratosphere. Another directorial effort, 2001's ''[[Zoolander]]'' was well-received, showing he could be a bankable star both behind the camera as well as in front of it.<br/> <br/>-== Broadcasting ==<br/>-Hope first appeared on television in 1932 during a test transmission from an experimental [[CBS]] studio in New York. His career in [[broadcasting]] spanned sixty-four years and included a long association with [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]]. Hope made his network radio debut in 1937 on NBC. His first regular series for NBC Radio was the ''Woodbury Soap Hour''. A year later he had a show bearing his name, sponsored by [[Pepsodent]] toothpaste. Hope did many specials for the [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]] television network in the following decades and these were often sponsored by [[Texaco]]. Hope's [[Christmas]] specials were popular favorites and wontedly featured a performance of "[[Silver Bells]]" (from his 1951 film ''[[The Lemon Drop Kid]]'') done as a duet with an often much younger female guest star (such as [[Olivia Newton-John]] or [[Brooke Shields]]). His final television special was in 1996 with [[Tony Danza]] helping Hope present a retrospective about presidents of the United States.<br/>+In the parody [[self-help]] book they co-authored, ''Feel This Book'', he and frequent co-star [[Janeane Garofalo]] wrote about, as they put it, their "train wreck of a relationship", but it was done with a tongue-in-cheek style. During much of the [[1990s]], he was involved with actress [[Jeanne Tripplehorn]].<br/> <br/>-==USO==<br/>-<div style="float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;width:227px;text-align:left;">[[Image:Bob hope lackland afb.jpg|Bob Hope, Lackland Air Force Base, 1990]]<br>Bob Hope and golf club, Lackland Air Force Base, 1990<br><sup>Photo: [http://www.af.mil/ www.af.mil]</sup></div><br/>-Hope performed his first [[United Service Organizations]] (USO) show on [[May 6]] [[1941]], at March Field, [[California]].

Hope's USO career lasted half a century, during which he headlined approximately sixty tours.<br/>+Although Stiller is best known for his film roles, in recent years he has made notable cameos in groundbreaking shows such as ''[[Arrested Development]]'' and ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', as well as the British sitcom [[Extras (sitcom)|''Extras'']]. In the latter two programs, Stiller appeared as a twisted version of himself: a Hollywood hotshot who is pithy, childish, and hot-tempered. In ''[[Arrested Development]]'' he took on the role of "Tony Wonder," a bumbling magician. <br/> <br/>-A 1997 act of [[United States Congress|Congress]] signed by [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]] named Hope an “Honorary Veteran”. He remarked, “I've been given many awards in my lifetime - but to be numbered among the men and women I admire most - is the greatest honor I have ever received."<br/>+Among his film credits include a tyrannical nursing home employee in ''[[Happy Gilmore]]'', an evil fitness instructor named [[Tony Perkis]] in ''[[Heavyweights]]'', a put upon attorney in ''[[Zero Effect]]'' and a second rate superhero in ''[[Mystery Men]]''.<br/> <br/>-==Interest in sports==<br/>-Hope had a widely reported passion for sports. He boxed professionally during his youth, was a [[billiards|pool]] hustler, enjoyed watching [[American football|football]] and was at times a part owner of the [[Cleveland Indians]] and [[Los Angeles Rams]]. Hope was also famous for his interest in [[golf]]. He played in a few [[Professional Golfers Association of America|PGA]] tour events and the [[Bob Hope Chrysler Classic]] is named for him. Hope played golf with nearly every [[President of the United States]] from [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] to [[George W. Bush]] and as seen in the accompanying photo, often used a [[golf club (equipment)|golf club]] as an on-stage [[Theatrical properties|prop]]. He appeared in an episode of [[The Simpsons]], "[[Lisa The Beauty Queen]]" as himself, on stage at Fort Springfield. His opening lines were "You know, that [[Mayor Quimby]] is some golfer. His golf balls spend more time underwater than [[Greg Louganis]]."<br/>+==Personal==<br/>+In [[May 2000]], Stiller married [[Christine Taylor]], whom he met while filming a never-broadcast television pilot for the FOX network called ''[[Heat Vision and Jack]]'', starring [[Jack Black (actor)|Jack Black]]. He and Taylor have a daughter, Ella Olivia, born [[April 10]], [[2002]], and a son, Quinlin Dempsey, born [[July 10]], [[2005]].<br/> <br/>-== Marriages and personal life ==<br/>-According to biographer Arthur Marx, son of Hope's long-time professional rival [[Groucho Marx]], Hope's first wife was his vaudeville partner Grace Louise Troxell whom he married on [[January 25]] [[1933]]. When the marriage record was unearthed some years later Hope denied that the marriage had any substance and said they had quickly [[divorce]]d. There were rumours that he fathered a daughter with Troxell and that he continued to send generous checks to her despite a reputation for [[frugality]].{{fact}}<br/>+[[Amy Stiller]], his older sister, is also an actress.<br/> <br/>-Hope married his second wife Dolores DeFina on or about [[February 19]] [[1934]] (no record of the marriage is known to exist). A devoutly [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[The Bronx|Bronx]]-born [[nightclub]] singer of [[Irish people|Irish]] and [[Italian people|Italian]] ancestry, she was known professionally as Dolores Reade and had met Hope two months earlier at The Vogue, a [[Manhattan]] nightclub where she was performing. DeFina and Hope remained together until Hope's death sixty-nine years later, the longest marriage in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] history to date. They [[Adoption|adopted]] four children, all from the same [[orphanage]] in [[Evanston, Illinois]].<br/>+[[Princeton University]]'s Class of [[2005]] inducted Stiller as an honorary member of the class during its "Senior Week" in April 2005.<br/> <br/>-Hope reportedly had many discreet [[adultery|affairs]] (mostly with young actresses including, allegedly, [[Marilyn Monroe]]) and his reputation for frugality was widely documented.[http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=947&id=546292003] [http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/fr/954041/posts]<br/>-[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_19_52/ai_65805919]<br/>-[http://www.cjrdaily.org/blog_report/remembering_reagan.php]<br/>-[http://blogs.citypages.com/amadzine/2003/07/bob_hope_womani.asp]<br/>+In 2005, Stiller admitted to having [[bipolar disorder]], an illness he says runs in his family [http://bipolar.about.com/cs/celebs/a/benstiller.htm].<br/> <br/>-== Later life ==<br/>-Hope lived so long that he suffered [[List of premature obituaries|premature obituaries]] on two separate occasions. In 1998 a prepared obituary by [[The Associated Press]] was inadvertently released on the Internet prompting Hope's death to be announced in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]]. In 2003 he was among several famous figures whose pre-written obituaries were published on [[CNN]]'s web site due to a lapse in password protection.<br/>+==Filmography==<br/> <br/>-Hope celebrated his 100th birthday on [[May 29]] [[2003]] ([[Irving Berlin]] and [[George Burns]] were two other notable entertainment [[centenarian]]s). To mark this event, the intersection of [[Hollywood and Vine]] in [[Los Angeles, California]] was named ''Bob Hope Square'' and his centennial was declared ''Bob Hope Day'' in 35 U.S. states. Hope spent the day privately in his [[Toluca Lake, Los Angeles, California|Toluca Lake]] home where he had lived since 1937. Even at 100 years of age and with failing health, Hope is said to have maintained his self-deprecating sense of humor, quipping "I'm so old, they've canceled my [[blood type]]." He was reported to be worth in excess of one billion dollars, much of which had been made through timely investments in [[Southern California]] [[real estate]]. According to one of Hope's daughters, when asked on his deathbed where he wanted to be buried, he told his wife, "Surprise me." He died two months later of [[pneumonia]] at 9:28 PM [[July 27]] [[2003]] at his home in Toluca Lake, north of Hollywood. He had entertained 11 U.S. presidents.<br/>+{| border="2" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" style="margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;"<br/>+|- bgcolor="#CCCCCC" align="center"<br/>+| '''Year''' || '''Title''' || '''Role''' || '''Other notes''<br/>+|-<br/>+| [[2008 in film|2008]] || ''[[Madagascar 2]]'' || Alex || (voice)<br/>+|-<br/>+|rowspan="2"| [[2007 in film|2007]] || ''[[The Persuaders]]'' || Danny Wilde ||<br/>+|-<br/>+| ''[[Used Guys]]'' || '''Unknown'''<br/>+|-<br/>+|rowspan="5"| [[2006 in film|2006]] || ''Tropic Thunder'' || '''Unknown'''<br/>+|-<br/>+|''[[Night at the Museum]]'' || '''Unknown'''<br/>+|-<br/>+|''In Search of Ted Demme'' || '''Unknown'''<br/>+|-<br/>+|''[[Tenacious D in: The Pick of Destiny]]'' || '''Unknown'''<br/>+|-<br/>+|''[[The Mirror (2006 film)|The Mirror]]'' || '''Unknown'''<br/>+|-<br/>+|rowspan="3"| [[2005 in film|2005]] || ''Danny Roane: First Time Director'' || Ben Stiller || <br/>+|-<br/>+|''[[Madagascar (movie)|Madagascar]]'' || Alex || (voice)<br/>+|-<br/>+|''Sledge: The Untold Story'' || Commander ||<br/>+|-<br/>+|rowspan="6"| [[2004 in film|2004]] || ''[[Meet the Fockers]]'' || Gaylord 'Greg' Focker ||<br/>+|-<br/>+|''[[Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy]]'' || Arturo Mendes ||<br/>+|-<br/>+|''[[Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story]]'' || White Goodman ||<br/>+|-<br/>+|''[[Envy (film)|Envy]]'' || Tim Dingman ||<br/>+|-<br/>+|''[[Starsky & Hutch]]'' || David Starsky ||<br/>+|-<br/>+|''[[Along Came Polly]]'' || Reuben Feffer ||<br/>+|-<br/>+|rowspan="3"| [[2003 in film|2003]] || ''Nobody Knows Anything!'' || Peach Expert || (cameo)<br/>+|-<br/>+|''[[Duplex (movie)|Duplex]]'' || Alex Rose ||<br/>+|-<br/>+|''[[Pauly Shore Is Dead]]'' || Himself || (cameo)<br/>+|-<br/>+|rowspan="2"| [[2002 in film|2002]] || ''[[Orange County (movie)|Orange County]]'' || The Firefighter ||<br/>+|-<br/>+|''[[Run Ronnie Run]]'' || Himself ||<br/>+|-<br/>+|rowspan="2"| [[2001 in film|2001]] || ''[[The Royal Tenenbaums]]'' || Chas Tenenbaum ||<br/>+|-<br/>+|''[[Zoolander]]'' || Derek Zoolander || also Director<br/>+|-<br/>+|rowspan="3"| [[2000 in film|2000]] || ''[[Meet the Parents]]'' || Gaylord 'Greg' Focker ||<br/>+|-<br/>+|''[[Keeping the Faith]]'' || Rabbi Jake Schram ||<br/>+|-<br/>+|''[[The Independent]]'' || Cop ||<br/>+|-<br/>+|rowspan="3"| [[1999 in film|1999]] || ''[[Black and White (movie)|Black and White]]'' || Mark Clear ||<br/>+|-<br/>+|''[[Mystery Men]]'' || Mr. Furious ||<br/>+|-<br/>+|''[[The Suburbans]]'' || Jay Rose ||<br/>+|-<br/>+|rowspan="4"| [[1998 in film|1998]] || ''[[Permanent Midnight]]'' || Jerry Stahl ||<br/>+|-<br/>+|''Your Friends & Neighbors'' || Jerry ||<br/>+|-<br/>+|''[[There's Something About Mary]]'' || Ted Stroehmann ||<br/>+|-<br/>+|''[[Zero Effect]]'' || Steve Arlo ||<br/>+|-<br/>+|rowspan="4"| [[1996 in film|1996]] || ''[[The Cable Guy]]'' || Sam Sweet/Stan Sweet ||<br/>+also Director<br/>+|-<br/>+|''[[Flirting with Disaster]]'' || Mel ||<br/>+|-<br/>+|''If Lucy Fell'' || Bwick Elias ||<br/>+|-<br/>+|''[[Happy Gilmore]]'' || Nursing Home Orderly ||<br/>+|-<br/>+|rowspan="2"| [[1995 in film|1995]] || ''[[Heavyweights]]'' || Tony Perkis/Tony Perkis Sr. ||<br/>+|-<br/>+|''2 stupid dogs'' || Tony Robbins-style character ||<br/>+|-<br/>+| [[1994 in film|1994]] || ''[[Reality Bites]]'' || Michael Grates || also Director<br/>+|-<br/>+|rowspan="2"| [[1992 in film|1992]] || ''The Nutt House'' || Pie Thrower || (cameo)<br/>+|-<br/>+|''[[Highway to Hell]]'' || Pluto's Cook/Attila the Hun ||<br/>+|-<br/>+| [[1990 in film|1990]] || ''[[Stella]]'' || Jim Uptegrove ||<br/>+|-<br/>+|rowspan="3"| [[1989 in film|1989]] || ''Next of Kin'' || Lawrence Isabella ||<br/>+|-<br/>+|''Elvis Stories'' || Bruce ||<br/>+|-<br/>+|''That's Adequate'' || Chip Lane ||<br/>+|-<br/>+| [[1988 in film|1988]] || ''[[Fresh Horses]]'' || Tipton ||<br/>+|-<br/>+|rowspan="3"| [[1987 in film|1987]] || ''[[Empire of the Sun]]'' || Dainty ||<br/>+|-<br/>+|''Hot Pursuit'' || Chris Honeywell ||<br/>+|-<br/>+|''Shoeshine'' || <br/>+|}<br/> <br/>-After the comedian's death, [[Roger Cardinal Mahony]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles|Archbishop of Los Angeles]], confirmed that Hope had converted to Roman Catholicism some years before he died and added that he had died a Catholic in good standing.

This service is called the DPMI host. It is provided either by the host operating system (''virtual DPMI host'') or by 16-bit or 32-bit [[DOS extender|DOS extenders]] such as DOS4GW or CWSDPMI (''real DPMI host'').<br/>-<br/>-The DPMI specification version 0.9 was published in [[1990]] by the DPMI Committee, and it was extended to version 1.0 in [[1991]]. It is available from [[Intel]] Literature Sales. However, version 1.0 was never implemented in Windows so programs have to be written to version 0.9.<br/>-<br/>-===VCPI===<br/>-<br/>-VCPI (Virtual Control Program Interface) was an earlier and incompatible method for doing the same thing. It was limited to 32-bit mode. VCPI was provided by the [[expanded memory]] manager in DOS (e.g. [[CEMM]], [[QEMM]], later [[EMM386]]). It got eclipsed by DPMI, notably because it was not supported for DOS programs run in Windows 3.0's most powerful ''386 enhanced'' mode. It also did not work with [[OS/2]] 2.0 and later. Windows 3.0 only supported VCPI in Standard and Real modes. Earlier Windows/386 2.1 was not compatible with DOS extenders at all.<br/>-<br/>-VCPI also had a more limited scope, in that it basically only allowed a protected mode DOS program to run ''at all'' when such a program was started from DOS already running inside a [[virtual 8086 mode]] task, typically because a [[memory manager]] was installed and operating as a ''virtual [mode] control program'' for the processor. Indeed, because the virtual 8086 mode fully isolates programs from the hardware, without some support from the control program, it is not possible for another program to switch to protected mode by itself.<br/>-<br/>-== External links ==<br/>-<br/>-* [http://clio.rice.edu/cwsdpmi/dpmispec1.pdf DPMI Specification, version 1.0]<br/>-<br/>-''This article was originally based on material from the [[Free On-line Dictionary of Computing]], used with [[Wikipedia:Foldoc license|permission]].

Vague. Trite. Boring to read. Often imprecise. And you can avoid them so easily -- just a few details, a couple of citations make them unneccesary 90% of the time. Why say "some people" when you can say which people? Perhaps "Many believe Brahms to be a great composer," but does a statement like that really belong in a rich, lively, engaging article? In my opinion, no. There are much more interesting things to say about Brahms than that. Perhaps weasel terms are necessary sometimes, but why use them when they aren't? This is an excellent rule of thumb, to be broken when neccesary, as with all style guidelines. <br/>+# [[User:Fubar Obfusco|FOo]] Weasel terms are, almost always, bad and lazy writing. They do serve one useful purpose: they are red flags pointing out where an article needs work! Nothing is "widely believed" or "claimed by many critics" without leaving some record of those beliefs or claims -- and that record can be found and cited. Moreover, we must always be careful of writing "it is thought that" when in fact the only people who think that are the writer and his pals.<br/>+# --[[User:Theodore Kloba|Theodore Kloba]] 15:52, Dec 10, 2004 (UTC) I agree with [[User:Benc|Benc]] that "weasel terms" can be useful temporarily.

Try to avoid that kind of writing if you can. Often I can't and there are cases where these supposed weasel words are the proper thing to use. But throwing this out altogether would be worse. I should be reminded when I am writing such words that there might be a better way, or that such words should be cleansed by being backed up by a reference. Often they can be avoided. Say, for example, "one belief is" instead of "many believe". It seems to me that many voters on both sides here are in fact largely in agreement. What is needed is a better statement.<br/>+# Mhmm.

Could we really not have a fact like the second example until we had enough information to expand it into the third?<br/>+<br/>+I recognize the noble intentions of the writers of this page, but it is an obviously flawed policy and, I believe, one of the sorts of pages Wikipedia's critics would point to when accusing the project of elitism or arrogancy.

The various suggested ways to avoid so-called "weasel" and "peacock" terms are generally turgid and uninformative, and suggest extreme political correctness to avoid saying anything at all.  The New York Yankees example is illustrative, in that the author rejects the statement "one of the greatest teams in baseball" in favor of "one of the most successful teams in baseball."  Both phrases are superlatives, the latter not one whit less subject to interpretation or refutation than the other.  Do we really have to pretend that no superlatives exist, in this insane quest for the tin god NPOV?

Sometimes there's no particular source. You can characterize the people that hold the opinion, like "[[Christian]]s believe Jesus was the Messiah."

Take the Clinton impeachment example -he admitted he had an "improper relationship" with Monica, yet opinions ranged from "So what?" to "He should resign" to "Let´s move on". Writing simply "Clinton admitted an improper relationship and he was fined $..." and so on without saying something about public opinion (which is probably a weasel term) loses a lot. I think the debate wheter he had sex or not with Monica, which was important outside and inside the official procedure would tell a lot to future generations not only about ourselves but about Clinton.<br/>+<br/>+My intended and temporary solution is to add references and try to use weasel words for both sides.

If the editorial community on<br/>+the Wikipedia finds that these statements are accurate, then there is<br/>+no reason not to have them.<br/>+<br/>+Substantiating every single observation running through society with<br/>+specific citations would make the encyclopedia boring and tedious to<br/>+write and read, and, moreover, incomplete -- if a view is very<br/>+widespread, it becomes pointless to list long source citations of<br/>+everyone who holds this view, and it distorts the spirit of the<br/>+statement by making it appear as if ''only'' those listed hold this<br/>+view. At some point, it is only necessary to report on the view<br/>+itself, rather than upon every single person who has ever expressed<br/>+it. When writing about anything related to the arts (an inherently<br/>+subjective area), or indeed, when writing any sentence that is not<br/>+merely reporting on a physical fact, the article text would become<br/>+awkward and overwrought with lengthy, yet incomplete, lists of<br/>+attributions.<br/>+<br/>+Let's look at [[Mona Lisa]] for an example. Taking only a few <br/>+of the many "weasel statements" on that page, we find:<br/>+<br/>+* "It may be the most famous painting in the world" <br/>+* "Few other works of art are so romanticized, celebrated, or reproduced."<br/>+* "The enigmatic 'smile' is the picture's most famous feature..."<br/>+* "Others have described it [the smile] as both innocent and inviting."<br/>+* "The most probable suspect is the wealthy Florentine Madonna Lisa del Giocondo."<br/>+<br/>+According to whom? Many, many people have uttered support for these<br/>+positions. Are we to list them all?<br/>+<br/>+These are all "weasel statements", according to the definitions set<br/>+forth on this page.  80% of the articles in the Wikipedia use<br/>+technically unsubstantiated statements like these, and there is<br/>+nothing at all wrong with that, if the peer review process achieves<br/>+consensus as to their accuracy.<br/>+<br/>+It's tedious and contrived, bordering on absurd, to write articles<br/>+according to the tenets presented on [[Wikipedia:Avoid weasel<br/>+terms]]. I wholeheartedly oppose this page.

The question is whether adding a single layer of redirection is a fair application of a neutral point of view.<br/>+<br/>+:I also don't see any particularly weaselly terms in the Mona Lisa quotes you've called out, with the exception of "Others have described it...". This policy is not the same as requiring people to cite sources; it's a style thing. If a sentence can't stand on its own as without a "Some have said" or "some people think" in front of it, it lacks NPOV, and needs to be better defined. --[[User:EvanProdromou|ESP]] 21:16, 8 Feb 2004 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::Thanks, that cleared things up for me, so I incorporated it into the page. --[[User:Gracefool|gracefool]] 03:49, 9 Jul 2004 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+I think that the policy on weasel terms is overly broad indeed. There happens many times where a certain person or corporation is widely said to have certain positions, but denies it himself. For instance, many people in France contend that the [[TF1]] TV-channel tends to exhibit right-wing bias; but of course, this is very difficult to substantiate precisely, and they won't admit to it. Yet, I think that the fact that many contend that this channel is biased is in itself a good piece of information.

I revised the description to specifically call out some exceptions, and to point out that as with all rules of thumb, it should be balanced against other considerations. I'd love to see some feedback from some detractors. Does including exceptions make this style guideline at least somewhat less worrisome? --[[User:EvanProdromou|ESP]] 01:47, 23 Feb 2004 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:I thought that the addition of a list of exceptions was a good step, but that the article ended up reading a little funny: the beginning seemed to suggest you should never ever do this, then at the end it says it's okay sometimes.  I took the liberty of trying a re-write to incorporate both points of view throughout, softening the point (but hopefully without weaseling out on it; I agree that it's important).  <br/>+<br/>+:By the way, "weasel words" is an okay term in my opinion: it may be a little excessively negative, but at least it's clear and memorable. You don't want the style guide to be so bland no one can stand to read it.<br/>+:''My version has been almost completely removed, pull it out of the Page History if you want to see what we're talking about'' -- 06 Mar 2004 17:16 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:--[[User:doom|doom]] Thu Mar  4 2004, 15:49 (PST)<br/>+<br/>+::So, I kinda worked this out differently.

The designation "weasel term" is, in itself, inappropriate; it imparts negative connotations and stigma to a very common category of phraseology used to express consensus opinions or general knowledge. This category is perfectly acceptable in many, if not most, circumstances in which it is used on Wikipedia. Further, simply saying "Writing weasel sentences like these is bad, except for exceptions in situations A, B, and C" is no good; one cannot possibly list all potentially valid exceptions. (I expect the exceptions would far outnumber "evil" uses of these phrase patterns to avoid NPOV.)<br/>+:This sort of situation defies simple codification that doesn't rapidly devolve into a muddled, arcane mess. Eventually, there will be 10 exceptions, and each will have 10 counter-exceptions, and those will have counter-counter-exceptions, and so on. This is needlessly bureaucratic and complex. We (editors) don't need a document to refer to in order to determine if a sentence is no good. If, in a specific instance, a particular usage of a so-called "weasel term" violates NPOV, then change it. If it doesn't, then leave it. We don't need this policy to find these instances or identify them, but it ''will'' be used to justify the culling legitimate consensus opinions among given groups, and thus reduce the quality and comprehensiveness of the information in the encyclopedia. [[User:Kwertii|Kwertii]] 20:15, 5 Mar 2004 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+::I wholeheartedly agree with you, Kwertii. To lay down any rules about "weaseling", would be a Sisyphean task. As you quite rightly said, one set of rules would lead to a countervailing set of rules, and to what purpose? Having been given this charged expression "weasel" removes it from its real purpose, namely that of being a rhetorical device which makes for an easy smooth style, removes pedantry and repetitiveness. And it just might hit the nail on the head in what it wants to express.<br> The adverbial phrases ''for example'', ''such as'', or ''e.g.'' are precisely such devices. They are all there to save you having to quote every damned one of a sometimes huge number of examples that also belong to that same category you are referring to, but which would make the article you are writing almost unreadable. Thank you for standing up for this rhetorical device called "weasel word". --[[User:Dieter Simon|Dieter Simon]] 00:09, 6 Mar 2004 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+:::Okay, so I'm getting the feeling that what ESP is after here is absolute, objective truth, but this is much harder to achieve than neutrality, which is the real goal that the Wikipedia is based on.<br/>+<br/>+:::Let me repeat the '''War and Peace''' example (it's much like the '''Brahms''', though I thought it read a little clearer). <br/>+<br/>+::::   On the other hand, this sort of terminology can be useful for some purpose, for example when describing the consensus view without inisting that it's the correct view.<br/>+<br/>+::::: "'''War and Peace''' is widely regarded as '''Tolstoy''''s greatest work." <br/>+<br/>+::::   This is almost undisputedly true (and useful to know if you've just become interested in Tolstoy).

I've also been thinking about sentences like <br/>+:'''''The Adventures of Foobar''''' is considered by many to be John Q. Nobody's greatest work.  <br/>+While I agree that we neither need nor want long lists of citations for every sentence, I think it is useful to try to write in ways that hold up both stylistically and factually.  For instance,<br/>+:'''''The Adventures of Foobar''''' is usually considered to be John Q. Nobody's most significant work.  Writing in the ''Oxbridge Dictionary of Literary Snobbiness'', Xerxes Solomon called it "the most important work ever to be published on a Tuesday morning".<br/>+<br/>+The second form informs a reader who has never heard of J.Q. Nobody before that the work is significant and provides an authoritative source where one can find out more.  On other issues, such as "The belief that the Sun revolves around the Earth was practically universal in Europe before the 16th century", simply appending "(''see'' [[heliocentrism]])" would probably suffice (although the actual heliocentrism article could probably use some more sources for reference or further reading).<br/>+<br/>+One difference between Wikipedia and a conventional encyclopedia is that it should not be assumed ''a priori'' that the authors and editors of a Wikipedia article are well-versed in knowledge of the article topic.  It is therefore up to the Wikipedian to demonstrate that, in fact, the article is a fair representation of the topic.  The reader should be able to learn the basics of the subject from the article and other Wikipedia articles linked to it.  External links and references are provided for more in-depth knowledge.  Thus, the Wikipedia writer should back up assertions as much as possible so that the reader is confident that she is getting a well-rounded overview of the topic.  It is a fine line between "stating common knowledge" and "pulling something out of one's [hat]".<br/>+[[User:Gwimpey|Gwimpey]] 01:02, Jul 14, 2004 (UTC)<br/>+<br/>+That last edit wasn't a minor edit.

It is merely a ''opinion'' (dare I say prejudice?) that some people are trying to force down everybody's throat. In fact a good argument can be made that extirpation of the passive voice from one's language reduces its expressiveness and potential for nuance. Of course, not all speakers of a language achieve proper command of all its expressive potential, but should that really be made the norm? Passive voice is e.g. a necessary and very useful component of the scientific language. Yes, that is my Point Of View. If you do not think so, that is Your Point of View. [[:af:Gebruiker:Jcwf]]<br/>+:The passive voice should be avoided. Readability and liveliness are decreased whenever it is used.<br/>+:But on a more serious note: nobody, I hope, seriously advocates completely abolishing the passive voice. (I say this knowing that there will no doubt be ignorant folk who do advocate this.) This is neither possible nor desirable. What is true is that ''indiscriminate'' use of the passive voice hollows out the effectiveness of prose, especially in the common case of a long string of weasel phrasings, lending an air of objectivity to thinly disguised subjectivity. I do agree that the guideline condemns the passive voice a little too baldly (it certainly doesn't ''always'' weaken the effectiveness).<br/>+:As an aside, of course it's POV. What do you expect from a style guideline? An end to [[flame war]]s? It's not an article. You're plainly wrong when you say there's no objective argument that can be made for one piece of grammar being better than another, though. The trick is to lay down what you want to measure "better" by. Subsequently measuring that is probably difficult, but there's no denying that some ways of writing will be better than others, depending on your goal and target audience.

You can consider each half of the sentence separately as a possible use of weasel words: "some people prefer dogs as pets," is a separate clause from "some people prefer cats as pets." The clauses are presented together simply so NPOV is not an issue. The preference is assumed to be between these two common pet categories. Your counter example trying to illustrate that it is content free is a moot point because it removes the context that it is discussing the popularity of the most common types of pets. <br/>+<br/>+:That said, the reason this is still a perfectly valid example, is because it is trying to illustrate that this type of statement does not merit citation. Furthermore, it is ridiculous to propose that statistics has anything to do with this example because we can only guess at the context.

In which case it is a given that these categories are not empty, so the sentence conveys exactly no meaning. This has nothing to do with weasel words; you might as well write "dogs and cats are kept as pets". That some people will prefer one thing and other people another (and yet others like both where the choice is non-exclusive) is a universal constant.<br/>+::''That said, the reason this is still a perfectly valid example, is because it is trying to illustrate that this type of statement does not merit citation.'' These examples are supposed to be illustrative; things you could encounter in actual articles. There is no point to coming up with hypothetical abstractions if they have no conceivable actual instances. I do not dispute it does not merit a citation. Lots of things do not. Not all of them should be in an encyclopedia in the first place.<br/>+::''Furthermore, it is ridiculous to propose that statistics has anything to do with this example because we can only guess at the context.'' I actually guessed at the context as it could appear in an ''actual article'', but your rebuttal is that my guess is ridiculous. Well, that settles that then.

Influenced by [[Restorationism#Jehovah.27s Witnesses|Restorationism]], they believe their faith is a continually improving, imperfect restoration of First Century Christianity. An example in ''[[The Watchtower]]'' states: "It was the 1900-year-old 'faithful and discreet slave,' the old Christian congregation, that was entrusted with this precious Kingdom service ... obedient in its centuries-old commission to be witnesses in the earth ... the matured 'slave' as represented by a remnant now stood ready for new assignments of service."<ref>"The Awake "Faithful and Discreet Slave", ''The Watchtower'', July 15, 1960, p.436.</ref><br/>-They teach that this new assignment occurred in [[1919]]  in fulfillment of scripture. Jehovah's Witnesses feel that true understanding of the scriptures began to be reassembled by [[Charles Taze Russell]] and his associates when they formed a [[Bible]] study group in the [[1870]]s in [[Allegheny, Pennsylvania|Allegheny]], [[Pennsylvania]], and had until then been imperfectly represented since the Great Apostasy by a number of historical Christian groups.<ref>‘The Faithful Slave’ Passes the Test!, ''The Watchtower'' March 1, 2004, p. 13-18.</ref><br/>+{{Euro-royal-stub}}<br/>+{{Germany-noble-stub}}<br/> <br/>-Originally, the "[[Bible Students]]" as they were known in Russell's day, focused their evangelizing work on proclaiming that Christ's Second Presence had begun invisibly in [[1874]]. As part of the dawning of the Millennium, Christ was believed to have been enthroned as King in [[1878]], and the destruction of religious organizations and governments was expected by the year [[1914]], to be followed by the establishment of a world-wide paradise.<ref>''The Watchtower'', January 15, 1892, p. 1355</ref> Though their interpretation of prophetic dates has changed through the years, [[Jehovah's Witnesses#Eschatology|eschatology]] has remained a major focus. Based on their current understanding of Bible [[chronology]], Jehovah's Witnesses have retained the year 1914 but now believe it marked the year for Christ's Second Advent and the beginning of the "[[End_times#Jehovah.27s_Witnesses|End Times]]." They believe that Armageddon is near, which drives the urgency in their preaching work.<br/>+[[Category:Princes|Prussia, Prince Eitel Friederich of]]<br/>+[[Category:1883 births|Prussia, Prince Eitel Friederich of]]<br/>+[[Category:1942 deaths|Prussia, Prince Eitel Friederich of]]<br/>+[[Category:House of Hohenzollern|Prussia, Prince Eitel Friederich of]]<br/> <br/>-Born into a [[Presbyterian]] family, Russell had nearly lost his faith until it was rekindled by contact with some [[Second Adventists]] (one of the spiritual heirs of the [[Millerites]]). Adventist ministers [[Jonas Wendell]], George Storrs and George Stetson were early influences. In [[1876]] Russell met [[Nelson H. Barbour]] and subsequently adopted Barbour's understanding of biblical chronology. Russell provided financial backing for Barbour and became co-editor of Barbour's magazine ''Herald of the Morning''. Breaking with Barbour in [[1879]] over the concept of [[substitutionary atonement]], Russell soon began publishing his own magazine ''Zion's Watch Tower and Herald of Christ's Presence''. Known as "Pastor Russell", he formed a legal entity which developed into the [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania]] in [[1881]], and in [[1884]] it was incorporated with Russell as president. Over several years, many millions of copies of ''Zion's Watch Tower and Herald of Christ's Presence'' were distributed in several languages to proclaim Christ's presence and the dawn of his Millennium. In addition, his six-volume work, originally entitled ''Millennial Dawn'' but later changed to ''Studies in the Scriptures'', established the fundamental doctrines derived from their Bible study. (As a consequence, the [[Bible Students]] were sometimes called "Millennial Dawnists".) In [[1914]] Russell founded the [[International Bible Students Association]] in [[Great Britain]].<br/>-<br/>-Russell died in [[1916]], and in the following year, the movement was divided by schisms due to significant [[Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses#Development of Doctrine|doctrinal changes]]. Those who rejected the changes in organization and doctrine became known as the [[Associated Bible Students]], referring to themselves as simply "[[Bible Students]]" to this day. In [[1918]], a Bible Student convention was held independently of the Watchtower Society. At the second convention, a few months later, the [[Pastoral Bible Institute]] was founded and began publishing ''The Herald of Christ's Kingdom''. The magazine continues to be published today. By 1928, memorial attendance dropped nearly 75%  from 1922, from changes put in place by Pastor Russell´s successor, [[Joseph Franklin Rutherford]], and failed predictions around 1925.<ref>''Apocalypse Delayed - The Story of Jehovah's Witnesses'' James M. Penton 1985.</ref><br/>-<br/>-In [[1931]], while Russell's successor, Joseph Franklin Rutherford (often referred to as "Judge Rutherford"), was president of the Watch Tower Society, those who maintained their association with the Society adopted the name "Jehovah's Witnesses", based on [[book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 43:10 ([[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures|NWT]]) which reads, in part: "'You are my witnesses,' is the utterance of Jehovah..."<br/>-<br/>-Under Rutherford, Jehovah's Witnesses experienced rapid growth. Rutherford was known for bold rhetoric. In his preaching, he coined the phrase "Religion is a snare and a racket," heavily denouncing the [[Catholic Church]] and [[Christendom]] generally, modern [[Judaism]] and national governments. Under his leadership, the Society developed a legal staff (which is utilized to this day), and battled successfully in US and Canadian courts to establish their rights to preach their religion. These legal battles resulted in significant improvements in freedom of speech and religion in the laws of both countries. (See, e.g., ''[[Cantwell v. State of Connecticut]]'', ''[[Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire]]'', ''[[West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette]]''.)<br/>-<br/>-[[Nathan Homer Knorr]] became president of the Watch Tower Society after Rutherford's death in [[1942]]. Known as an efficient administrator, Knorr emphasized ministerial training in the local congregations and also founded the [[Gilead_school|Watchtower Bible School of Gilead]] for training missionaries. Knorr's Vice-President [[Frederick William Franz]] became the chief theologian for the Witnesses and was credited as being the principal translator of the ''[[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures]].'' Witness membership rose from 115,000 to over 2 million under Knorr's leadership.<br/>-<br/>-The leadership of Jehovah's Witnesses was reorganized in 1975 and the power of the presidency passed on to the [[Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses#The Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses|Governing Body]]. Subsequent presidents of the Watch Tower Society after Knorr's death in 1977 have been [[Frederick William Franz]], [[Milton George Henschel]] and [[Don A. Adams]]. However, doctrinal and organizational decisions since 1975 have been made by the Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses.<ref>''1977 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses'', p. 258</ref><br/>-<br/>-== Membership ==<br/>-As of August 2005, Jehovah's Witnesses have a practicing membership of more than 6.6 million, according to data reported in the '''Annual Worldwide Statistics ''' at the [http://www.jw-media.org/people/statistics.htm Authorized Site of the Office of Public Information of Jehovah's Witnesses]. The site states: "While other religious groups count their membership by occasional or annual attendance, this figure reflects only those who are actively involved in the public Bible educational work." Jehovah's Witnesses have a custom of counting their membership by 'Lands' rather than by countries, indicating separate statistics for regions administered by other countries, such as Alaska, Hawaii, and Taiwan. A comparison of the 2004 and 2005 statistics indicates a decline in the number of Bible studies, baptisms, Memorial attendance and time spent in the preaching work, but an overall increase in the peak membership of 1.3 percent.  Over time, these numbers can be seen to fluctuate slightly, rather than steadily increase from one year to the next. Though these figures provide a wealth of data, they only give a random indication of the movement's state of development. Longitudinal changes over extended periods of time are presented [http://home.zonnet.nl/rsingelenberg/stats-e.htm here].<br/>-  <br/>-These statistics are based on the number of "active members". To be classed as an active member (or [[Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses#Publishers|publisher]]), an individual who has first been approved as a publisher must serve at least one hour per month in the preaching work, or 15 minutes per month for elderly members and those otherwise physically restricted. Figures for time spent per month are reported by each publisher and submitted monthly to the Society.  In 2005, these reports indicated a total of nearly 1.3 billion hours. <ref>''The Watchtower'', February 1, 2006, p. 27-30.

"Section 1: Population," ''Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2003.'' (Table 79, page 67).

In 1990, a larger but less detailed telephone survey based study (NSRI) at CUNY reported 1.38 million adults in the U.S. who self-identified as Jehovah's Witnesses. While this might indicate a slow decline in U.S. identification with the group, there was an increase in active U.S. publishers over this period. ARIS notes the survey did not cover non-English speakers and small groups with a high proportion of recent immigrant members were likely undercounted. Announced U.S. Witness convention schedules for 2005 include 75 non-English conventions of 227 total.  Most increase in membership each year is due to an influx of non-English speaking individuals, with a rapid increase in foreign-language congregations being established throughout the country.<br/>-<br/>-Jehovah's Witnesses have a small active presence in most countries and are the second or third largest religious group in many countries with a dominant religion. In no country are they a large part of the population, however. [[Brazil]] and [[Mexico]] are the only countries other than the U.S. where the number of active Witness publishers exceeds 0.5 million. The highest proportion of Witnesses in a country of substantial size is in Zambia, where 1% are active Witness publishers. Growth in most developed countries is slow or negative in recent years but is offset by rapid growth in less developed lands, particularly the former Communist bloc and Latin America.<br/>-<br/>-Jehovah's Witnesses commemorate the [[Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses#Memorial of Christ's Death|Memorial of Christ's death]] (also known as the [[Lord's Evening Meal]]) annually. According to the February 1, 2006 ''[[Watchtower]]'', worldwide attendance at the [[2005]] celebration of the Memorial was 16,383,333, slightly lower than the [[2004]] attendance of 16,760,607. This figure includes not only publishers, but inactive members, relatives, visitors and interested persons. In the U.S., 2.3 million people were present. In Zambia 570,000 attended, or 1 person for every 20 in the population. Of over 16 million in attendance worldwide, only 8,524 persons partook of the memorial emblems of unleavened bread and wine.

Jehovah's Witnesses believe the role of the Governing Body corresponds to that of those who met in the Council of Jerusalem, guided by [[Holy Spirit]] and directed by Jesus. The description of the [[Council of Jerusalem]] in the [[Acts of the Apostles]] is often used as an example of how God had a "visible organization" in the first century. From this they reason that God therefore has an organization today. This top-down leadership is referred to by the Witnesses as "theocratic".<br/>-<br/>-All members of the Governing Body profess to be "[[Faithful and Discreet Slave|anointed]]" (see [[Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses#Salvation|Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses]]). The number of men who make up the Governing Body has ranged from ten to seventeen. Since April 1975, the Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses makes decisions by a two-thirds majority vote;  previously a unanimous vote was required. Therefore, no one member makes decisions nor asserts any more spiritual insight than any other member of the Governing Body.<ref>''Crisis of Conscience'' Raymond Franz 1983 pp. 45, 85, 163</ref> The Governing Body (indirectly through the departments of its various legal organizations) directs the operation of the 111 branches spread throughout the world.<ref>{{Web reference| author=Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society |publishyear=2005| title=Membership and Publishing Statistics | url=http://www.jw-media.org/people/statistics.htm| work=Authorized Site of the Office of Public Information of Jehovah's Witnesses | date=December 4| year=2005}}</ref> Each branch has appointed circuit overseers who travel among various local congregations, spending a week with each and giving spiritual encouragement through talks and one-on-one time spent with members in their public ministry. Within each local congregation, appointed elders organize the congregation's public ministry, and the content and schedule of their five weekly meetings, based on publications and precedents set by the Governing Body. They also recommend, via a vote of the elder body, "spiritually mature" baptized male members of the congregation for the positions of elder or ministerial servant, requiring the approval of higher leadership. <br/>-<br/>-Elders take the lead in congregational matters, particularly in religious instruction and spiritual counseling, whereas the ministerial servants assist elders in a limited administrative capacity, and they (the elders and ministerial servants) and other Witnesses 'in good standing' often perform the majority of operational tasks for congregation meetings.<br/>-<br/>-Witnesses do not consider elders to be clergy, though their service includes pastoral activity that clergy provide in other Christian denominations. All baptized Witnesses are considered to be ordained ministers, and are obligated to provide religious instruction to others. Spiritually mature Witnesses (men and women alike) are exhorted to the counseling of less-mature Witnesses. They may be assigned a newer publisher to assist in ministry, and may be asked to conduct a personal Bible study with another Witness who is spiritually troubled or "weak". Males are encouraged to reach out for 'privileges of service' such as becoming elders. Elders are said to be worthy of "double honor", but are held to a higher standard as overseers than other baptized "publishers", and are subject to additional discipline including removal. An elder may also be removed, or choose to step aside willingly, from his position if members of his household are not in "good standing" or for other, sometimes personal, reasons.<br/>-<br/>-About 8,500 other Jehovah's Witnesses profess to be [[Faithful and Discreet Slave|anointed]] but they have no formal role in establishment or modification of the doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses. Unless appointed into one of the various roles described above, they have no position of leadership or authority. Women who profess to be [[Faithful and Discreet Slave|anointed]] cannot attain any position of earthly authority. However, Witnesses do believe that since 1918 all [[Faithful and Discreet Slave|anointed]] who have died faithful (including many women) have been resurrected to heaven to serve as 'kings and priests' over other creatures.<br/>-<br/>-==Beliefs and doctrines==  <br/>-{{main|Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses}} <br/>-  <br/>-Jehovah's Witnesses claim reliance on the Bible for their theology and that it forms the basis for their beliefs.

[http://www.ajwrb.org/2003WThealthcaredocs.pdf (2003 Guide to Our Three Health Care Documents, p. 11)] The conscience of some Witnesses still does not permit the use of fractions derived from blood and these will use non-blood alternatives with varying degrees of success. <br/>-<br/>-The refusal of blood transfusions is a significant issue among medical professionals and others concerning Jehovah's Witnesses, especially when it involves minor children and more so in view of the fact that children of Jehovah's Witnesses have died as a consequence. In some countries, laws may impose limitations on physicians on the ability to withhold or withdraw blood transfusions or blood therapy from minors, particularly in life-threatening situations; parents who have prevented children under their care from receiving blood therapy in life-threatening situations may face prosecution. Courts have ordered transfusions for some children, often the very young; in other cases they have respected the declared choice of an under-age minor who is able to defend his or her own beliefs to the court in a manner that reflects a mature understanding and without undue influence from the parents.<br/>-<br/>-Pursuit of medical alternatives to blood transfusion in cases involving Jehovah's Witness patients, including the use of [[erythropoietin]] to boost the red blood cell count, has afforded opportunities for medical advancement in the field of bloodless surgery.<ref>"Jehovah's Witnesses Instrumental in Heart Surgery Advance," ''Awake!''

Meetings are held in local [[Kingdom Hall]]s and private homes. Larger conventions are held usually three times a year in facilities owned or maintained by the Watchtower Society or rented, such as stadiums or auditoriums. Throughout the week, there are also meetings for "field service" (preaching work) where members meet either in homes, or the Kingdom Hall, to organize and pray prior to engaging in door-to-door or other forms of evangelism. On a daily basis, Jehovah's Witnesses are encouraged to meditate on spiritual matters, often by aids such as ''Examining the Scriptures Daily,'' a booklet with a scripture from the Bible and commentary usually based on a ''[[Watchtower]]'' article. Before meals, Jehovah's Witnesses commonly say a prayer, either silently when alone or aloud when at a gathering. <br/>-<br/>-Aside from their worship practices, Jehovah's Witnesses are identifiable by things from which they abstain. There is a general avoidance of practices considered to have nationalistic or "false religious" roots. These can be such things as singing the national anthem at sporting events, or not saying "bless you" when someone sneezes. They avoid celebrations of birthdays and holidays. Their only officially mandated celebration is the "[[Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses#Memorial of Christ's Death|Memorial of Christ's Death]]." Weddings, anniversaries, and memorials at death are also optionally observed. Adhering to these standards of behavior, Jehovah's Witnesses believe themselves to be faithful even in the seemingly small things (see Luke 16:10). The use of distinctive titles in address (such as Father, Pastor, Elder, Reverend, etc. among other groups) is strictly avoided (Matthew 23:6-12). All Witnesses, irrespective of privileges of service, address one another as "Brother" or "Sister", often followed by the first or last name of the individual. There are categories of privileges of service (Pioneer, Elder, Presiding Overseer, and so on) which may be used to refer to an individual in reference to those duties ("John is an elder"), but never as a title or to address him or her ("elder John").<br/>-<br/>-===Morality===<br/>-<br/>-Their view of sexual behavior reflects conservative Christian views, such as pre-marital sex and homosexual acts as being violations of God's law. "Modesty" is heavily encouraged in daily dress, especially at spiritual events, where standards of dress are more formal, varying by country and regional custom (In the U.S., Europe, and most of Asia, this typically consists of formal western business attire). In addition, entertainment with [[sexuality|sexual]], [[Economic materialism|materialistic]], [[spiritualism|spiritualistic]] or violent subject matter is strongly discouraged. Further, though they are nonconformists in some ways, they seek not to appear to be "[[counter-cultural]]." They avoid presenting an image that might appear unkempt or unprofessional according to local culture and societal norms. Therefore, in certain areas, styles or attributes such as beards, long hair or earrings for men, or any dress or grooming for both men and women that is defined by them to appear "rebellious" or "immodest" are seriously discouraged, even outside of spiritual activities. A person violating these standards would risk providing a "bad witness," and would fail to mark him or herself as different from the secular and "false religious" world. This is in keeping with their interpretation of the scriptural admonition at 2 Timothy 2:9,10 ([[New World Translation|NWT]]), "Likewise I desire the women to adorn themselves in well-arranged dress, with modesty and soundness of mind, not with styles of hair braiding and gold or pearls or very expensive garb, but in the way that befits women professing to reverence God, namely, through good works." Jehovah's Witnesses consider this admonition to apply, in principle, equally to men and to women.<br/>-<br/>-===Construction and Humanitarian Efforts===<br/>-<br/>-Jehovah's Witnesses are known in many lands for their building work. International and regional building teams frequently undertake so-called "quick builds," construction of Kingdom Halls over the course of one or two weekends. Larger construction projects, including the building of regional Assembly Halls and Bethel offices, factories, residences, warehouses, and farm facilities, are also carried out almost entirely by volunteer members.<br/>-<br/>-The Witnesses are noted for their racial and ethnic integration. In the United States an academic study (ARIS 2001) by CUNY put the proportion of blacks among adults who self-identified as Witnesses at 37% (the highest proportion among any of the 22 largest religious identifications which make up 90% of the U.S. population). Congregations are generally organized geographically, and members are encouraged to attend the Kingdom Hall in whose territory they reside, resulting in an ethnic mix generally representative of local population. Anecdotal accounts of Witness outreach across racial lines are a common subject matter for the annual ''Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses''. A notable example is the account of relief efforts to both Hutu and Tutsi Witnesses and non-Witnesses during the genocide in Rwanda and to Congo refugees. "Since 1994, Jehovah's Witnesses in Europe alone have sent more than 190 tons of food, clothing, medicine, and other relief supplies to the Great Lakes region of Africa." This humanitarian aid was not given exclusively to Jehovah's Witnesses. Others also benefited. For instance, the Witnesses distributed medicine and clothing to several primary schools and an orphanage near Goma.<ref>"Christianity in Action: Amid Turmoil", ''The Watchtower'', Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania (January 15).

The Watch Tower Society from the days of [[Joseph Franklin Rutherford]] has utilized the court systems of various countries to defend religious freedoms. In addition, they have occasionally organized letter-writing campaigns to protest "persecutions", most famously those addressed to Adolf Hitler during the second world war and certain African nations during the 1970s. (See the publication ''Defending and Legally Establishing the Good News'' for examples.)<br/>-<br/>-According to the book ''Judging Jehovah's Witnesses'' (Shawn Francis Peters, University Press of Kansas: 2000), the Witnesses have helped to widen the definition of civil liberties in most western societies, hence broadening the rights of millions of people, due to their firm stand and determination. According to the preface to the book ''State and Salvation'' (William Kaplan, University of Toronto Press: 1989): "One of the results of the Witnesses' legal battles was the long process of discussion and debate that led to the [[Charter of Rights]], which is now part of the fundamental law of Canada. Other battles in countries around the world have involved the rights to decline military service or martial arts training, to decline to participate in political parties or governmental elections, to exercise free and anonymous speech, to exercise freedom of association, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, medical self-determination, etc. Witnesses continue to, in their words, 'defend and legally establish the Good News' around the world."  See the article [[Jehovah's Witnesses and governments]].<br/>-<br/>-Jehovah's Witnesses endured intense persecution under the Nazi regime from 1933 to 1945, both as a religious group and individually. Unlike Jews, Sinti and Roma ("Gypsies"), persecuted and killed by virtue of their culture, Jehovah's Witnesses had the opportunity to escape persecution and personal harm by renouncing their religious beliefs. The courage the vast majority displayed in refusing to do so, in the face of torture, maltreatment in concentration camps, and sometimes execution, won them the respect of many contemporaries. These events are recounted in a documentary entitled Purple Triangles.<ref>{{Cite video | People=Martin Smith (Director) | ReleaseYear=1991 | Title=[http://imdb.com/title/tt0162577/maindetails Purple Triangles] | Medium=Movie | DistributorsLocation=United States of America | DistributorsName= Watchtower Bible & Tract Society}}</ref> There is now a second documentry also available conserning this subject.[http://www.ushmm.org/education/resource/jehovahs/jehovahsw.php?menu=/export/home/www/doc_root/education/foreducators/include/menu.txt&bgcolor=CD9544 United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]<br/>-<br/>-== Opposition to Jehovah's Witnesses ==    <br/>-{{main|Opposition to Jehovah's Witnesses}}<br/>-<br/>-Throughout their history, their beliefs, doctrines and practices have met controversy and opposition from governments, communities, and religious groups. Many Christian denominations consider the interpretation and doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses to be [[heresy]]. In addition, governments of various political persuasions have considered the religion to be a subversive organization, and sometimes even a threat to national security.<br/>-<br/>-Political and religious animosity against them has at times led to [[mob action]] and [[government]] oppression.<br/>-<br/>-On the milder side, there have been opposition by locals to the building of facilities (such as Kingdom Halls), and the holding of large conventions. In those circumstances, at times the reason is opposition to the religion, but at other times, they are more mundane, such as concerns about traffic congestion and noise. In some legal cases, (such as ''Congrégation des témoins de Jéhovah de St-Jérôme-Lafontaine v. Lafontaine (Village)''), disputes that have actually been about appropriate land use have been claimed by the Witnesses to be a violation of their religious freedoms.<br/>-<br/>-See also [[Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses]].<br/>-<br/>-==Eschatology==<br/>-{{main|Eschatology of Jehovah's Witnesses}}<br/>-<br/>-Since their formation in the 1870s, leaders of the organization have sought to identify dates for end-time events such as the enthronement of Jesus as King, the return of Jesus Christ, and for the "end of this system of things," culminating in [[Armageddon]]. The Witness publication ''Jehovah's Witnesses--Proclaimers of God's Kingdom'', gives an overview of some of the historical development of the Witnesses' [[eschatology]]. However, no detailed study by Witness historians has been published. Most information on Jehovah's Witnesses' eschatology has been produced by non-Witnesses citing Watch Tower publications. Responding to the charge of being "false prophets," the Watchtower Society has defended failed predictions, and eschatology changes, as incorrect interpretations of the Bible and views it as evidence that they have been "keeping on the watch" for the "Day of Jehovah." <br/>-<br/>-While their understanding of eschatology has changed over the years, the Watchtower Society has spoken with complete assurance of their interpretation. Regarding the eschatology they held to in the early 1920's, the ''Watchtower'' said: "It is on the basis of such and so many correspondences-in accordance with the soundest laws known to science that we affirm that, Scripturally, scientifically, and historically, present-truth chronology is correct beyond a doubt.

''Watch Tower'' March 1, 1922</ref> Soon after the 1874 disappointment, Barbour accepted the idea that Christ had actually returned to the earth in 1874, but invisibly. [[1874]] was considered the end of 6,000 years of human history and the beginning of judgment by Christ. [[Charles Taze Russell]] and the group that later was known as [[Bible Students]] accepted these views from Barbour.  Russell taught that while Jesus was invisibly present here on earth, he was made its King in 1878. Rejected by God in 1878 was the "nominal Church" (considered to be "Babylon the Great").<ref>"This spuing out, or casting off, of the nominal church as an organization in 1878, we then understood, and still proclaim, to be the date of the commencement of Babylon's fall..."--''Zion's Watch Tower'', April 1883.

(As each of the remainder of the 144,000 would die after 1878, Christ would resurrect them as spirit beings to join those already resurrected.)

The length of time is indicated by him when he said, 'Truly I say to you that this generation will by no means pass away until all these things occur.' (Matt. 24:34, NW) The actual meaning of these words is, beyond question, that which takes a 'generation' in the ordinary sense, as at Mark 8:12 and Acts 13:36, or for those who are living at the given period. So it was on 'this generation' that the accumulated judgments were to fall. (Matt. 23:36) This therefore means that from 1914 a generation shall not pass till all is fulfilled, and amidst a great time of trouble.

Such as the addition of Forward-B moves, full 4-directional Smashing, side-step, dodge, etc.  And then I was also wondering if we should make a section within the moves area for a pseudo-moves section for things such as wave-dashing and DI.  These moves are real and very legitimate moves used by most players of the game today, but never officially mentioned as part of technique listings for skill in the game, along with skills such as Teching and L-Cancelling.  If you think that this would be a good idea, I would certainly not mind approaching it very professionally and contributing what I can, because I have an extremely deep knowledge of these things, including frames and such.

It is equaly unlikely that they will take out a character that has represented their series/subseries in a previous Smash.  Despite all this though, it is a trailer, which means it does not necessarily represent actual gameplay.  I can guarentee, though, that Yoshi is in.
