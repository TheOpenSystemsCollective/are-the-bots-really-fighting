He has published numerous essays, articles, books, and scholarly theses related to these and other Cold War and post-Cold War era subjects. <br/>+When there is an active discussion over a section occuring within an article's talk page (in this case, the opening paragraph), it is advised that no edits which fall into the remit of this discussion be made.

After graduating from [[Columbia University]] in 1962, Jowitt pursued post-graduate and doctoral studies at the University of California-Berkeley, earning his Master's in 1963 and his doctorate in 1970.  Jowitt also spent some of his post-graduate life in [[Romania]] during the [[Nicolae Ceauşescu|Ceauşescu]] regime, where he studied the political and cultural dynamics of post-Stalinist Communist Europe. <br/>+== [[:Image:MuhammadSeal.jpg]] ==<br/> <br/>-He has been a professor at UC-Berkeley since 1968. Among other honors and forms of recognition, he won the University Distinguished Teaching Award in 1983, and has been the recipient of two Stanford Hoover fellowships. From 1983 to 1986 he was dean of undergraduate studies at his [[alma mater]], the University of California-Berkeley. <br/>+thank you. i have responded.

The last three essays argue against a popular early 90s philosophy that espoused Western triumphalism, and the essays dispute the "end of history" theory propounded at the time by former [[neoconservative]] scholars such as [[Francis Fukayama]].<br/>+== Why take our Moses? ==<br/>+Why you are taking out Moses from Muhammad article?

I try to do the same thing myself, and although I have been especially working on Hinduism-related articles, I have noticed your good work on articles like Islam. Much of what I do on wikipedia is trying to promote NPOV in all articles. So I'm quite open to criticism.  I trust that you too, since you seem reasonable and committed to quality, are open to suggestions. Here are two I would make, and I hope you take them in the spirit of helpfulness I mean them to have.<br/>+#Try to keep a friendly tone. People will typically have a better reaction to your edits if you say "Perhaps we should change x to y in order to make it clearer and NPOV," rather than "Whoever made this edit ought to be dragged out into the street and shot without a chance to say their prayers!" (Of course I'm exaggerating, and you didn't say anything quite so extreme).<br/>+#Be careful not to "throw the baby out with the bathwater."  Remember that it is always easier to delete than to draft new material. In general, I think it is better not to delete material unless I have something better to replace it with. In some cases, it may be better to replace it with nothing. But in many cases if you just delete a lot of material, the section of the article will cease to be coherent. So consider not only the sentences themselves, but also how they interact with the rest of the article. Ask yourself, "if I delete this section, will it leave important questions unanswered in the mind of the reader?"<br/>+<br/>+Well, these are just my thoughts. Thanks for all your hard work on all the articles you've improved! Happy editing ! By the way, although I am a Hindu, I will defend you if anybody challenges your right to contribute simply becasue you are not Hindu. Some have suggested that non-Hindu editors be screened out. Such a view is wrong. There is no requirement that you belong to a certain religion in order to edit any article.

What I will try to do is collect some stories as recorded from historical books. I understand that WikiPedia is to document and collect what is written by others. This Hadith mentioned here is really used and argued not by TruthSpreader, but is used by many authors to explain the story. I think this should be made more accurate as you suggested. It should not be implied that any of us is concluding this, but it is what the Scholars generally concluded. This article is quite poor when compared to a good documentation of the story that usually requires several book pages. Anyway, I understand tottaly what you say here. I will work on this story as it need more attention. Finally, I am not sure about that Hadith you sent me, I do not see why it should or should not be included. If it is a true Hadith, I mean its degree is strong and authentic, then it should be discussed in whatever article. I do not see why not.

There are various aspects of this. All Hadiths have been assigned a degree of truth based on their narrator sequence and other issues. Unless the Hadith is weak or rejected, because some are, it should be used. It is well known that there are many occasions when a Hadith has been falsely connected to Muhammad. Anyway, I think that is an issue you can resolve at other article. If you need my help, please let me know if I can offer anything. I do have a quite good database to verify any Hadith mostly. There are also a bunch of them on the Web. In any case, please let me know. But again, I basicly do not see any reason to exclude a Hadith particularly if it is ranked Sahih by experts. If you want, I may look up the Gekos one for you. If it is ranked high, then it should be there in the article.

Poor throughout his youth, he was handsomely rewarded for his diligence as a prospector with the discovery of the famous Humbug mine in the [[Tintic Mining District]] near [[Eureka, Utah|Eureka]], [[Utah]] in [[1886]]. As the Humbug proved profitable, he acquired other mines in the vicinity, including the Uncle Sam, Beck Tunnel, Iron Blossom, and Colorado.  After making his fortune, Knight went on to found the LDS settlement of [[Raymond, Alberta]], [[Canada]].<br/> <br/>-*Nouns have grammatical gender, number, and are declined for 7 cases;<br/>-*Adjectives agree with the noun in case, number, and gender;<br/>-*Verbs have 2 aspects, 3 tenses, 3 moods, and 2 voices.<br/>+Knight is significant in western mining and entrepreneurial history because in several important ways he differed from the typical "[[robber baron (industrialist)|robber baron]]" capitalists of the late-nineteenth century [[Gilded Age]]. His success, like theirs, depended upon the skillful acquisition and management of such business variables as claims, labor, capital, technology, and government services, and also upon the development of cost-efficient integrated enterprises, such as the Knight Investment Company. However, he also owned more patented mining claims in the [[Intermountain West]] than did his counterparts, and he was not inclined to engage in stock manipulation like many other mining entrepreneurs and railroad barons. Moreover, his business methods, especially when dealing with his working men, were far more paternalistic and benevolent than those of the typical big businessmen of the era. While other company town and mine owners often exploited their workers, Knight treated his workers very fairly in his company town of [[Knightville, Utah]], which he equipped with a meetinghouse, amusement hall, and school instead of the usual hedonistic establishments of mining camp life. <br/> <br/>-Furthermore, many verbs show traces of Indo-European gradation ([[ablaut]]). This often explains the difference between the infinitive and its present root form of the verbs.<br/>+Although Knight's [[philanthropy]] was not unique for the period, his generous gifts to [[Brigham Young University]] (an interest he shared with his wife, Amanda) earned him the reputation as the "patron saint" of BYU. He also gave freely to the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] and to many church-related projects, thereby revealing a kindly, religiously motivated disposition. Furthermore, his comfortable but unostentatious home in [[Provo, Utah]], did not rival the extravagantly garish mansions built by big businessmen from [[San Francisco]]'s [[Nob Hill]] to [[New York City|New York]]'s [[Fifth Avenue (Manhattan)|Fifth Avenue]]. Nor did he seek high political office like mining kings [[George Hearst]], [[James Graham Fair|James Fair]], [[William Sharon]], [[John P. Jones]], [[Nathaniel P. Hill|Nathaniel Hill]], [[Jerome B. Chaffee]], [[Horace Tabor]], [[William Andrews Clark|William Clark]], or Utah's [[Thomas Kearns]]—all of whom served in the "millionaire's club" of the [[United States Senate]].  <br/> <br/>-The spoken language has been influenced by the literary, but continues to preserve characteristic forms.  The dialects show various non-standard grammatical features, some of which are archaisms or descendants of old forms since discarded by the literary language.<br/>+Essentially more sensitive and modest than most business leaders during this age of ruthless capitalism and conspicuous consumption, he probably deserved the endearing nickname of "Uncle Jesse"—a rich but giving uncle. In fact, he believed that his money was for the purpose of doing good and building up his church; he regarded the matter as a "trusted stewardship." As he once said, "The earth is the Lord's bank, and no man has a right to take money out of that bank and use it extravagantly upon himself." Few nabobs of the era would have been willing to make that statement. Although he strayed from the LDS Church in his early years and briefly affiliated with the anti-Mormon [[Liberal Party (Utah)|Liberal Party]] in Utah, one must assume that his otherwise devout faith helped prevent him from falling prey to the capitalistic corruption and self-indulgent excesses so tempting and common to the business leaders of the Gilded Age and the western mining industry.<br/> <br/>-'''Note 1''':  For an introductory overview, please see the discussion in the [[Ukrainian language#Grammar|Ukrainian language]] article.<br/>+After making his fortune in mining, Knight went on to develop settlement and industry in what is today southern [[Alberta]].  In [[1901]], Knight purchased 30,000 acres of land in Canada's [[Northwest Territories]] for $2.50 per acre.  On this property he established a ranch; Knight later went on to acquire another 226,000 acres of land near his ranch and established a town built around [[irrigation|irrigation farming]] of [[sugar beets]], which were then processed in a local [[sugar]] factory that Knight built. The settlement was named ''Raymond'' in honor of his son, [[Raymond Knight]].  Within five years, over 1,500 Latter-day Saints—mostly from Utah—had immigrated to Raymond.  The town incorporated in [[1903]], and today Knight is honored as the founder of [[Raymond, Alberta]].<br/> <br/>-'''Note 2''': In the discussion below, various terms are used in the meaning they have in the standard Ukrainian discussions of historical grammar.  In particular, [[aorist]], [[imperfect tense|imperfect]], etc. are considered verbal [[tense]]s rather than [[grammatical aspect|aspects]], because ancient examples of them are attested for both perfective and imperfective verbs.<br/>+'''Sources'''<br/> <br/>-'''Note 3''': [[Cyrillic]] letters in this article are [[romanized]] using [[scientific transliteration]]<br/>+Peterson, Richard H., Utah History Encyclopedia, http://www.media.utah.edu/UHE/k/KNIGHT,JESSE.html<br/> <br/>-==Phonology==<br/>-The following points of Ukrainian phonology need to considered in order to understand the various changes that occur in the declension of nouns.<br/>-===Classification of Vowels===<br/>-Two different classifiction of vowels can be made: a historical perspective and a modern perspective. From a historical perspective, the Ukrainian vowels can be divided into 2 categories:<br/>-#Hard Vowels (''a, y (from Common Slavic *y), o,'' and ''u'' / ''а, и (from Common Slavic *ы), о,'' and ''у'')<br/>-#Soft Vowels (''e, i'' and ''y (from Common Slavic *i)'' / ''е, і'' and ''и (from Common Slavic *и)<br/>-It should be noted that the iotified vowels are considered to be soft vowels.<br/>-From a modern perspective, the Ukrainian vowels can be divided into 2 categories:<br/>-#Hard Vowels (''a, e, y, i, o,'' and ''u'' / ''а, е, и, і, о,'' and ''у''): This category as can be seen from the table is different from the historical hard category.<br/>-#Iotified Vowel (''ja, je, ji,'' and ''ju'' / ''я, є, ї,'' and ''ю'') To this category can also be added the combination of letters ''jo''/''йо.''<br/>-<br/>-===Classification of Consonants===<br/>-In Ukrainian, a four-fold categorisation of consonants can be made:<br/>-*'''Labials''' (''b, v, m, p,'' and ''f'' / ''б, в, м, п,'' and ''ф''): These letters are in Ukrainian almost always hard (there are orthographic exceptions), can never be doubled, nor can they in general be followed by a iotified vowel (exception: in combinations ''CL'' where ''C'' is a dental and ''L'' is a labial, a soft vowel can follow, ''e.g.'' svjato/свято.<br/>-*'''Sibilants''' (''ž, č,'' and ''š'' / ''ж, ч,'' and ''ч'', as well as the digraph ''šč (щ)''): These letters were in Common Slavic all palatal (soft). In Ukrainian, these harded, leading to the creation of the mixed declension of nouns. None of them can be followed by a soft sign ('/ь) or any iotified vowel. All but the digraph can be doubled, in which case they can be followed by a soft vowel e.g. piddashshja/піддашшя.<br/>-*'''Dentals''' (''d, z, l, n, s, t,'' and ''c'' / ''д, з, л, н, с, т'' and ''ц''): In Ukrainian, as in Common Slavic, these letters can be both hard and soft. These letters  can never (unless they are the last letter in a prefix) be followed by an apostrophe. Furthermore, these letters can be doubled.<br/>-*'''Velars''' (''h (g), k,'' and ''x'' / ''г (ґ), к,'' and ''х''): In both Ukrainian and Common Slavic, these letters are always hard. Should they ever be followed by a iotified or soft vowel, then they undergo the first and second palatalisations. Hence, these letters can never be doubled or followed by an apostrophe.<br/>-*'''r/р''': The letter in general behaves similar to the dental category, with the following exception:<br/>-**Word finally ''r'' is always hard.<br/>-**''r'' can never be doubled.<br/>-<br/>-===Historical Phonological Changes===<br/>-In the Ukrainian language, the following sound changes have occurred between the [[Proto-Slavic|Common Slavic]] period and current Ukrainian:<br/>-<br/>-#In a newly closed syllables, that is, a syllable that ends in a consonant, Common Slavic ''o'' and ''e'' mutate into ''i'' if the next vowel in Common Slavic was one of the yers (''ǐ'' (ь) or ''ǔ'' (ъ)).<br/>-#'''[[Pleophony]]''': The Common Slavic combinations, ''ToRT'' and ''TeRT'', where ''T'' is any consonant and ''R'' is either ''r'' or ''l'' become in Ukrainian<br/>-##''TorT'' gives ''ToroT'' (Common Slavic ''*borda'' gives Ukrainian ''boroda'');<br/>-##''TolT'' gives ''ToloT'' (Common Slavic ''*bolto'' gives Ukrainian ''boloto'');<br/>-##''TerT'' gives ''TereT'' (Common Slavic ''*berza'' gives Ukrainian ''bereza''); and<br/>-##''TelT'' gives ''ToloT'' (Common Slavic ''*melko'' gives Ukrainian ''moloko'').<br/>-#In Common Slavic, the nasal vowel, ''ę'', is reflected as ''ja'' except before single labials where it is reflected as ''"ja'' ('я) and sibilants, where it is reflected as ''a.'' Examples: Common Slavic ''*pętĭ'' gives in Ukrainian ''p"jat''' (п'ять); Common Slavic ''*telę'' gives in Ukrainian ''telja''; and Common Slavic ''kyrčę'' gives in Ukrainian ''kyrča.'' Further note that this nasal vowel in Common Slavic is derived from an Indo-European, ''*-en'', ''*-em'', or the sonants ''n'' and ''m''.<br/>-#The Common Slavic letter, ě, is reflected in Ukrainian generally as ''i'' except:<br/>-##initially where it is reflected as ''ji'': Common Slavic ''*ěsti'' gives the Ukrainian ''jisty.''<br/>-##after the sibilants where it is reflected as ''a'': Common Slavic ''*ležěti'' gives the Ukrainian ''ležaty''<br/>-#Common Slavic ''i'' and ''y'' are both reflected in Ukrainian as ''y''<br/>-#The Common Slavic combination ''-CǐjV'', where ''C'' is any consonant and ''V'' is any vowel, becomes in Ukrainian the following combination ''-CCjV'', except<br/>-##if ''C'' is labial or 'r' where it becomes ''-C"jV''<br/>-##if ''V'' is the Common Slavic ''e'', then the vowel in Ukrainian mutates to ''a'' ''e.g.'' Common Slavic ''*žitĭje'' gives the Ukrainian ''žyttja''.<br/>-##if ''V'' is the Common Slavic ''ĭ'', then the combination becomes ''ej'' ''e.g.'' genitive plural in Common Slavic ''*myšĭjĭ'' give in Ukrainian ''myšej''.<br/>-##if there are one or more consonants precede the 'C' then there is no doubling of the consonants in Ukrainian.<br/>-# Common Slavic combinations ''dl'' and ''tl'' are simplified to ''l'', for example, Common Slavic ''*mydlo'' gives Ukrainian ''mylo''.<br/>-# Sonant Common Slavic ''l̥'' and ''ĺ̥'' became ''ov'', while word final ''*lǔ'' became ''v''. For example, Common Slavic ''*vĺ̥kǔ'' becomes ''vovk'' in Ukrainian<br/>-<br/>-===Current Phonological Changes===<br/>-# The First Palatalisation concerns the velars and the following vowels: ''e,'' ''y'' from Common Slavic ''i'', ''a/i'' from Common Slavic ''ě'', that is derived from the Indo-European ''ē'':<br/>-## ''h'' and ''g'' before these vowels mutates into ''ž'';<br/>-## ''k'' before these vowels mutates into ''č''; and<br/>-## ''x'' before these vowels muatates into ''š''.<br/>-# The Second Palatalisation concerns the velars and the following vowels: ''y'' from Common Slavic ''i'' that is derived from an Indo-European diphthong and ''a/i'' from Common Slavic ''ě'' that is derived from an Indo-European diphtong:<br/>-## ''h'' and ''g'' before these vowels mutates into ''z'';<br/>-## ''k'' before these vowels mutates into ''c''; and<br/>-## ''x'' before these vowels muatates into ''s''.<br/>-# The Iotification concerns all consonants and the semi-vowel ''j''/''й''. The following changes occur:<br/>-## The labials insert an ''l'' between the labial and the semi-vowel: Common Slavic ''*zemja'' give Ukrainian ''zemlja''.<br/>-## The velars followed by a semi-vowel mutate as in the first palatalisation. The semi-vowel is dropped. This change can be traced back to Common Slavic.<br/>-## ''ktj'' becomes ''č''<br/>-## ''tj'' becomes ''č''<br/>-## ''dj'' becomes ''ž'', except in verbs where it becomes ''dž''<br/>-## ''cj'' becomes ''š''<br/>-## ''ctj'' and ''ckj'' become ''šč'' (''щ'')<br/>-## ''zdj'' and ''zhj'' become ''ždž''<br/>-## ''zkj'' becomes ''žč''<br/>-## ''lj, nj, pj'' becomes ''l''', ''n''', ''p''' (that is, ''ль, нь, рь'')<br/>-# In Ukrainian, when two or more consonants occur word finally, then a float vowel is inserted under the following conditions <ref>Carlton, T.R. ''A Guide to the Declension of Nouns in Ukrainian''. Edmonton, Alberta: University of Alberta Press, 1972</ref>. Given a consonantal grouping ''C<sub>1</sub>(ь)C<sub>2</sub>(ь)'', where ''C'' is any Ukrainian consonant. The fill vowel is inserted between the two consonants and after the ''ь''. A fill vowel is only inserted if ''C<sub>2</sub>'' is one of the following consonants: ''к, в, л, м, р,'' and ''ц''. In this case:<br/>-## If ''C<sub>1</sub>'' is one of the following ''г, к,'' or ''х'', then the fill vowel is always ''о''.<br/>-## If ''C<sub>2</sub>'' is ''к'' or ''в'', then the fill vowel is ''о''. Note: no fill vowel is inserted if the ''в'' is derived from a sonant ''l'', for example, ''вовк''.<br/>-## If ''C<sub>2</sub>'' is ''л, м, р,'' or ''ц'', then the fill vowel is ''е''.<br/>-## The only known exception is ''відьм'', which should take a fill vowel, but does not.<br/>-## The combinations, ''-ств'' and ''-ськ'' are not broken up.<br/>-## If the ''C<sub>1</sub>'' is ''й'', then the above rules can apply. However, both forms (with and without the fill vowel) often exist.<br/>-<br/>-==Morphology==<br/>-===Nominal===<br/>-====Nouns====<br/>-Nominal [[declension]] is subject to seven [[declension|cases]] ([[nominative]], [[genitive]], [[dative]], [[Accusative case|accusative]], [[instrumental case|instrumental]], [[locative case|locative]], and [[vocative]]), in two numbers ([[singular]] and [[plural]]), and obeying absolutely grammatical [[gender]] ([[masculine]], [[feminine]], and [[neuter]]). The adjectives, pronouns, and the first two cardinal numbers further  vary by gender.  [[Old Ruthenian]] also had a third number, the [[Dual grammatical number|dual]], but except for its use in the nominative and accusative cases with the numbers two, three and four, eg. ('''dvi hryvni''' / '''дві гривні''', recategorized today as a genitive singular), it has been lost. Other traces of the dual can be found when referring to objects of which there are commonly two: eyes, shoulders, ears, ''e.g.'' ''plečyma''. Occassionally, dual forms can distinguish between meanings.<br/>-<br/>-In Ukrainian, there are 4 declension types.  The first declension is used for most feminine nouns.  The second declension is used for most masculine and neuter nouns.  The third declension is used for feminine nouns ending in '''ь''' or a sibilant. The fourth declension is used for neuter nouns ending in '''я/а''' (Common Slavic ''*ę'').<br/>-Most of the types consist of 3 different subgroups: hard, mixed, and soft. The soft subgroup consists of nouns whose roots end in a soft letter (followed by iotified vowel or soft vowel). The mixed subgroup consists of the nouns whose roots end in a sibilant or occassionally ''r''. The hard group consists of all other nouns.<br/>-<br/>-If the hard group endings are taken as the basis, then the following rules can be used to derived the corresponding mixed and soft endings:<br/>-*Mixed subgroup<br/>-*# All ''o'' following a sibilant change to ''e''.<br/>-*# All ''y'' following a sibilant change to ''i''.<br/>-*Soft subgroup: Whenever a soft sign or the semi-vowel encounters the vowel of the ending, the following changes occur (These are mainly orthographic changes):<br/>-*# ''ьа'' and ''йа'' gives ''я''<br/>-*# ''ьо'' gives ''е''<br/>-*# ''йо'' gives ''є''<br/>-*# ''ьи'' gives ''і''<br/>-*# ''йи'' gives ''ї''<br/>-*# ''ьу'' and ''йу'' gives ''ю''<br/>-*# ''ьі''  gives ''і''<br/>-*# ''йі'' gives ''ї''<br/>-<br/>-Nouns ending in a consonant are marked in the following tables with -0- (thus no ending).<br/>-<br/>-=====First Declension=====<br/>-<br/>-This declension consists of nouns which end in ''а'' or ''я''. It consists primarily of feminine nouns, but a few nouns with these ending referring to professions can be either masculine or feminine. In these cases, the genitive plural is often formed by adding ''-ів''. Nouns referring to people can also take this ending.<br/>-<br/>-{| class="wikitable" align=center<br/>-|+ '''First Declension: Feminine Nouns'''<br/>-| || colspan="4" align="center"|'''Singular'''<br/>-|-<br/>-! <br/>-!

The other forms are all acceptable. Form which take the ''-і'' ending undergo the first palatalisation.<br/>-*(6) If the ending ''-е'' is used, then the first palatalisation occurs. However, it can be avoided by using the ''-о'' form.<br/>-*(7) The second ending occurs is a small group of nouns.<br/>-*(8) The genitive form is used with animate objects, while inanimate objects take the nominative forms.<br/>-<br/>-'''Neuter Nouns'''<br/>-In this category belong neuter nouns ending in ''о'', ''е'', and those substantives ending in ''я'', preceded by either a double consonant, apostrophe, or two consonants, which primarily are derived from verbs.

Common examples of this anomoulous declension are ''бабин'' (masculine) compared to ''бабина'' (feminine); ''братів'' (masculine) compared to ''братова'' (feminine); and ''повинен'' (masculine) compared to ''повинна''.

In the nominative case, the nouns agrees with the last number in any compound number. Nouns which must agree with a number ending in 2, 3, or 4 are in the genitive singular or nominative plural (the forms are the same), but retain the stress of the dual. Nouns, which must agree with a number ending in 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, and all the teens are in the genitive plural. In any other case, the nouns and numbers are in the same case.<br/>-<br/>-===Verbs===<br/>-[[Grammatical conjugation]] is subject to three [[Grammatical person|persons]] in two numbers and three simple [[Grammatical tense|tenses]] (present/future, future, and past), with [[periphrasis|periphrastic]] forms for the future and [[Conditional mood|Conditional]], as well as [[imperative]] forms and present/past [[participle]]s, distinguished by [[adjective|adjectival]] and [[adverb|adverbial]] usage.  There are two [[grammatical voice|voices]], [[active voice|active]] and [[middle voice|middle]]/[[passive voice|passive]], which is constructed by the addition of a reflexive [[suffix]] '''-ся/сь''' to the active form.  An interesting feature is that the past tense is actually made to agree in gender with the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]], for it is the [[participle]] in an originally periphrastic [[perfect tense]] formed with the present of '''быть''' {{IPA|/bɨtʲ/}},"to be." Verbal inflection today is considerably simpler than in Common Slavic. The ancient [[Aorist tense|aorist]], [[imperfect tense|imperfect]], and (periphrastic) [[pluperfect]] tenses have been lost. The loss of three of the former six tenses has been offset by the reliance, as in other Slavic languages, on verbal [[grammatical aspect|aspect]].  Most verbs come in pairs, one with [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]] or continuous connotation, the other with [[perfective aspect|perfective]] or completed, usually formed with a (prepositional) prefix, but occasionally using a different root.<br/>-<br/>-The present tense of the verb '''бути''', "[[Copula|to be]]", today normally has the form, ''є'' used for all persons and numbers. Previously and occassionally in liturgical settings, aspects of the full conjugation, can be found.

The active voice is the only voice with a complete set of conjugations. The active voice, in general, shows a direct effect of the verb on its subject.<br/>-<br/>-====Indicative Active Mood====<br/>-The [[indicative mood]] is used to describe events, which have, are, or will occur. In Ukrainian, the indicative mood contains a present, future, and past tenses.<br/>-<br/>-=====Present tense=====<br/>-Historically, this is derived from the Indo-European present tense. In Common Slavic and later Ukrainian, it retained its present meaning only for imperfective verbs and developed a future meaning for perfective verbs.<br/>-<br/>-For the ''е'' stems (Classes 1, 2, and 3), the endings are:<br/>-<br/>-{| class="wikitable"<br/>-|+ '''е stem endings'''<br/>-! <br/>-! singular<br/>-! plural<br/>-|-<br/>-| '''First Person''' || -у / -ю || -емо / -ємо <br/>-|-<br/>-| '''Second Person''' || -еш / -єш ||-ете / -єте <br/>-|-<br/>-| '''Third Person''' || -е / -є || -уть / -ють<br/>-|}<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-All verbs whose roots end in a velar undergo the first palatalisation in all forms of the present (even though historically speaking the first person singular should not). The endings in ''є'' are used for roots whose stem ends in a vowel. All verbs in Class 3 and those which end in a vowel use ''-ю'' and ''-ють''. Furthermore, Class 3 verbs undergo iotification in those forms which use ''-ю-''. For reflexive verbs, in the third person singular, the ending has its historical ''-ть'' restored before the participle ''-ся / -сь'' is affixed. Thus, the ending becomes ''-еться''.<br/>-<br/>-For the ''и'' stems (Class 4), the endings are: <br/>-<br/>-<br/>-{| class="wikitable"<br/>-|+ '''и stem endings'''<br/>-! <br/>-! singular<br/>-! plural<br/>-|-<br/>-| '''First Person''' ||  -ю / (-у) || -имо / -їмо <br/>-|-<br/>-| '''Second Person''' || -иш / -їш ||-ите / -їте <br/>-|-<br/>-| '''Third Person''' || -ить / -їть || -ать / -ять<br/>-|}<br/>-<br/>-All Class 4 verbs undergo iotofication in the first person singular. Thus, there is really only one ending, which due to orthographic reasons is given 2 different forms. Verbs ending in a vowel take the endings in the second column. In the thirsd person plural, verbs ending in a labial insert an ''л'' before the ending, ''-ять''. The ending ''-ать'' is used after the sibilants ''ж, ш, щ'', or ''ч''.<br/>-<br/>-======Examples======<br/>-{| class="wikitable"<br/>-|+ '''нести (stem: нес-) (Class 1 verb)'''<br/>-'''<br/>-! <br/>-! colspan="2" |singular<br/>-! colspan="2" |plural<br/>-|-<br/>-| || Ukrainian || English || Ukrainian || English<br/>-|-<br/>-| '''First Person''' ||  несу || I am carrying || несемо || We are carrying <br/>-|-<br/>-| '''Second Person''' || несеш || You (sing.) are carrying || несете || You (pl.)  are carrying <br/>-|-<br/>-| '''Third Person''' || несе || He/She/It is carrying || несуть || They are carrying<br/>-|}<br/>-<br/>-{| class="wikitable"<br/>-|+ '''вернути (stem: верн-) (Class 2 verb)'''<br/>-'''<br/>-! <br/>-! colspan="2" |singular<br/>-! colspan="2" |plural<br/>-|-<br/>-| || Ukrainian || English || Ukrainian || English<br/>-|-<br/>-| '''First Person''' ||  верну || I will return || вернемо || We will return <br/>-|-<br/>-| '''Second Person''' || вернеш || You (sing.) will return || вернете || You (pl.) will return <br/>-|-<br/>-| '''Third Person''' || верне || He/She/It will return || вернуть || They will return<br/>-|}<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-{| class="wikitable"<br/>-|+ '''читати (stem: чита-) (Class 3 verb)''' <br/>-! <br/>-! colspan="2" |singular<br/>-! colspan="2" |plural<br/>-|-<br/>-| || Ukrainian || English || Ukrainian || English<br/>-|-<br/>-| '''First Person''' ||  читаю || I read || читаємо || We read<br/>-|-<br/>-| '''Second Person''' || читаєш || You (sing.) read || читаєте || You (pl.) read<br/>-|-<br/>-| '''Third Person''' || читає || He/She/It reads || читають || They read<br/>-|}<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-{| class="wikitable"<br/>-|+ '''говорити - (stem: говор-) (Class 4 verb)'''<br/>-! <br/>-! colspan="2" |singular<br/>-! colspan="2" |plural<br/>-|-<br/>-| || Ukrainian || English || Ukrainian || English<br/>-|-<br/>-| '''First Person''' ||  говорю || I talk || говоримо || We talk<br/>-|-<br/>-| '''Second Person''' || говориш || You (sing.) talk || говорите || You (pl.) talk<br/>-|-<br/>-| '''Third Person''' || говорить || He/She/It talks || говорять || They talk<br/>-|}<br/>-<br/>-======[[Athematic verb]]s======<br/>-Ukrainian inherited from Indo-European through Common Slavic, the following 3 athematic verbs. These verbs have their own conjugation in the present. Everywhere else they are regular.<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-{| class="wikitable"<br/>-|+ '''дати - to give (perfective)'''<br/>-! <br/>-! singular<br/>-! plural<br/>-|-<br/>-| '''First Person''' || дам || дамо <br/>-|-<br/>-| '''Second Person''' || даси ||дасте <br/>-|-<br/>-| '''Third Person''' || дасть || дадуть<br/>-|}<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-{| class="wikitable"<br/>-|+ '''їсти - to eat (imperfective)'''<br/>-! <br/>-! singular<br/>-! plural<br/>-|-<br/>-| '''First Person''' || їм || їмо <br/>-|-<br/>-| '''Second Person''' || їси ||їсте <br/>-|-<br/>-| '''Third Person''' || їсть || їдять<br/>-|}<br/>-<br/>-{| class="wikitable"<br/>-|+ '''Compounds ending in -вісти'''<br/>-! <br/>-! singular<br/>-! plural<br/>-|-<br/>-| '''First Person''' || -вім || -вімо <br/>-|-<br/>-| '''Second Person''' || -віси ||-вісте <br/>-|-<br/>-| '''Third Person''' || -вість || -відять<br/>-|}<br/>-<br/>-=====Past Active Tense=====<br/>-The past tense in Ukrainian has the pecularity of being originally an adjective, since it derives from the original compound perfect tense. Thus, the past tense agrees in number and gender with the subject of the verb. The following endings are added to the infinitive with the ending ''-ти'' removed (Most root final ''д'' and ''т'' are dropped):<br/>-<br/>-*masculine singular: ''-в''<br/>-**Note: It is lost after ''с, з, к, г, б, р''.<br/>-*feminine singular: ''-ла''<br/>-*neuter singular: ''-ло''<br/>-*plural: ''-ли''<br/>-<br/>-These forms are often called the active past participle I.<br/>-<br/>-=====Future Active Tense=====<br/>-In Ukrainian, there are 2 different future tenses for imperfective verbs. The first form formed by adding to the infinitive of the verb the following endings, which are derived from the Common Slavic verb ''*jĭmati'' (Ukrainian мати):<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-{| class="wikitable"<br/>-|+ ''' Futre Tense: First Form'''<br/>-! <br/>-! colspan="2" |singular<br/>-! colspan="2" |plural<br/>-|-<br/>-| || Ending || Example || Ending || Example<br/>-|-<br/>-| '''First Person''' ||  -му ||їстиму|| -мо || їстимо<br/>-|-<br/>-| '''Second Person''' || -меш || їстимеш ||-мете || їстимете <br/>-|-<br/>-| '''Third Person''' || -ме || їстиме ||  -муть || їстимуть<br/>-|}<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-The second form, commonly used in speach, is to take the present tense conjugation of the verb ''бути'' and use it with the infinitive of the verb. Thus,<br/>-<br/>-{| class="wikitable"<br/>-|+ '''Future Tense: Second Form'''<br/>-! <br/>-! singular<br/>-! plural<br/>-|-<br/>-| '''First Person''' ||  буду їсти|| будемо їсти<br/>-|-<br/>-| '''Second Person''' || будеш їсти || будете їсти <br/>-|-<br/>-| '''Third Person''' || буде їсти || будуть їсти<br/>-|}<br/>-<br/>-This will translate as ''will eat'' with the appropriate personal pronoun.<br/>-<br/>-====Imperative Active Mood====<br/>-The [[grammatical mood#imperative mood|imperative mood]] is used to give commands. It exists in only the present tense in Ukrainian. There are no forms for the 1<sup>st</sup> person singular. <br/>-In Ukrainian, the imperative mood is formed from the stem of the verb plus the following endings (The example is based on Ukrainian ''пити''):<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-{| class="wikitable" <br/>-|+ '''Imperative Mood in Ukrainian'''<br/>-! <br/>-! singular<br/>-! plural<br/>-|-<br/>-| '''First Person''' || ''none'' || -ьмо / -ймо / -мо / -імо (пиймо)<br/>-|-<br/>-| '''Second Person''' || -ь / -й / -0- / -и (пий) ||-ьте / -йте / -те / -іть (пийте) <br/>-|-<br/>-| '''Third Person''' || нехай + 3<sup>rd</sup> person present singular (нехай п'є)  ||нехай + 3<sup>rd</sup> person present plural (нехай п'ють)<br/>-|}<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-The first set of endings is to be used for stems that end in a dentals (''з, д, т, с, н,'' and ''л''). The second set of ending is used for stems that end in a vowel. The third set of endings is used for stems that end in labials or sibilants (''б, в, м, п, ф, ш, щ, ч, ж,'' and ''р''). The fourth set of endings is used with verbs whose unaffixed form (no prefixes or suffixes) has the stress on the ending in the first person singular of the present tense. Thus for example, ''бери'' and ''вибери''.<br/>-<br/>-Finally note that all verbs with stems that end in ''к'' and ''г'' undergo the first palatalisation. Class 3 verbs with stems in ''к'', ''г'', and ''с'' undergo iotification (as do their present conjugation).<br/>-<br/>-====Conditional Active Mood====<br/>-The [[grammatical mood#conditional mood|conditional mood]] is used to state hypothetical states, wishes, and desires. It has 2 tenses in Ukrainian: a present and a past.<br/>-<br/>-=====Present Tense=====<br/>-The present conditional is formed in Ukrainian from the particple ''би'', which is derived from the archaic aorist conjugation of the verb, ''бути'', and the active past participle I, which is the same as the past indicative participle. Thus, there is agreement between the subject and the participle. An example of this construction would be ''я би хотів...'' (I would like...).<br/>-<br/>-=====Past Tense=====<br/>-The past conditional is formed in Ukrainian from the particple ''би'' followed by the active past participle I form of the verb ''бути'' (''був, була, було, були'') and then the active past participle I of the verb. Both participles must agree with the subject. An example of this construction would be ''як я би був знав...'' (had I  (had) known...). <br/>-<br/>-====Passive Voice====<br/>-The [[passive voice]] has 2 different functions. It can either show that the subject had something done to itself or that something indeteminate occurred to the subject.<br/>-In Ukrainian, the passive voice is formed as follows:<br/>-# Use of a reflexive verb: ''митися'' (to wash oneself or in French ''se laver'')<br/>-#Use of the verb ''to be'' and the past passive participle: ''Він був забитий'' (He was killed).<br/>-# An impersonal use of the third person plural past active participle I: ''Його забили'' (He was killed).<br/>-# The following construction: ''Було'' + neuter singular of past passive participle: ''Місто було добуте'' (The town was capture.).<br/>-<br/>-====Participles and Verbal Nouns====<br/>-<br/>-In Ukrainian, there exist traces of all 5 Common Slavic particples.<br/>-<br/>-=====Present Active Participle=====<br/>-<br/>-This participle is formed by taking the third person plural form, dropping the ''ть'', and adding ''чи(й)''. Most commonly this participle is used as gerund with the form ''чи'' with a meaning approaching the equivalent English construction with ''-ing''. Occassionally, it is used as an adjective. It this case its form is ''чий''. Examples of this particple are ''несучи'', ''знаючи'', and ''хвалячи''.<br/>-<br/>-=====Present Passive Participle=====<br/>-<br/>-This participle does not exist in Ukrainian as a separate form. However, it is commonly encountered as an adjective in ''-мий''. Common examples of this participle are ''відомий'' and ''знайомий''.<br/>-<br/>-=====Past Active Participle I=====<br/>-<br/>-This participle is encountered in forming the past tense in Ukrainian. Occassionally, it is found as an adjective for intransitive verbs. It is formed by taking the infinitive stem and adding the ending ''-в, -ла, -ло,'' and ''-ли'' to form the past tense participle (in reality the indefinite form of the adjective) and the ending ''-лий'' to form the regular adjective. An example of the adjectival form is ''почорнілий''.<br/>-<br/>-=====Past Active Participle II=====<br/>-<br/>-This participle is most commonly encondered as a gerund, while it is only used occassionally as an adjective. It is formed by taking the masculine past participle I and adding the ending ''-ши(й)''. An example of the gerund is ''знавши'', while an extremely common adjective would the word ''бувший''.<br/>-<br/>-=====Past Passive Participle=====<br/>-<br/>-This participle is the only participle that is is commonly used as an adjective. It has 2 different methods of formation. Take the infinitive stem, add ''а/е'', and then either add ''-тий'' or ''-ний''. Class 4 verbs undergo iotification. There does not seem to be any difference between the 2 methods of forming the participles. This participle can roughly be translated using the English past participle. Examples of this participle are ''жатий'', ''посланий'', ''печений'', and ''лишений''.<br/>-<br/>-=====Verbal Noun=====<br/>-<br/>-The verbal noun is created by taking the past passive participle, dropping ''ий'', doubling the consonant if permitted by the rules under ''-ĭjV'', and adding a ''я''. This will be a neuter noun declined like all neuter nouns in ''*ĭjе''. It should be noted that if the ''-е-'' of the past passive participle is stressed then the ''е'' will mutate into an ''і''. Examples include ''питання'' from ''питати'' and ''носіння'' from ''носити''.<br/>-<br/>-The verbal noun in Ukrainian is derived from the Common Slavic verbal noun, where it was formed by adding ''*-ĭjе'' to the past passive participle without the ''*ŭ'' ending. Thus, in Ukrainian, the consonant is doubled if possible.<br/>- <br/>-===Word formation===<br/>-Ukrainian has on hand a set of [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefixes]], [[preposition|prepositional]] and [[adverb|adverbial]] in nature, as well as [[diminutive]], [[augmentative]], and [[frequentative]] [[suffix|suffixes]] and [[infix|infixes]]. All of these can be stacked one upon the other, to produce multiple derivatives of a given word.  Participles and other inflexional forms may also have a special [[connotation]].  <br/>-<br/>-===Fundamental sentence structure===<br/>-====Coordination====<br/>-The common Ukrainain [[coordination]]s are:<br/>-* і (and)<br/>-* та (and)<br/>-* али (but)<br/>-<br/>-====Subordination====<br/>-Common Ukrainian subordinations are:<br/>-<br/>-* як (how, if)<br/>-* коли (when)<br/>-<br/>-==Syntax==<br/>-The basic word order, both in conversation and the written language, is '''[[Subject Verb Object]]'''.  However, because the relations are marked by inflexion, considerable latitude in word order is allowed, and all the permutations can be used.  The word order expresses the logical stress, and the degree of definiteness. <br/>-<br/>-=== Negation ===<br/>-Unlike English, Latin, and various other languages, Ukrainian allows multiple negatives, as in '''ніхто ніколи нікому нічого не прощає''' "No-one ever forgives anything to anyone" (literally, "no-one never to no-one nothing not forgives").<br/>-<br/>-===Inflectional usage===<br/>-====Case====<br/>-The use of cases in Ukrainian can be very complicated. In general, the nominative, genitive, accusative, and vocative cases can be used without a preposition. On the other hand, the locative and instrumental cases are used primarily with preposition. Furthermore and much like in [[Latin]], different prepositions can be followed by nouns in different cases, which results in different meanings.<br/>-<br/>-====Tense and aspect====<br/>-Ukrainian has two "aspects" of its verb form, depending on how the action is performed. These are called the '''imperfective''' and '''perfective''' forms. The imperfective form denotes action is taking place in the present, is ongoing, is repetitive, or is habitual. The perfective form indicates completion, the result of an action, beginning of an action, or actions that are shorter or longer than usual. E.g., '''спати''' is imperfective; '''поспати''' is perfective.<br/>-<br/>-==See also==<br/>-* [[Ukrainian language]]<br/>-==Translation of Words==<br/>-Note: All Common Slavic words quoted are translated faithfully by their Ukrainian forms.<br/>-Abreviations used: <br/>-* m: masculine noun<br/>-* f: feminine noun<br/>-* nt: neuter noun<br/>-* n: noun declined like an adjective, with different forms for each gender<br/>-* v: verb<br/>-* adj: adjective<br/>-* adv: adverb<br/>-* ger: gerund<br/>-* pr: pronoun<br/>-* co: cojunction<br/>-<br/>-{{col-begin}}<br/>-{{col-break|width=50%}}<br/>-* бабин (babyn): (adj) belonging to a grandmother (masculine nominative form)<br/>-* бабина (babyna): (adj) belonging to a grandmother (feminine nominative form) <br/>-* береза (bereza): (f) birch<br/>-* бити (byty): (v) to hit<br/>-* болото (boloto): (nt) mud, swamp<br/>-* борода (boroda): (f) beard<br/>-* брати (braty): (nt) to take<br/>-* братів (brativ): (adj) belonging to a brother (masculine nominative form)<br/>-* братова (bratova): (adj) belong to a brother (feminien nominative form)<br/>-* бувший (buvšyj): (adj) former, ex- (that which once was)<br/>-* бути (buty): (v) to be<br/>-* ваш (vaš): (adj) yours (pl)<br/>-* вернути (vernuty): (v) to return something<br/>-* вертіти (vertity): (v) to turn about repeatedly<br/>-* вибрати (vybraty): (v) to choose, elect<br/>-* відомий (vidomyj): (adj) well-known<br/>-* відьм (vid'm): (f) witches (genitive plural)<br/>-* вовк (vovk): (m) wolf<br/>-* гарний (harnyj): (adj) nice<br/>-* гарно (harno): (adv) nicely<br/>-* говорити (hovoryty): (v) to speak<br/>-* гривня ([[hryvnia]]): (f) Ukrainian currency<br/>-* двигнути (dvyhnyty): (v) to exert<br/>-* думати (dumaty): (v) to think<br/>-* жатий (žatyj): (adj) harvested<br/>-* жовтіти (žovtity): (v) to turn yellow<br/>-* земля (zemlja): (f) earth<br/>-* знати (znaty): (v) to know<br/>-* знайомий (znajomyj): (adj) friendly (known); (n) friend<br/>-* знавши (znavšy): (ger) having known<br/>-* знаючи (znajučy): (ger) knowing <br/>-* ім'я (im"ja): (nt) name<br/>-* їсти (jisty): (v) to eat<br/>-* їхний (jixnyj): (adj) theirs<br/>-* купувати (kupuvaty): (v) to buy<br/>-* курча (kurča): (nt) baby chicken<br/>-* лежати (ležaty): (v) to lie in some given place<br/>-* лити (lyty): (v) to pour<br/>-* лишений (lyšenyj): (adj) left<br/>-* мати (maty): (v) to have<br/>-* мило (mylo): (nt) soap<br/>-<br/>-{{col-break|width=50%}}<br/>-<br/>-* мій (mij): (adj) mine<br/>-* молоко (moloko): (nt) milk<br/>-* молоти (moloty): (v) to grind<br/>-* наш (naš): (adj) ours<br/>-* ніч (nič): (f) night<br/>-* нести (necty): (v) to carry<br/>-* несучи(й) (nesučy(j)): (ger) carrying; (adj) that which is being carried <br/>-* носити (nosyty): (v) to carry<br/>-* носіння (nosinnja): (nt) act of carrying <br/>-* орати (oraty): (v) to plow<br/>-* пекти (nekty): (v) to bake<br/>-* печений (pečehyj): (adj) baked<br/>-* питати (pytaty): (v) to ask<br/>-* питання (pytannja): (nt) question<br/>-* пити (pyty): (v) to drink<br/>-* плечима (plečyma): (nt) shoulders (instrumental plural form)<br/>-* плисти (plysty): (v) to float<br/>-* повинен (povynen): (adj) required to be done (often translated using the verb, should) (masculine nominative form)<br/>-* повинна (povynna): (adj) required to be done (feminine nominative form)<br/>-* полоти (poloty): (v) to weed<br/>-* посланий (poclanyj): (adj) sent<br/>-* попросити (poprosyty): (v) to ask for something<br/>-* поспати (pospaty): (v) to nap<br/>-* почати (počaty): (v) to start<br/>-* почорнілий (počorhilyj): (adj) having been blackened<br/>-* рвати (rvaty): (v) to rip<br/>-* свято (svjato): (nt) holiday<br/>-* сіяти (sijaty): (v) to plant / seed<br/>-* спати (spaty): (v) to sleep<br/>-* твій (tvij): (adj) yours (sing.)<br/>-* теля (telja): (nt) baby lamb<br/>-* умерти (umerty): (v) to die (animate)<br/>-* хвалити (xvalyty): (v) to praise<br/>-* хвалячи (xvaljačy): (ger) praising<br/>-* хотіти (xotity): (v) to want, desire<br/>-* хто (xto): (pr) who<br/>-* чий (čyj): (adj) whose<br/>-* читати (čytaty): (v) to read<br/>-* що (ščo): (pr) what<br/>-* як (jak): (co) if<br/>-{{col-end}}<br/>-<br/>-==Footnotes==<br/>-<div class="references-small" style="-moz-column-count:2; column-count:2;"><br/>-<references /><br/>-</div><br/>-==References==<br/>-* ''Український Правопис'' 4th editon Kiev, 1993.<br/>-* De Bray, R.

I try to do the same thing myself, and although I have been especially working on Hinduism-related articles, I have noticed your good work on articles like Islam. Much of what I do on wikipedia is trying to promote NPOV in all articles. So I'm quite open to criticism.  I trust that you too, since you seem reasonable and committed to quality, are open to suggestions. Here are two I would make, and I hope you take them in the spirit of helpfulness I mean them to have.<br/>+#Try to keep a friendly tone. People will typically have a better reaction to your edits if you say "Perhaps we should change x to y in order to make it clearer and NPOV," rather than "Whoever made this edit ought to be dragged out into the street and shot without a chance to say their prayers!" (Of course I'm exaggerating, and you didn't say anything quite so extreme).<br/>+#Be careful not to "throw the baby out with the bathwater."  Remember that it is always easier to delete than to draft new material. In general, I think it is better not to delete material unless I have something better to replace it with. In some cases, it may be better to replace it with nothing. But in many cases if you just delete a lot of material, the section of the article will cease to be coherent. So consider not only the sentences themselves, but also how they interact with the rest of the article. Ask yourself, "if I delete this section, will it leave important questions unanswered in the mind of the reader?"<br/>+<br/>+Well, these are just my thoughts. Thanks for all your hard work on all the articles you've improved! Happy editing ! By the way, although I am a Hindu, I will defend you if anybody challenges your right to contribute simply becasue you are not Hindu. Some have suggested that non-Hindu editors be screened out. Such a view is wrong. There is no requirement that you belong to a certain religion in order to edit any article.

I am not sure what is going on between you and TruthSpreader, but I suggest you to not remove Hadith material. It is an important resource in Islam. I am not sure what is your background?

What I will try to do is collect some stories as recorded from historical books. I understand that WikiPedia is to document and collect what is written by others. This Hadith mentioned here is really used and argued not by TruthSpreader, but is used by many authors to explain the story. I think this should be made more accurate as you suggested. It should not be implied that any of us is concluding this, but it is what the Scholars generally concluded. This article is quite poor when compared to a good documentation of the story that usually requires several book pages. Anyway, I understand tottaly what you say here. I will work on this story as it need more attention. Finally, I am not sure about that Hadith you sent me, I do not see why it should or should not be included. If it is a true Hadith, I mean its degree is strong and authentic, then it should be discussed in whatever article. I do not see why not.

There are various aspects of this. All Hadiths have been assigned a degree of truth based on their narrator sequence and other issues. Unless the Hadith is weak or rejected, because some are, it should be used. It is well known that there are many occasions when a Hadith has been falsely connected to Muhammad. Anyway, I think that is an issue you can resolve at other article. If you need my help, please let me know if I can offer anything. I do have a quite good database to verify any Hadith mostly. There are also a bunch of them on the Web. In any case, please let me know. But again, I basicly do not see any reason to exclude a Hadith particularly if it is ranked Sahih by experts. If you want, I may look up the Gekos one for you. If it is ranked high, then it should be there in the article.

Poor throughout his youth, he was handsomely rewarded for his diligence as a prospector with the discovery of the famous Humbug mine in the [[Tintic Mining District]] near [[Eureka, Utah|Eureka]], [[Utah]] in [[1886]]. As the Humbug proved profitable, he acquired other mines in the vicinity, including the Uncle Sam, Beck Tunnel, Iron Blossom, and Colorado.  After making his fortune, Knight went on to found the LDS settlement of [[Raymond, Alberta]], [[Canada]].<br/> <br/>-*Nouns have grammatical gender, number, and are declined for 7 cases;<br/>-*Adjectives agree with the noun in case, number, and gender;<br/>-*Verbs have 2 aspects, 3 tenses, 3 moods, and 2 voices.<br/>+Knight is significant in western mining and entrepreneurial history because in several important ways he differed from the typical "[[robber baron (industrialist)|robber baron]]" capitalists of the late-nineteenth century [[Gilded Age]]. His success, like theirs, depended upon the skillful acquisition and management of such business variables as claims, labor, capital, technology, and government services, and also upon the development of cost-efficient integrated enterprises, such as the Knight Investment Company. However, he also owned more patented mining claims in the [[Intermountain West]] than did his counterparts, and he was not inclined to engage in stock manipulation like many other mining entrepreneurs and railroad barons. Moreover, his business methods, especially when dealing with his working men, were far more paternalistic and benevolent than those of the typical big businessmen of the era. While other company town and mine owners often exploited their workers, Knight treated his workers very fairly in his company town of [[Knightville, Utah]], which he equipped with a meetinghouse, amusement hall, and school instead of the usual hedonistic establishments of mining camp life. <br/> <br/>-Furthermore, many verbs show traces of Indo-European gradation ([[ablaut]]). This often explains the difference between the infinitive and its present root form of the verbs.<br/>+Although Knight's [[philanthropy]] was not unique for the period, his generous gifts to [[Brigham Young University]] (an interest he shared with his wife, Amanda) earned him the reputation as the "patron saint" of BYU. He also gave freely to the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] and to many church-related projects, thereby revealing a kindly, religiously motivated disposition. Furthermore, his comfortable but unostentatious home in [[Provo, Utah]], did not rival the extravagantly garish mansions built by big businessmen from [[San Francisco]]'s [[Nob Hill]] to [[New York City|New York]]'s [[Fifth Avenue (Manhattan)|Fifth Avenue]]. Nor did he seek high political office like mining kings [[George Hearst]], [[James Graham Fair|James Fair]], [[William Sharon]], [[John P. Jones]], [[Nathaniel P. Hill|Nathaniel Hill]], [[Jerome B. Chaffee]], [[Horace Tabor]], [[William Andrews Clark|William Clark]], or Utah's [[Thomas Kearns]]—all of whom served in the "millionaire's club" of the [[United States Senate]].  <br/> <br/>-The spoken language has been influenced by the literary, but continues to preserve characteristic forms.  The dialects show various non-standard grammatical features, some of which are archaisms or descendants of old forms since discarded by the literary language.<br/>+Essentially more sensitive and modest than most business leaders during this age of ruthless capitalism and conspicuous consumption, he probably deserved the endearing nickname of "Uncle Jesse"—a rich but giving uncle. In fact, he believed that his money was for the purpose of doing good and building up his church; he regarded the matter as a "trusted stewardship." As he once said, "The earth is the Lord's bank, and no man has a right to take money out of that bank and use it extravagantly upon himself." Few nabobs of the era would have been willing to make that statement. Although he strayed from the LDS Church in his early years and briefly affiliated with the anti-Mormon [[Liberal Party (Utah)|Liberal Party]] in Utah, one must assume that his otherwise devout faith helped prevent him from falling prey to the capitalistic corruption and self-indulgent excesses so tempting and common to the business leaders of the Gilded Age and the western mining industry.<br/> <br/>-'''Note 1''':  For an introductory overview, please see the discussion in the [[Ukrainian language#Grammar|Ukrainian language]] article.<br/>+After making his fortune in mining, Knight went on to develop settlement and industry in what is today southern [[Alberta]].  In [[1901]], Knight purchased 30,000 acres of land in Canada's [[Northwest Territories]] for $2.50 per acre.  On this property he established a ranch; Knight later went on to acquire another 226,000 acres of land near his ranch and established a town built around [[irrigation|irrigation farming]] of [[sugar beets]], which were then processed in a local [[sugar]] factory that Knight built. The settlement was named ''Raymond'' in honor of his son, [[Raymond Knight]].  Within five years, over 1,500 Latter-day Saints—mostly from Utah—had immigrated to Raymond.  The town incorporated in [[1903]], and today Knight is honored as the founder of [[Raymond, Alberta]].<br/> <br/>-'''Note 2''': In the discussion below, various terms are used in the meaning they have in the standard Ukrainian discussions of historical grammar.  In particular, [[aorist]], [[imperfect tense|imperfect]], etc. are considered verbal [[tense]]s rather than [[grammatical aspect|aspects]], because ancient examples of them are attested for both perfective and imperfective verbs.<br/>+'''Sources'''<br/> <br/>-'''Note 3''': [[Cyrillic]] letters in this article are [[romanized]] using [[scientific transliteration]]<br/>+Peterson, Richard H., Utah History Encyclopedia, http://www.media.utah.edu/UHE/k/KNIGHT,JESSE.html<br/> <br/>-==Phonology==<br/>-The following points of Ukrainian phonology need to considered in order to understand the various changes that occur in the declension of nouns.<br/>-===Classification of Vowels===<br/>-Two different classifiction of vowels can be made: a historical perspective and a modern perspective. From a historical perspective, the Ukrainian vowels can be divided into 2 categories:<br/>-#Hard Vowels (''a, y (from Common Slavic *y), o,'' and ''u'' / ''а, и (from Common Slavic *ы), о,'' and ''у'')<br/>-#Soft Vowels (''e, i'' and ''y (from Common Slavic *i)'' / ''е, і'' and ''и (from Common Slavic *и)<br/>-It should be noted that the iotified vowels are considered to be soft vowels.<br/>-From a modern perspective, the Ukrainian vowels can be divided into 2 categories:<br/>-#Hard Vowels (''a, e, y, i, o,'' and ''u'' / ''а, е, и, і, о,'' and ''у''): This category as can be seen from the table is different from the historical hard category.<br/>-#Iotified Vowel (''ja, je, ji,'' and ''ju'' / ''я, є, ї,'' and ''ю'') To this category can also be added the combination of letters ''jo''/''йо.''<br/>-<br/>-===Classification of Consonants===<br/>-In Ukrainian, a four-fold categorisation of consonants can be made:<br/>-*'''Labials''' (''b, v, m, p,'' and ''f'' / ''б, в, м, п,'' and ''ф''): These letters are in Ukrainian almost always hard (there are orthographic exceptions), can never be doubled, nor can they in general be followed by a iotified vowel (exception: in combinations ''CL'' where ''C'' is a dental and ''L'' is a labial, a soft vowel can follow, ''e.g.'' svjato/свято.<br/>-*'''Sibilants''' (''ž, č,'' and ''š'' / ''ж, ч,'' and ''ч'', as well as the digraph ''šč (щ)''): These letters were in Common Slavic all palatal (soft). In Ukrainian, these harded, leading to the creation of the mixed declension of nouns. None of them can be followed by a soft sign ('/ь) or any iotified vowel. All but the digraph can be doubled, in which case they can be followed by a soft vowel e.g. piddashshja/піддашшя.<br/>-*'''Dentals''' (''d, z, l, n, s, t,'' and ''c'' / ''д, з, л, н, с, т'' and ''ц''): In Ukrainian, as in Common Slavic, these letters can be both hard and soft. These letters  can never (unless they are the last letter in a prefix) be followed by an apostrophe. Furthermore, these letters can be doubled.<br/>-*'''Velars''' (''h (g), k,'' and ''x'' / ''г (ґ), к,'' and ''х''): In both Ukrainian and Common Slavic, these letters are always hard. Should they ever be followed by a iotified or soft vowel, then they undergo the first and second palatalisations. Hence, these letters can never be doubled or followed by an apostrophe.<br/>-*'''r/р''': The letter in general behaves similar to the dental category, with the following exception:<br/>-**Word finally ''r'' is always hard.<br/>-**''r'' can never be doubled.<br/>-<br/>-===Historical Phonological Changes===<br/>-In the Ukrainian language, the following sound changes have occurred between the [[Proto-Slavic|Common Slavic]] period and current Ukrainian:<br/>-<br/>-#In a newly closed syllables, that is, a syllable that ends in a consonant, Common Slavic ''o'' and ''e'' mutate into ''i'' if the next vowel in Common Slavic was one of the yers (''ǐ'' (ь) or ''ǔ'' (ъ)).<br/>-#'''[[Pleophony]]''': The Common Slavic combinations, ''ToRT'' and ''TeRT'', where ''T'' is any consonant and ''R'' is either ''r'' or ''l'' become in Ukrainian<br/>-##''TorT'' gives ''ToroT'' (Common Slavic ''*borda'' gives Ukrainian ''boroda'');<br/>-##''TolT'' gives ''ToloT'' (Common Slavic ''*bolto'' gives Ukrainian ''boloto'');<br/>-##''TerT'' gives ''TereT'' (Common Slavic ''*berza'' gives Ukrainian ''bereza''); and<br/>-##''TelT'' gives ''ToloT'' (Common Slavic ''*melko'' gives Ukrainian ''moloko'').<br/>-#In Common Slavic, the nasal vowel, ''ę'', is reflected as ''ja'' except before single labials where it is reflected as ''"ja'' ('я) and sibilants, where it is reflected as ''a.'' Examples: Common Slavic ''*pętĭ'' gives in Ukrainian ''p"jat''' (п'ять); Common Slavic ''*telę'' gives in Ukrainian ''telja''; and Common Slavic ''kyrčę'' gives in Ukrainian ''kyrča.'' Further note that this nasal vowel in Common Slavic is derived from an Indo-European, ''*-en'', ''*-em'', or the sonants ''n'' and ''m''.<br/>-#The Common Slavic letter, ě, is reflected in Ukrainian generally as ''i'' except:<br/>-##initially where it is reflected as ''ji'': Common Slavic ''*ěsti'' gives the Ukrainian ''jisty.''<br/>-##after the sibilants where it is reflected as ''a'': Common Slavic ''*ležěti'' gives the Ukrainian ''ležaty''<br/>-#Common Slavic ''i'' and ''y'' are both reflected in Ukrainian as ''y''<br/>-#The Common Slavic combination ''-CǐjV'', where ''C'' is any consonant and ''V'' is any vowel, becomes in Ukrainian the following combination ''-CCjV'', except<br/>-##if ''C'' is labial or 'r' where it becomes ''-C"jV''<br/>-##if ''V'' is the Common Slavic ''e'', then the vowel in Ukrainian mutates to ''a'' ''e.g.'' Common Slavic ''*žitĭje'' gives the Ukrainian ''žyttja''.<br/>-##if ''V'' is the Common Slavic ''ĭ'', then the combination becomes ''ej'' ''e.g.'' genitive plural in Common Slavic ''*myšĭjĭ'' give in Ukrainian ''myšej''.<br/>-##if there are one or more consonants precede the 'C' then there is no doubling of the consonants in Ukrainian.<br/>-# Common Slavic combinations ''dl'' and ''tl'' are simplified to ''l'', for example, Common Slavic ''*mydlo'' gives Ukrainian ''mylo''.<br/>-# Sonant Common Slavic ''l̥'' and ''ĺ̥'' became ''ov'', while word final ''*lǔ'' became ''v''. For example, Common Slavic ''*vĺ̥kǔ'' becomes ''vovk'' in Ukrainian<br/>-<br/>-===Current Phonological Changes===<br/>-# The First Palatalisation concerns the velars and the following vowels: ''e,'' ''y'' from Common Slavic ''i'', ''a/i'' from Common Slavic ''ě'', that is derived from the Indo-European ''ē'':<br/>-## ''h'' and ''g'' before these vowels mutates into ''ž'';<br/>-## ''k'' before these vowels mutates into ''č''; and<br/>-## ''x'' before these vowels muatates into ''š''.<br/>-# The Second Palatalisation concerns the velars and the following vowels: ''y'' from Common Slavic ''i'' that is derived from an Indo-European diphthong and ''a/i'' from Common Slavic ''ě'' that is derived from an Indo-European diphtong:<br/>-## ''h'' and ''g'' before these vowels mutates into ''z'';<br/>-## ''k'' before these vowels mutates into ''c''; and<br/>-## ''x'' before these vowels muatates into ''s''.<br/>-# The Iotification concerns all consonants and the semi-vowel ''j''/''й''. The following changes occur:<br/>-## The labials insert an ''l'' between the labial and the semi-vowel: Common Slavic ''*zemja'' give Ukrainian ''zemlja''.<br/>-## The velars followed by a semi-vowel mutate as in the first palatalisation. The semi-vowel is dropped. This change can be traced back to Common Slavic.<br/>-## ''ktj'' becomes ''č''<br/>-## ''tj'' becomes ''č''<br/>-## ''dj'' becomes ''ž'', except in verbs where it becomes ''dž''<br/>-## ''cj'' becomes ''š''<br/>-## ''ctj'' and ''ckj'' become ''šč'' (''щ'')<br/>-## ''zdj'' and ''zhj'' become ''ždž''<br/>-## ''zkj'' becomes ''žč''<br/>-## ''lj, nj, pj'' becomes ''l''', ''n''', ''p''' (that is, ''ль, нь, рь'')<br/>-# In Ukrainian, when two or more consonants occur word finally, then a float vowel is inserted under the following conditions <ref>Carlton, T.R. ''A Guide to the Declension of Nouns in Ukrainian''. Edmonton, Alberta: University of Alberta Press, 1972</ref>. Given a consonantal grouping ''C<sub>1</sub>(ь)C<sub>2</sub>(ь)'', where ''C'' is any Ukrainian consonant. The fill vowel is inserted between the two consonants and after the ''ь''. A fill vowel is only inserted if ''C<sub>2</sub>'' is one of the following consonants: ''к, в, л, м, р,'' and ''ц''. In this case:<br/>-## If ''C<sub>1</sub>'' is one of the following ''г, к,'' or ''х'', then the fill vowel is always ''о''.<br/>-## If ''C<sub>2</sub>'' is ''к'' or ''в'', then the fill vowel is ''о''. Note: no fill vowel is inserted if the ''в'' is derived from a sonant ''l'', for example, ''вовк''.<br/>-## If ''C<sub>2</sub>'' is ''л, м, р,'' or ''ц'', then the fill vowel is ''е''.<br/>-## The only known exception is ''відьм'', which should take a fill vowel, but does not.<br/>-## The combinations, ''-ств'' and ''-ськ'' are not broken up.<br/>-## If the ''C<sub>1</sub>'' is ''й'', then the above rules can apply. However, both forms (with and without the fill vowel) often exist.<br/>-<br/>-==Morphology==<br/>-===Nominal===<br/>-====Nouns====<br/>-Nominal [[declension]] is subject to seven [[declension|cases]] ([[nominative]], [[genitive]], [[dative]], [[Accusative case|accusative]], [[instrumental case|instrumental]], [[locative case|locative]], and [[vocative]]), in two numbers ([[singular]] and [[plural]]), and obeying absolutely grammatical [[gender]] ([[masculine]], [[feminine]], and [[neuter]]). The adjectives, pronouns, and the first two cardinal numbers further  vary by gender.  [[Old Ruthenian]] also had a third number, the [[Dual grammatical number|dual]], but except for its use in the nominative and accusative cases with the numbers two, three and four, eg. ('''dvi hryvni''' / '''дві гривні''', recategorized today as a genitive singular), it has been lost. Other traces of the dual can be found when referring to objects of which there are commonly two: eyes, shoulders, ears, ''e.g.'' ''plečyma''. Occassionally, dual forms can distinguish between meanings.<br/>-<br/>-In Ukrainian, there are 4 declension types.  The first declension is used for most feminine nouns.  The second declension is used for most masculine and neuter nouns.  The third declension is used for feminine nouns ending in '''ь''' or a sibilant. The fourth declension is used for neuter nouns ending in '''я/а''' (Common Slavic ''*ę'').<br/>-Most of the types consist of 3 different subgroups: hard, mixed, and soft. The soft subgroup consists of nouns whose roots end in a soft letter (followed by iotified vowel or soft vowel). The mixed subgroup consists of the nouns whose roots end in a sibilant or occassionally ''r''. The hard group consists of all other nouns.<br/>-<br/>-If the hard group endings are taken as the basis, then the following rules can be used to derived the corresponding mixed and soft endings:<br/>-*Mixed subgroup<br/>-*# All ''o'' following a sibilant change to ''e''.<br/>-*# All ''y'' following a sibilant change to ''i''.<br/>-*Soft subgroup: Whenever a soft sign or the semi-vowel encounters the vowel of the ending, the following changes occur (These are mainly orthographic changes):<br/>-*# ''ьа'' and ''йа'' gives ''я''<br/>-*# ''ьо'' gives ''е''<br/>-*# ''йо'' gives ''є''<br/>-*# ''ьи'' gives ''і''<br/>-*# ''йи'' gives ''ї''<br/>-*# ''ьу'' and ''йу'' gives ''ю''<br/>-*# ''ьі''  gives ''і''<br/>-*# ''йі'' gives ''ї''<br/>-<br/>-Nouns ending in a consonant are marked in the following tables with -0- (thus no ending).<br/>-<br/>-=====First Declension=====<br/>-<br/>-This declension consists of nouns which end in ''а'' or ''я''. It consists primarily of feminine nouns, but a few nouns with these ending referring to professions can be either masculine or feminine. In these cases, the genitive plural is often formed by adding ''-ів''. Nouns referring to people can also take this ending.<br/>-<br/>-{| class="wikitable" align=center<br/>-|+ '''First Declension: Feminine Nouns'''<br/>-| || colspan="4" align="center"|'''Singular'''<br/>-|-<br/>-! <br/>-!

This "short" form is a relic of the indefinite declension of adjectives in Common Slavic. Common examples of this anomoulous declension are ''бабин'' (masculine) compared to ''бабина'' (feminine); ''братів'' (masculine) compared to ''братова'' (feminine); and ''повинен'' (masculine) compared to ''повинна''. This ''short'' form only exists in the masculine nominative form. All other forms are regular.<br/>-<br/>-=====Declension=====<br/>-In Ukrainian, 2 different declension types: hard and soft.

In the nominative case, the nouns agrees with the last number in any compound number. Nouns which must agree with a number ending in 2, 3, or 4 are in the genitive singular or nominative plural (the forms are the same), but retain the stress of the dual. Nouns, which must agree with a number ending in 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, and all the teens are in the genitive plural. In any other case, the nouns and numbers are in the same case.<br/>-<br/>-===Verbs===<br/>-[[Grammatical conjugation]] is subject to three [[Grammatical person|persons]] in two numbers and three simple [[Grammatical tense|tenses]] (present/future, future, and past), with [[periphrasis|periphrastic]] forms for the future and [[Conditional mood|Conditional]], as well as [[imperative]] forms and present/past [[participle]]s, distinguished by [[adjective|adjectival]] and [[adverb|adverbial]] usage.  There are two [[grammatical voice|voices]], [[active voice|active]] and [[middle voice|middle]]/[[passive voice|passive]], which is constructed by the addition of a reflexive [[suffix]] '''-ся/сь''' to the active form.  An interesting feature is that the past tense is actually made to agree in gender with the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]], for it is the [[participle]] in an originally periphrastic [[perfect tense]] formed with the present of '''быть''' {{IPA|/bɨtʲ/}},"to be." Verbal inflection today is considerably simpler than in Common Slavic. The ancient [[Aorist tense|aorist]], [[imperfect tense|imperfect]], and (periphrastic) [[pluperfect]] tenses have been lost. The loss of three of the former six tenses has been offset by the reliance, as in other Slavic languages, on verbal [[grammatical aspect|aspect]].  Most verbs come in pairs, one with [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]] or continuous connotation, the other with [[perfective aspect|perfective]] or completed, usually formed with a (prepositional) prefix, but occasionally using a different root.<br/>-<br/>-The present tense of the verb '''бути''', "[[Copula|to be]]", today normally has the form, ''є'' used for all persons and numbers. Previously and occassionally in liturgical settings, aspects of the full conjugation, can be found.

Classes 1,2 and 3 correspond to the ''е'' stems of the traditional classification, while class 4 corresponds to the ''и'' stems. Class 5 consists of the athematic verbs. <ref>De Bray, R. G. A.

The active voice is the only voice with a complete set of conjugations. The active voice, in general, shows a direct effect of the verb on its subject.<br/>-<br/>-====Indicative Active Mood====<br/>-The [[indicative mood]] is used to describe events, which have, are, or will occur. In Ukrainian, the indicative mood contains a present, future, and past tenses.<br/>-<br/>-=====Present tense=====<br/>-Historically, this is derived from the Indo-European present tense. In Common Slavic and later Ukrainian, it retained its present meaning only for imperfective verbs and developed a future meaning for perfective verbs.<br/>-<br/>-For the ''е'' stems (Classes 1, 2, and 3), the endings are:<br/>-<br/>-{| class="wikitable"<br/>-|+ '''е stem endings'''<br/>-! <br/>-! singular<br/>-! plural<br/>-|-<br/>-| '''First Person''' || -у / -ю || -емо / -ємо <br/>-|-<br/>-| '''Second Person''' || -еш / -єш ||-ете / -єте <br/>-|-<br/>-| '''Third Person''' || -е / -є || -уть / -ють<br/>-|}<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-All verbs whose roots end in a velar undergo the first palatalisation in all forms of the present (even though historically speaking the first person singular should not). The endings in ''є'' are used for roots whose stem ends in a vowel. All verbs in Class 3 and those which end in a vowel use ''-ю'' and ''-ють''. Furthermore, Class 3 verbs undergo iotification in those forms which use ''-ю-''. For reflexive verbs, in the third person singular, the ending has its historical ''-ть'' restored before the participle ''-ся / -сь'' is affixed. Thus, the ending becomes ''-еться''.<br/>-<br/>-For the ''и'' stems (Class 4), the endings are: <br/>-<br/>-<br/>-{| class="wikitable"<br/>-|+ '''и stem endings'''<br/>-! <br/>-! singular<br/>-! plural<br/>-|-<br/>-| '''First Person''' ||  -ю / (-у) || -имо / -їмо <br/>-|-<br/>-| '''Second Person''' || -иш / -їш ||-ите / -їте <br/>-|-<br/>-| '''Third Person''' || -ить / -їть || -ать / -ять<br/>-|}<br/>-<br/>-All Class 4 verbs undergo iotofication in the first person singular. Thus, there is really only one ending, which due to orthographic reasons is given 2 different forms. Verbs ending in a vowel take the endings in the second column. In the thirsd person plural, verbs ending in a labial insert an ''л'' before the ending, ''-ять''. The ending ''-ать'' is used after the sibilants ''ж, ш, щ'', or ''ч''.<br/>-<br/>-======Examples======<br/>-{| class="wikitable"<br/>-|+ '''нести (stem: нес-) (Class 1 verb)'''<br/>-'''<br/>-! <br/>-! colspan="2" |singular<br/>-! colspan="2" |plural<br/>-|-<br/>-| || Ukrainian || English || Ukrainian || English<br/>-|-<br/>-| '''First Person''' ||  несу || I am carrying || несемо || We are carrying <br/>-|-<br/>-| '''Second Person''' || несеш || You (sing.) are carrying || несете || You (pl.)  are carrying <br/>-|-<br/>-| '''Third Person''' || несе || He/She/It is carrying || несуть || They are carrying<br/>-|}<br/>-<br/>-{| class="wikitable"<br/>-|+ '''вернути (stem: верн-) (Class 2 verb)'''<br/>-'''<br/>-! <br/>-! colspan="2" |singular<br/>-! colspan="2" |plural<br/>-|-<br/>-| || Ukrainian || English || Ukrainian || English<br/>-|-<br/>-| '''First Person''' ||  верну || I will return || вернемо || We will return <br/>-|-<br/>-| '''Second Person''' || вернеш || You (sing.) will return || вернете || You (pl.) will return <br/>-|-<br/>-| '''Third Person''' || верне || He/She/It will return || вернуть || They will return<br/>-|}<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-{| class="wikitable"<br/>-|+ '''читати (stem: чита-) (Class 3 verb)''' <br/>-! <br/>-! colspan="2" |singular<br/>-! colspan="2" |plural<br/>-|-<br/>-| || Ukrainian || English || Ukrainian || English<br/>-|-<br/>-| '''First Person''' ||  читаю || I read || читаємо || We read<br/>-|-<br/>-| '''Second Person''' || читаєш || You (sing.) read || читаєте || You (pl.) read<br/>-|-<br/>-| '''Third Person''' || читає || He/She/It reads || читають || They read<br/>-|}<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-{| class="wikitable"<br/>-|+ '''говорити - (stem: говор-) (Class 4 verb)'''<br/>-! <br/>-! colspan="2" |singular<br/>-! colspan="2" |plural<br/>-|-<br/>-| || Ukrainian || English || Ukrainian || English<br/>-|-<br/>-| '''First Person''' ||  говорю || I talk || говоримо || We talk<br/>-|-<br/>-| '''Second Person''' || говориш || You (sing.) talk || говорите || You (pl.) talk<br/>-|-<br/>-| '''Third Person''' || говорить || He/She/It talks || говорять || They talk<br/>-|}<br/>-<br/>-======[[Athematic verb]]s======<br/>-Ukrainian inherited from Indo-European through Common Slavic, the following 3 athematic verbs. These verbs have their own conjugation in the present. Everywhere else they are regular.<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-{| class="wikitable"<br/>-|+ '''дати - to give (perfective)'''<br/>-! <br/>-! singular<br/>-! plural<br/>-|-<br/>-| '''First Person''' || дам || дамо <br/>-|-<br/>-| '''Second Person''' || даси ||дасте <br/>-|-<br/>-| '''Third Person''' || дасть || дадуть<br/>-|}<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-{| class="wikitable"<br/>-|+ '''їсти - to eat (imperfective)'''<br/>-! <br/>-! singular<br/>-! plural<br/>-|-<br/>-| '''First Person''' || їм || їмо <br/>-|-<br/>-| '''Second Person''' || їси ||їсте <br/>-|-<br/>-| '''Third Person''' || їсть || їдять<br/>-|}<br/>-<br/>-{| class="wikitable"<br/>-|+ '''Compounds ending in -вісти'''<br/>-! <br/>-! singular<br/>-! plural<br/>-|-<br/>-| '''First Person''' || -вім || -вімо <br/>-|-<br/>-| '''Second Person''' || -віси ||-вісте <br/>-|-<br/>-| '''Third Person''' || -вість || -відять<br/>-|}<br/>-<br/>-=====Past Active Tense=====<br/>-The past tense in Ukrainian has the pecularity of being originally an adjective, since it derives from the original compound perfect tense. Thus, the past tense agrees in number and gender with the subject of the verb. The following endings are added to the infinitive with the ending ''-ти'' removed (Most root final ''д'' and ''т'' are dropped):<br/>-<br/>-*masculine singular: ''-в''<br/>-**Note: It is lost after ''с, з, к, г, б, р''.<br/>-*feminine singular: ''-ла''<br/>-*neuter singular: ''-ло''<br/>-*plural: ''-ли''<br/>-<br/>-These forms are often called the active past participle I.<br/>-<br/>-=====Future Active Tense=====<br/>-In Ukrainian, there are 2 different future tenses for imperfective verbs. The first form formed by adding to the infinitive of the verb the following endings, which are derived from the Common Slavic verb ''*jĭmati'' (Ukrainian мати):<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-{| class="wikitable"<br/>-|+ ''' Futre Tense: First Form'''<br/>-! <br/>-! colspan="2" |singular<br/>-! colspan="2" |plural<br/>-|-<br/>-| || Ending || Example || Ending || Example<br/>-|-<br/>-| '''First Person''' ||  -му ||їстиму|| -мо || їстимо<br/>-|-<br/>-| '''Second Person''' || -меш || їстимеш ||-мете || їстимете <br/>-|-<br/>-| '''Third Person''' || -ме || їстиме ||  -муть || їстимуть<br/>-|}<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-The second form, commonly used in speach, is to take the present tense conjugation of the verb ''бути'' and use it with the infinitive of the verb. Thus,<br/>-<br/>-{| class="wikitable"<br/>-|+ '''Future Tense: Second Form'''<br/>-! <br/>-! singular<br/>-! plural<br/>-|-<br/>-| '''First Person''' ||  буду їсти|| будемо їсти<br/>-|-<br/>-| '''Second Person''' || будеш їсти || будете їсти <br/>-|-<br/>-| '''Third Person''' || буде їсти || будуть їсти<br/>-|}<br/>-<br/>-This will translate as ''will eat'' with the appropriate personal pronoun.<br/>-<br/>-====Imperative Active Mood====<br/>-The [[grammatical mood#imperative mood|imperative mood]] is used to give commands. It exists in only the present tense in Ukrainian. There are no forms for the 1<sup>st</sup> person singular. <br/>-In Ukrainian, the imperative mood is formed from the stem of the verb plus the following endings (The example is based on Ukrainian ''пити''):<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-{| class="wikitable" <br/>-|+ '''Imperative Mood in Ukrainian'''<br/>-! <br/>-! singular<br/>-! plural<br/>-|-<br/>-| '''First Person''' || ''none'' || -ьмо / -ймо / -мо / -імо (пиймо)<br/>-|-<br/>-| '''Second Person''' || -ь / -й / -0- / -и (пий) ||-ьте / -йте / -те / -іть (пийте) <br/>-|-<br/>-| '''Third Person''' || нехай + 3<sup>rd</sup> person present singular (нехай п'є)  ||нехай + 3<sup>rd</sup> person present plural (нехай п'ють)<br/>-|}<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-The first set of endings is to be used for stems that end in a dentals (''з, д, т, с, н,'' and ''л''). The second set of ending is used for stems that end in a vowel. The third set of endings is used for stems that end in labials or sibilants (''б, в, м, п, ф, ш, щ, ч, ж,'' and ''р''). The fourth set of endings is used with verbs whose unaffixed form (no prefixes or suffixes) has the stress on the ending in the first person singular of the present tense. Thus for example, ''бери'' and ''вибери''.<br/>-<br/>-Finally note that all verbs with stems that end in ''к'' and ''г'' undergo the first palatalisation. Class 3 verbs with stems in ''к'', ''г'', and ''с'' undergo iotification (as do their present conjugation).<br/>-<br/>-====Conditional Active Mood====<br/>-The [[grammatical mood#conditional mood|conditional mood]] is used to state hypothetical states, wishes, and desires. It has 2 tenses in Ukrainian: a present and a past.<br/>-<br/>-=====Present Tense=====<br/>-The present conditional is formed in Ukrainian from the particple ''би'', which is derived from the archaic aorist conjugation of the verb, ''бути'', and the active past participle I, which is the same as the past indicative participle. Thus, there is agreement between the subject and the participle. An example of this construction would be ''я би хотів...'' (I would like...).<br/>-<br/>-=====Past Tense=====<br/>-The past conditional is formed in Ukrainian from the particple ''би'' followed by the active past participle I form of the verb ''бути'' (''був, була, було, були'') and then the active past participle I of the verb. Both participles must agree with the subject. An example of this construction would be ''як я би був знав...'' (had I  (had) known...). <br/>-<br/>-====Passive Voice====<br/>-The [[passive voice]] has 2 different functions. It can either show that the subject had something done to itself or that something indeteminate occurred to the subject.<br/>-In Ukrainian, the passive voice is formed as follows:<br/>-# Use of a reflexive verb: ''митися'' (to wash oneself or in French ''se laver'')<br/>-#Use of the verb ''to be'' and the past passive participle: ''Він був забитий'' (He was killed).<br/>-# An impersonal use of the third person plural past active participle I: ''Його забили'' (He was killed).<br/>-# The following construction: ''Було'' + neuter singular of past passive participle: ''Місто було добуте'' (The town was capture.).<br/>-<br/>-====Participles and Verbal Nouns====<br/>-<br/>-In Ukrainian, there exist traces of all 5 Common Slavic particples.<br/>-<br/>-=====Present Active Participle=====<br/>-<br/>-This participle is formed by taking the third person plural form, dropping the ''ть'', and adding ''чи(й)''. Most commonly this participle is used as gerund with the form ''чи'' with a meaning approaching the equivalent English construction with ''-ing''. Occassionally, it is used as an adjective. It this case its form is ''чий''. Examples of this particple are ''несучи'', ''знаючи'', and ''хвалячи''.<br/>-<br/>-=====Present Passive Participle=====<br/>-<br/>-This participle does not exist in Ukrainian as a separate form. However, it is commonly encountered as an adjective in ''-мий''. Common examples of this participle are ''відомий'' and ''знайомий''.<br/>-<br/>-=====Past Active Participle I=====<br/>-<br/>-This participle is encountered in forming the past tense in Ukrainian. Occassionally, it is found as an adjective for intransitive verbs. It is formed by taking the infinitive stem and adding the ending ''-в, -ла, -ло,'' and ''-ли'' to form the past tense participle (in reality the indefinite form of the adjective) and the ending ''-лий'' to form the regular adjective. An example of the adjectival form is ''почорнілий''.<br/>-<br/>-=====Past Active Participle II=====<br/>-<br/>-This participle is most commonly encondered as a gerund, while it is only used occassionally as an adjective. It is formed by taking the masculine past participle I and adding the ending ''-ши(й)''. An example of the gerund is ''знавши'', while an extremely common adjective would the word ''бувший''.<br/>-<br/>-=====Past Passive Participle=====<br/>-<br/>-This participle is the only participle that is is commonly used as an adjective. It has 2 different methods of formation. Take the infinitive stem, add ''а/е'', and then either add ''-тий'' or ''-ний''. Class 4 verbs undergo iotification. There does not seem to be any difference between the 2 methods of forming the participles. This participle can roughly be translated using the English past participle. Examples of this participle are ''жатий'', ''посланий'', ''печений'', and ''лишений''.<br/>-<br/>-=====Verbal Noun=====<br/>-<br/>-The verbal noun is created by taking the past passive participle, dropping ''ий'', doubling the consonant if permitted by the rules under ''-ĭjV'', and adding a ''я''. This will be a neuter noun declined like all neuter nouns in ''*ĭjе''. It should be noted that if the ''-е-'' of the past passive participle is stressed then the ''е'' will mutate into an ''і''. Examples include ''питання'' from ''питати'' and ''носіння'' from ''носити''.<br/>-<br/>-The verbal noun in Ukrainian is derived from the Common Slavic verbal noun, where it was formed by adding ''*-ĭjе'' to the past passive participle without the ''*ŭ'' ending. Thus, in Ukrainian, the consonant is doubled if possible.<br/>- <br/>-===Word formation===<br/>-Ukrainian has on hand a set of [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefixes]], [[preposition|prepositional]] and [[adverb|adverbial]] in nature, as well as [[diminutive]], [[augmentative]], and [[frequentative]] [[suffix|suffixes]] and [[infix|infixes]]. All of these can be stacked one upon the other, to produce multiple derivatives of a given word.  Participles and other inflexional forms may also have a special [[connotation]].  <br/>-<br/>-===Fundamental sentence structure===<br/>-====Coordination====<br/>-The common Ukrainain [[coordination]]s are:<br/>-* і (and)<br/>-* та (and)<br/>-* али (but)<br/>-<br/>-====Subordination====<br/>-Common Ukrainian subordinations are:<br/>-<br/>-* як (how, if)<br/>-* коли (when)<br/>-<br/>-==Syntax==<br/>-The basic word order, both in conversation and the written language, is '''[[Subject Verb Object]]'''.  However, because the relations are marked by inflexion, considerable latitude in word order is allowed, and all the permutations can be used.  The word order expresses the logical stress, and the degree of definiteness. <br/>-<br/>-=== Negation ===<br/>-Unlike English, Latin, and various other languages, Ukrainian allows multiple negatives, as in '''ніхто ніколи нікому нічого не прощає''' "No-one ever forgives anything to anyone" (literally, "no-one never to no-one nothing not forgives").<br/>-<br/>-===Inflectional usage===<br/>-====Case====<br/>-The use of cases in Ukrainian can be very complicated. In general, the nominative, genitive, accusative, and vocative cases can be used without a preposition. On the other hand, the locative and instrumental cases are used primarily with preposition. Furthermore and much like in [[Latin]], different prepositions can be followed by nouns in different cases, which results in different meanings.<br/>-<br/>-====Tense and aspect====<br/>-Ukrainian has two "aspects" of its verb form, depending on how the action is performed. These are called the '''imperfective''' and '''perfective''' forms. The imperfective form denotes action is taking place in the present, is ongoing, is repetitive, or is habitual. The perfective form indicates completion, the result of an action, beginning of an action, or actions that are shorter or longer than usual. E.g., '''спати''' is imperfective; '''поспати''' is perfective.<br/>-<br/>-==See also==<br/>-* [[Ukrainian language]]<br/>-==Translation of Words==<br/>-Note: All Common Slavic words quoted are translated faithfully by their Ukrainian forms.<br/>-Abreviations used: <br/>-* m: masculine noun<br/>-* f: feminine noun<br/>-* nt: neuter noun<br/>-* n: noun declined like an adjective, with different forms for each gender<br/>-* v: verb<br/>-* adj: adjective<br/>-* adv: adverb<br/>-* ger: gerund<br/>-* pr: pronoun<br/>-* co: cojunction<br/>-<br/>-{{col-begin}}<br/>-{{col-break|width=50%}}<br/>-* бабин (babyn): (adj) belonging to a grandmother (masculine nominative form)<br/>-* бабина (babyna): (adj) belonging to a grandmother (feminine nominative form) <br/>-* береза (bereza): (f) birch<br/>-* бити (byty): (v) to hit<br/>-* болото (boloto): (nt) mud, swamp<br/>-* борода (boroda): (f) beard<br/>-* брати (braty): (nt) to take<br/>-* братів (brativ): (adj) belonging to a brother (masculine nominative form)<br/>-* братова (bratova): (adj) belong to a brother (feminien nominative form)<br/>-* бувший (buvšyj): (adj) former, ex- (that which once was)<br/>-* бути (buty): (v) to be<br/>-* ваш (vaš): (adj) yours (pl)<br/>-* вернути (vernuty): (v) to return something<br/>-* вертіти (vertity): (v) to turn about repeatedly<br/>-* вибрати (vybraty): (v) to choose, elect<br/>-* відомий (vidomyj): (adj) well-known<br/>-* відьм (vid'm): (f) witches (genitive plural)<br/>-* вовк (vovk): (m) wolf<br/>-* гарний (harnyj): (adj) nice<br/>-* гарно (harno): (adv) nicely<br/>-* говорити (hovoryty): (v) to speak<br/>-* гривня ([[hryvnia]]): (f) Ukrainian currency<br/>-* двигнути (dvyhnyty): (v) to exert<br/>-* думати (dumaty): (v) to think<br/>-* жатий (žatyj): (adj) harvested<br/>-* жовтіти (žovtity): (v) to turn yellow<br/>-* земля (zemlja): (f) earth<br/>-* знати (znaty): (v) to know<br/>-* знайомий (znajomyj): (adj) friendly (known); (n) friend<br/>-* знавши (znavšy): (ger) having known<br/>-* знаючи (znajučy): (ger) knowing <br/>-* ім'я (im"ja): (nt) name<br/>-* їсти (jisty): (v) to eat<br/>-* їхний (jixnyj): (adj) theirs<br/>-* купувати (kupuvaty): (v) to buy<br/>-* курча (kurča): (nt) baby chicken<br/>-* лежати (ležaty): (v) to lie in some given place<br/>-* лити (lyty): (v) to pour<br/>-* лишений (lyšenyj): (adj) left<br/>-* мати (maty): (v) to have<br/>-* мило (mylo): (nt) soap<br/>-<br/>-{{col-break|width=50%}}<br/>-<br/>-* мій (mij): (adj) mine<br/>-* молоко (moloko): (nt) milk<br/>-* молоти (moloty): (v) to grind<br/>-* наш (naš): (adj) ours<br/>-* ніч (nič): (f) night<br/>-* нести (necty): (v) to carry<br/>-* несучи(й) (nesučy(j)): (ger) carrying; (adj) that which is being carried <br/>-* носити (nosyty): (v) to carry<br/>-* носіння (nosinnja): (nt) act of carrying <br/>-* орати (oraty): (v) to plow<br/>-* пекти (nekty): (v) to bake<br/>-* печений (pečehyj): (adj) baked<br/>-* питати (pytaty): (v) to ask<br/>-* питання (pytannja): (nt) question<br/>-* пити (pyty): (v) to drink<br/>-* плечима (plečyma): (nt) shoulders (instrumental plural form)<br/>-* плисти (plysty): (v) to float<br/>-* повинен (povynen): (adj) required to be done (often translated using the verb, should) (masculine nominative form)<br/>-* повинна (povynna): (adj) required to be done (feminine nominative form)<br/>-* полоти (poloty): (v) to weed<br/>-* посланий (poclanyj): (adj) sent<br/>-* попросити (poprosyty): (v) to ask for something<br/>-* поспати (pospaty): (v) to nap<br/>-* почати (počaty): (v) to start<br/>-* почорнілий (počorhilyj): (adj) having been blackened<br/>-* рвати (rvaty): (v) to rip<br/>-* свято (svjato): (nt) holiday<br/>-* сіяти (sijaty): (v) to plant / seed<br/>-* спати (spaty): (v) to sleep<br/>-* твій (tvij): (adj) yours (sing.)<br/>-* теля (telja): (nt) baby lamb<br/>-* умерти (umerty): (v) to die (animate)<br/>-* хвалити (xvalyty): (v) to praise<br/>-* хвалячи (xvaljačy): (ger) praising<br/>-* хотіти (xotity): (v) to want, desire<br/>-* хто (xto): (pr) who<br/>-* чий (čyj): (adj) whose<br/>-* читати (čytaty): (v) to read<br/>-* що (ščo): (pr) what<br/>-* як (jak): (co) if<br/>-{{col-end}}<br/>-<br/>-==Footnotes==<br/>-<div class="references-small" style="-moz-column-count:2; column-count:2;"><br/>-<references /><br/>-</div><br/>-==References==<br/>-* ''Український Правопис'' 4th editon Kiev, 1993.<br/>-* De Bray, R.
