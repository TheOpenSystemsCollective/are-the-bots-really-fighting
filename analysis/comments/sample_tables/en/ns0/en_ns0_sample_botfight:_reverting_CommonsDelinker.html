On 9 July 1921, a truce was declared. On 11 October negotiations were opened under British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] and Arthur Griffith, who headed the Irish Republic's delegation.  The Irish Treaty delegation set up Headquarters in [[Hans Place]], Knightsbridge and on 5 December 1921 at 11:15 am it was decided by the delegation during private discussions at 22 Hans Place to recommend the Treaty to the Dáil Éireann; negotiations continued until 2:30 am on 6 December 1921 after which the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty|Treaty]] was signed by the parties.<br/> <br/>-<br/>+[[File:Michael Collins "Free State Demonstration" March 13, 1922.jpg|thumb|[[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] addressing a crowd in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] at a "Free State Demonstration" on 13 March 1922.]]<br/> That these negotiations would produce a form of Irish government short of the independence wished for by republicans was not in doubt. The United Kingdom could not offer a republican form of government without losing prestige and risking demands for something similar throughout the Empire. Furthermore, as one of the negotiators, [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], later admitted (and he was in a position to know, given his role in the independence war), the IRA at the time of the truce was weeks, if not days, from collapse, with a chronic shortage of ammunition. "Frankly, we thought they were mad", Collins said of the sudden British offer of a truce, although it was likely they would have continued in one form or another, given the level of public support. The [[President of the Irish Republic|President of the Republic]], Éamon de Valera, realising that a republic was not on offer, decided not to be a part of the treaty delegation and so be tainted by more militant republicans as a "sellout". Yet his own proposals published in January 1922 fell far short of an autonomous all-Ireland republic.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}<br/> <br/> As expected, the Anglo-Irish Treaty explicitly ruled out a republic. What it offered was [[dominion]] status, as a state of the British Commonwealth, equal to Canada, Newfoundland, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. Though less than expected by the Sinn Féin leadership, it was substantially more than the initial form of home rule within the United Kingdom sought by [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] from 1880, and a serious advancement on the Home Rule Act of 1914 that the Irish nationalist leader [[John Redmond]] had achieved through parliamentary proceedings. However, it all but confirmed the [[partition of Ireland]] between [[Northern Ireland]] and the Irish Free State. It was ratified by the [[Second Dáil]], splitting Sinn Féin in the process.</td>

Navies conduct live fire exercises to test elements of an integrated defense system such as the US [[Aegis combat system|Aegis]]; namely its ability to track and destroy enemy [[anti-ship missile]]s. Tests can also include an integrated defense system’s compatibility to fire new missiles or newer versions of the same missile. Live fire tests are also conducted with a [[CIWS]] system, which is designed as the last line of defense for a ship. Surface ships also frequently testfire the various guns kept and maintained aboard the vessel, these can range from side arms and rifles up to the [[16"/50 caliber Mark 7 gun|16" guns]] of the mothballed US [[Iowa class battleship|''Iowa''-class battleships]]. This is done to maintain the skill and knowledge needed to operate the weapon.

The best known tests of torpedoes are those conducted against a derelict ship, typically on ships from a Navy's own [[reserve fleet|mothball fleet]] that has become too old or obsolete to warrant maintaining. The purpose of these tests is to ensure that the torpedo will work under combat conditions, and such tests can be used to determine whether or not [[noisemaker]]s or other [[decoy]]s will have any effect against the unit when launched.<br/> <br/> ===Use against training soldiers===</td>

[[The Band]]'s 1970 release ''[[Stage Fright (album)|Stage Fright]]'' with [[Norman Seeff]]'s photograph as a poster insert is an early example with the poster quickly becoming a collector's item. [[Gatefold|Gatefold cover]]s, (a folded double cover), and inserts, often with lyric sheets, made the album cover a desirable artifact in its own right. Notable examples are [[The Beatles]]' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' which had cut-out inserts, lyrics, a gatefold sleeve even though it was a single album, [[The Rolling Stones]]' ''[[Exile on Main Street]]'' which had a gatefold and a series of 12 perforated postcards as inserts (also by photographer [[Norman Seeff]]), and [[Pink Floyd]]'s ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' which had a gatefold, lyrics, no title on the sleeve and poster and sticker inserts. The move to the small (less than 1/4 the size of a record) CD format lost that impact, though attempts have been made to create a more desirable packaging for the CD format, for example the re-issue of ''Sgt. Pepper'', which had a cardboard box and booklet, or the use of oversized packaging.<br/>-<br/>+[[File:Are You Experienced - US cover-edit.jpg|thumb|''[[Are You Experienced]]'', [[Jimi Hendrix Experience]]]]<br/> The importance of cover design was such that some artists specialised or gained fame through their work, notably the design team [[Hipgnosis]] (through their work on [[Pink Floyd]] albums, amongst others) and [[Roger Dean (artist)|Roger Dean]] famous for his [[Yes (band)|Yes]] and [[Greenslade]] covers, [[Cal Schenkel]] for [[Captain Beefheart]]'s ''[[Trout Mask Replica]]'' and [[Frank Zappa]]'s ''[[We're Only in It for the Money]]''.<br/> <br/> The talents of many photographers and illustrators from both inside and outside of the music industry have been used to produce a vast array of memorable LP/CD covers. Photographer [[Mick Rock]] produced some of the most iconographic album covers of the 1970s, including [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s ''[[Queen II]]'' (recreated for their classic music video [[Bohemian Rhapsody]]), [[Syd Barrett]]'s ''[[The Madcap Laughs]]'', and [[Lou Reed]]'s ''[[Transformer (album)|Transformer]]''.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6613107.stm Photographer lives the Rock dream] BBC News. Retrieved May 26, 2011</ref> From 1972 to 1975, photographer [[Norman Seeff]] was Creative Director at [[United Artists]] and in addition to his many cover photographs ([[The Band]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]'s [[Hotter than Hell]], [[Joni Mitchell]]'s [[Hejira (album)|Hejira]] etc.), he art directed dozens of album covers including [[Exile on Main Street]], many of which received [[Grammy]] nominations.

Samuelson experimented with different positions on the skis for several days until 2 July 1922. Samuelson discovered that leaning backwards in the water with ski tips up and poking out of the water at the tip was the optimal method. His brother Ben towed him and they reached a speed of {{convert|20|mph|km/h}}.<ref name=ABC-history/> Samuelson also achieved the first ski jump on 8 July 1925 using a greased {{convert|4|by|16|ft|m}} ramp. Samuelson spent 15 years performing shows and teaching water skiing to people in the United States. Experimenting further with the sport, Samuelson hooked up a line behind a [[World War 2]] flying boat with 200 horsepower and reached a speed of 80 miles per hour, making him the first speed skier.<br/> <br/> Samuelson went through several iterations of equipment in his quest to ski on water. His first equipment consisted of barrel staves for skis.<ref name=ABC-history>{{cite web|title=History of Water Skiing|url=http://www.abc-of-skiing.com/water-skiing/history.asp|work=ABC of Skiing|publisher=MaxLifestyle International Inc.}}</ref> He later tried [[Ski|snow skis]],<ref name=ABC-history/> but finally fabricated his own design out of lumber with bindings made of strips of leather. The ski rope was made from a long [[Sash window|window sash]].<ref name=ABC-history/> Samuelson never patented any of his ski equipment. The first patent for water skis was issued to Fred Waller, of Huntington, NY, on 27 October 1925, for skis he developed independently and marketed as "Dolphin Akwa-Skees." Waller's skis were constructed of kiln-dried mahogany, as were some boats at that time. Jack Andresen patented the first trick ski, a shorter, fin-less water ski, in 1940.</td>
