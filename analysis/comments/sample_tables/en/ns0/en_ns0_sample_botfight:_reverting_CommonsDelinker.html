Conspicuous white [[rhizomorph]]s extend from the base of this structure and help to anchor it in the soil. The outer tissue layer, or [[peridium]], is white to pale, smooth, firm-membranous. The slimy [[spore]] mass, or [[gleba]], is attached to outer surface of the [[pileus (mycology)|cap]], and is colored dark olivaceous to blackish brown. The [[stipe (mycology)|stalks]] of ''Phallus'' mushrooms are called ''receptacles'': they are upright, cylindrical, hollow, spongy, and bearing roughly bell-shaped cap with irregularly branching ridges on the outer surface. Some species have an ''indusium'', a net-like structure that extends from the cap to the ground.<ref name=Pegler1995/> The gleba is slimy and pale greenish-yellow; in several species the gleba has a foul, [[carrion]]-like odor, which attracts insects that then help disperse the spores. [[Mosquito]]es, however, that feed on the gleba are killed, suggesting the fungus may contain compounds that could be used as an attractant or [[biocontrol]] agent.<ref name=Gardezi1992/><br/> <br/> The spores of ''Phallus'' species are small, [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]], and somewhat translucent ([[hyaline]]).<ref name=Pegler1995/> The spores of various Phallaceae species, including ''P.&nbsp;ravenelii'' has been shown to be smooth and featureless using [[scanning electron microscopy]]. Roughened spore surfaces are considered by some mycologists to be an adaptation that results in friction during travel in the air, and increase dispersal distances. ''Phallus'' spores are not airborne at any time in their life cycle.<ref name=Burk1982/></td>

Realising the importance of B Company's previous position to a planned counter-offensive, two hours after their withdrawal, Ferguson order Laughlin to re-occupy the position which they had just vacated. 27th Brigade would now be reinforced by American troops and their move forward would be facilitated if the Chinese were cleared from the small hill that commanded the road through the valley. Likewise, the defence of this position the previous evening had prevented a Chinese assault on the western flank of Hill 504. As such at 09:30 the order to withdraw was rescinded and B Company were tasked to re-occupy the position. In preparation for the company assault on the summit, Laughlin tasked 5 Platoon to assault a small knoll halfway between C Company and the old B Company position. A frontal assault was launched at 10:30, with two sections attacking and one in fire support. Strongly held by a Chinese platoon well dug-in in bunkers, the defenders allowed the Australians to approach to within {{convert|15|m|yd}} before opening fire with machine-guns, rifles and grenades. 5 Platoon suffered seven casualties, including the platoon commander, and they were forced to withdraw under the cover of machine-gun and mortar fire.<ref name=ONeill149/></td>

Samuelson experimented with different positions on the skis for several days until 2 July 1922. Samuelson discovered that leaning backwards in the water with ski tips up and poking out of the water at the tip was the optimal method. His brother Ben towed him and they reached a speed of {{convert|20|mph|km/h}}.<ref name=ABC-history/> Samuelson also achieved the first ski jump on 8 July 1925 using a greased {{convert|4|by|16|ft|m}} ramp. Samuelson spent 15 years performing shows and teaching water skiing to people in the United States. Experimenting further with the sport, Samuelson hooked up a line behind a [[World War 2]] flying boat with 200 horsepower and reached a speed of 80 miles per hour, making him the first speed skier.<br/> <br/> Samuelson went through several iterations of equipment in his quest to ski on water. His first equipment consisted of barrel staves for skis.<ref name=ABC-history>{{cite web|title=History of Water Skiing|url=http://www.abc-of-skiing.com/water-skiing/history.asp|work=ABC of Skiing|publisher=MaxLifestyle International Inc.}}</ref> He later tried [[Ski|snow skis]],<ref name=ABC-history/> but finally fabricated his own design out of lumber with bindings made of strips of leather.

The first patent for water skis was issued to Fred Waller, of Huntington, NY, on 27 October 1925, for skis he developed independently and marketed as "Dolphin Akwa-Skees." Waller's skis were constructed of kiln-dried mahogany, as were some boats at that time. Jack Andresen patented the first trick ski, a shorter, fin-less water ski, in 1940.</td>

Navies conduct live fire exercises to test elements of an integrated defense system such as the US [[Aegis combat system|Aegis]]; namely its ability to track and destroy enemy [[anti-ship missile]]s. Tests can also include an integrated defense system’s compatibility to fire new missiles or newer versions of the same missile. Live fire tests are also conducted with a [[CIWS]] system, which is designed as the last line of defense for a ship.

This is done to maintain the skill and knowledge needed to operate the weapon.

The best known tests of torpedoes are those conducted against a derelict ship, typically on ships from a Navy's own [[reserve fleet|mothball fleet]] that has become too old or obsolete to warrant maintaining. The purpose of these tests is to ensure that the torpedo will work under combat conditions, and such tests can be used to determine whether or not [[noisemaker]]s or other [[decoy]]s will have any effect against the unit when launched.<br/> <br/> ===Use against training soldiers===</td>

Also the songs "Roadrunner," "It Ain't What You Do," "I Will Stay" and "The Phone Rang" were classics. ''Roadrunner'' was recorded in Stockholm at Marcus Music Studios, and the album was also pressed in Stockholm. ''Roadrunner'' can be considered as one of the major Finnish rock albums, and it was Finland's best-selling album by a Finnish band in from 1974 until 1985, when the [[Dingo (band)|Dingos]]' ''Kerjäläisten valtakunta'' exceeded the volume of sales. Also the album cover art (by Risto Vuorimies) has become a classic: it was the only Finnish album cover in 1977's Hipgnosisin and Roger Dean's work Album Cover Album (Dragons, World Book). The ''Roadrunner'' cover was designed by Kari Korhonen, who also made a [[Donald Duck]] ("Rokkikukot") comic book version of the album cover. ''Roadrunner'' is still considered one of Finnish rock music's most important albums, and it is Finland's seventh-best-selling album of all time. The cover's stylish motif was chosen by Hurriganes' bassist Cisse Häkkinen, who owned a light blue 1954 Cadillac Series 62 sedan. The cover shows the Hurriganes' Remu Aaltonen, Cisse Häkkinen and Albert Järvinen posing elegantly in suits sitting on the back seat of the Cadillac. The car ended up in the ownership of Kari Niiranen, or "DJ Nite," a highly popular disc jockey who also toured with Hurriganes. ''Roadrunner'' is regarded as one of the best Finnish rock records ever released, and in 2007, it was re-released as a SACD mixed to a 5.1 format.<br/> <br/> ==Crazy Days: Kallio returns (1975)==</td>

A small detachment of 14 men, led by [[Second Lieutenant]] Brian Barrett-Hamilton, was then stationed on attachment to the British Army in [[Bahrain]] in June 1961, and remained there for two months. The [[Congo Crisis]] led to the Battalion's first full mobilisation on 9 September 1961, when it was detailed to man the border between [[Northern Rhodesia]] and Katanga. The companies were deployed separately in the border towns of [[Chingola]], [[Kitwe]], [[Chililabombwe|Bancroft]] and [[Mufulira]], and proceeded to run checkpoints and assist refugees who crossed the border.

The best known tests of torpedoes are those conducted against a derelict ship, typically on ships from a Navy's own [[reserve fleet|mothball fleet]] that has become too old or obsolete to warrant maintaining. The purpose of these tests is to ensure that the torpedo will work under combat conditions, and such tests can be used to determine whether or not [[noisemaker]]s or other [[decoy]]s will have any effect against the unit when launched.<br/> <br/> ===Use against training soldiers===</td>

Under the influence of designers like [[Bob Cato]] who at various stages in his long music career was vice president of creative services at both [[Columbia Records]] and [[United Artists]], album covers became renowned for being a marketing tool and an expression of artistic intent. [[The Band]]'s 1970 release ''[[Stage Fright (album)|Stage Fright]]'' with [[Norman Seeff]]'s photograph as a poster insert is an early example with the poster quickly becoming a collector's item. [[Gatefold|Gatefold cover]]s, (a folded double cover), and inserts, often with lyric sheets, made the album cover a desirable artifact in its own right. Notable examples are [[The Beatles]]' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' which had cut-out inserts, lyrics, a gatefold sleeve even though it was a single album, [[The Rolling Stones]]' ''[[Exile on Main Street]]'' which had a gatefold and a series of 12 perforated postcards as inserts (also by photographer [[Norman Seeff]]), and [[Pink Floyd]]'s ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' which had a gatefold, lyrics, no title on the sleeve and poster and sticker inserts. The move to the small (less than 1/4 the size of a record) CD format lost that impact, though attempts have been made to create a more desirable packaging for the CD format, for example the re-issue of ''Sgt. Pepper'', which had a cardboard box and booklet, or the use of oversized packaging.<br/>-<br/>+[[File:Are You Experienced - US cover-edit.jpg|thumb|''[[Are You Experienced]]'', [[Jimi Hendrix Experience]]]]<br/> The importance of cover design was such that some artists specialised or gained fame through their work, notably the design team [[Hipgnosis]] (through their work on [[Pink Floyd]] albums, amongst others) and [[Roger Dean (artist)|Roger Dean]] famous for his [[Yes (band)|Yes]] and [[Greenslade]] covers, [[Cal Schenkel]] for [[Captain Beefheart]]'s ''[[Trout Mask Replica]]'' and [[Frank Zappa]]'s ''[[We're Only in It for the Money]]''.<br/> <br/> The talents of many photographers and illustrators from both inside and outside of the music industry have been used to produce a vast array of memorable LP/CD covers. Photographer [[Mick Rock]] produced some of the most iconographic album covers of the 1970s, including [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s ''[[Queen II]]'' (recreated for their classic music video [[Bohemian Rhapsody]]), [[Syd Barrett]]'s ''[[The Madcap Laughs]]'', and [[Lou Reed]]'s ''[[Transformer (album)|Transformer]]''.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6613107.stm Photographer lives the Rock dream] BBC News. Retrieved May 26, 2011</ref> From 1972 to 1975, photographer [[Norman Seeff]] was Creative Director at [[United Artists]] and in addition to his many cover photographs ([[The Band]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]'s [[Hotter than Hell]], [[Joni Mitchell]]'s [[Hejira (album)|Hejira]] etc.), he art directed dozens of album covers including [[Exile on Main Street]], many of which received [[Grammy]] nominations.

In this animation, the red colour represents [[live steam]] entering the cylinder, blue represents expanded (spent) steam being exhausted from the cylinder. Note that the cylinder receives two steam injections during each full rotation; the same occurs in the cylinder on the other side of the engine.]]<!-- NOTE: The animated Gif cannot be re-sized, it will break the animation -->{{clr}}<br/> <br/> Exhaust steam is directed upwards to the atmosphere through the chimney, by way of a nozzle called a [[blastpipe]] that gives rise to the familiar "chuffing" sound of the steam locomotive. The blastpipe is placed at a strategic point inside the smokebox that is at the same time traversed by the combustion gases drawn through the boiler and grate by the action of the steam blast. The combining of the two streams, steam and exhaust gases, is crucial to the efficiency of any steam locomotive, and the internal profiles of the chimney (or, more strictly speaking, the ''ejector'') require careful design and adjustment. This has been the object of intensive studies by a number of engineers (and almost totally ignored by others with sometimes catastrophic effect). The fact that the draught depends on the exhaust pressure means that power delivery and power generation are automatically self-adjusting. Among other things, a balance has to be struck between obtaining sufficient draught for combustion whilst giving the exhaust gases and particles sufficient time to be consumed. In the past, fierce draught could lift the fire off the grate, or cause the ejection of unburnt particles of fuel, dirt and pollution for which steam locomotives had an unenviable reputation. Moreover, the pumping action of the exhaust has the counter effect of exerting ''back pressure'' on the side of the piston receiving steam, thus slightly reducing cylinder power. Designing the exhaust ejector has become a specific science in which [[André Chapelon|Chapelon]], [[Adolph Giesl-Gieslingen|Giesl]] and [[Livio Dante Porta|Porta]] were successive masters, and it was largely responsible for spectacular improvements in thermal efficiency and a significant reduction in maintenance time<ref name="A1" >See section of the [[LNER Class A1/A3]] article on the sharp increase in availability brought about in this respect by the application of the [[Kylchap]] exhaust to Gresley Pacifics in the early 1960s</ref> and pollution.<ref>J.J.G.
