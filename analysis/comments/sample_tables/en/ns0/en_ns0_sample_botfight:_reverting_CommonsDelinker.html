In this animation, the red colour represents [[live steam]] entering the cylinder, blue represents expanded (spent) steam being exhausted from the cylinder. Note that the cylinder receives two steam injections during each full rotation; the same occurs in the cylinder on the other side of the engine.]]<!-- NOTE: The animated Gif cannot be re-sized, it will break the animation -->{{clr}}<br/> <br/> Exhaust steam is directed upwards to the atmosphere through the chimney, by way of a nozzle called a [[blastpipe]] that gives rise to the familiar "chuffing" sound of the steam locomotive. The blastpipe is placed at a strategic point inside the smokebox that is at the same time traversed by the combustion gases drawn through the boiler and grate by the action of the steam blast. The combining of the two streams, steam and exhaust gases, is crucial to the efficiency of any steam locomotive, and the internal profiles of the chimney (or, more strictly speaking, the ''ejector'') require careful design and adjustment. This has been the object of intensive studies by a number of engineers (and almost totally ignored by others with sometimes catastrophic effect). The fact that the draught depends on the exhaust pressure means that power delivery and power generation are automatically self-adjusting. Among other things, a balance has to be struck between obtaining sufficient draught for combustion whilst giving the exhaust gases and particles sufficient time to be consumed. In the past, fierce draught could lift the fire off the grate, or cause the ejection of unburnt particles of fuel, dirt and pollution for which steam locomotives had an unenviable reputation. Moreover, the pumping action of the exhaust has the counter effect of exerting ''back pressure'' on the side of the piston receiving steam, thus slightly reducing cylinder power. Designing the exhaust ejector has become a specific science in which [[André Chapelon|Chapelon]], [[Adolph Giesl-Gieslingen|Giesl]] and [[Livio Dante Porta|Porta]] were successive masters, and it was largely responsible for spectacular improvements in thermal efficiency and a significant reduction in maintenance time<ref name="A1" >See section of the [[LNER Class A1/A3]] article on the sharp increase in availability brought about in this respect by the application of the [[Kylchap]] exhaust to Gresley Pacifics in the early 1960s</ref> and pollution.<ref>J.J.G.

Finally, the area above the reservoir section of the well is packed off inside the casing, and connected to the surface via a smaller diameter pipe called tubing. This arrangement provides a redundant barrier to leaks of hydrocarbons as well as allowing damaged sections to be replaced. Also, the smaller cross-sectional area of the tubing produces reservoir fluids at an increased velocity in order to minimize liquid fallback that would create additional back pressure, and shields the casing from corrosive well fluids.<br/> <br/>-<br/>+[[File:Labeled oil derrick.JPG|thumb|Labeled oil derrick]]<br/> <br/> In many wells, the natural pressure of the subsurface reservoir is high enough for the oil or gas to flow to the surface. However, this is not always the case, especially in depleted fields where the pressures have been lowered by other producing wells, or in low permeability oil reservoirs. Installing a smaller diameter tubing may be enough to help the production, but artificial lift methods may also be needed. Common solutions include downhole pumps, gas lift, or surface [[pumpjack|pump jacks]]. Many new systems in the last ten years have been introduced for well completion. Multiple [[Production packer|packer]] systems with frac ports or port collars in an all in one system have cut completion costs and improved production, especially in the case of horizontal wells.

Under the influence of designers like [[Bob Cato]] who at various stages in his long music career was vice president of creative services at both [[Columbia Records]] and [[United Artists]], album covers became renowned for being a marketing tool and an expression of artistic intent.

[[Gatefold|Gatefold cover]]s, (a folded double cover), and inserts, often with lyric sheets, made the album cover a desirable artifact in its own right. Notable examples are [[The Beatles]]' ''[[Sgt.

The move to the small (less than 1/4 the size of a record) CD format lost that impact, though attempts have been made to create a more desirable packaging for the CD format, for example the re-issue of ''Sgt.

In this animation, the red colour represents [[live steam]] entering the cylinder, blue represents expanded (spent) steam being exhausted from the cylinder. Note that the cylinder receives two steam injections during each full rotation; the same occurs in the cylinder on the other side of the engine.]]<!-- NOTE: The animated Gif cannot be re-sized, it will break the animation -->{{clr}}<br/> <br/> Exhaust steam is directed upwards to the atmosphere through the chimney, by way of a nozzle called a [[blastpipe]] that gives rise to the familiar "chuffing" sound of the steam locomotive. The blastpipe is placed at a strategic point inside the smokebox that is at the same time traversed by the combustion gases drawn through the boiler and grate by the action of the steam blast. The combining of the two streams, steam and exhaust gases, is crucial to the efficiency of any steam locomotive, and the internal profiles of the chimney (or, more strictly speaking, the ''ejector'') require careful design and adjustment. This has been the object of intensive studies by a number of engineers (and almost totally ignored by others with sometimes catastrophic effect). The fact that the draught depends on the exhaust pressure means that power delivery and power generation are automatically self-adjusting. Among other things, a balance has to be struck between obtaining sufficient draught for combustion whilst giving the exhaust gases and particles sufficient time to be consumed. In the past, fierce draught could lift the fire off the grate, or cause the ejection of unburnt particles of fuel, dirt and pollution for which steam locomotives had an unenviable reputation. Moreover, the pumping action of the exhaust has the counter effect of exerting ''back pressure'' on the side of the piston receiving steam, thus slightly reducing cylinder power. Designing the exhaust ejector has become a specific science in which [[André Chapelon|Chapelon]], [[Adolph Giesl-Gieslingen|Giesl]] and [[Livio Dante Porta|Porta]] were successive masters, and it was largely responsible for spectacular improvements in thermal efficiency and a significant reduction in maintenance time<ref name="A1" >See section of the [[LNER Class A1/A3]] article on the sharp increase in availability brought about in this respect by the application of the [[Kylchap]] exhaust to Gresley Pacifics in the early 1960s</ref> and pollution.<ref>J.J.G.

The Sedan was not equipped witha a rear hatch so access to the cargo area required removal of the front seats, the ease of which was advertised as a positive feature. The [[chassis]] was steel, with a [[fibreglass]] body enclosing a large but sparse interior. Windows were perspex except for the front windscreen which was laminated glass. The doors were steel with sliding perspex windows.<br/> <br/> The tyres for the Sedan and Utility were Michelin 125 R12 as stated in the specifications. The four speed dog clutch [[Villiers Engineering]] gearbox had no reverse so the engine had to be switched off and started backwards which provide four reverse gears. Fuel was delivered by gravity feed from a tank behind the dashboard. The fuel gauge was a plastic pipe running from the top to the bottom of the tank with a graduated glass tube section on the dashboard. As a [[Wheels (magazine)]] road test in 1974 put it "it read anywhere from full to empty depending on gradient, throttle and probably Greenwich mean time".</td>

Prior to Pearl Harbor, [[Henry H. Arnold|General Henry H. "Hap" Arnold]], commander of the USAAF, had turned down both Love's 1940 proposal and that of the better connected and more famous Cochran, despite the lobbying by [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]. But he essentially promised the command to Cochran, should such  a force be needed in the future.<br/> While the U.S. was not yet fighting in World War II, Cochran had gone to England to volunteer to fly for the [[Air Transport Auxiliary]] (ATA).<ref name=archives>[http://www.eisenhower.archives.gov/research/online_documents/jacqueline_cochran.html Jacqueline Cochran and the Women's Airforce Service Pilots (WASPs)]</ref> The ATA had been using female pilots since January 1940, and was starting to train new ones as well. The American women who flew in the ATA were the first American women to fly military aircraft.<ref name=archives/> They flew the Royal Air Force's front-line aircraft—[[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]], [[Hawker Typhoon|Typhoons]], [[Lockheed Hudson|Hudsons]], [[B-25 Mitchell|Mitchells]], [[Bristol Blenheim|Blenheims]], [[Airspeed Oxford|Oxfords]], [[Supermarine Walrus|Walruses]], and [[Supermarine Sea Otter|Sea Otters]]—in non-combat roles, but in combat-like conditions. Most of these women served in the ATA during the war. Only three members returned to the U.S. to participate in the WASP program.<br/>-<br/>+[[File:400-202xtra.jpg|left|thumb|Shirley Slade, WASP trainee—''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine feature story]]<br/> The U.S. was building its air power and military presence in anticipation of direct involvement in the conflict, and had belatedly begun to drastically expand its men in uniform. This period led to the dramatic increase in activity for the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]],  because of obvious gaps in "manpower" that could be filled by women. After the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], it became evident there were not enough male pilots.<br/> <br/> To those most involved within the new Ferrying Division of the [[Air Transport Command (United States Air Force)|Air Transport Command]] (ATC), the numbers were painfully obvious. Col. [[William H. Tunner]] was in charge of acquiring civilian ferry pilots. He decided to integrate a civilian force of female pilots into the AAF, after speaking with Major Robert M. Love, ATC staff officer, and his wife Nancy. Convinced of the feasibility of the program by Mrs. Love, who had a [[Commercial Pilot License]], he asked her to draw up a proposal, unaware that Arnold had shelved a similar proposal by Tunner's superior, Maj. Gen. [[Robert Olds]].</td>
