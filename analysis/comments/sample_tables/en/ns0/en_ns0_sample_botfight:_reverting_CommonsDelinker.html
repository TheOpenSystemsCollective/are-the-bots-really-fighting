On 9 July 1921, a truce was declared. On 11 October negotiations were opened under British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] and Arthur Griffith, who headed the Irish Republic's delegation.  The Irish Treaty delegation set up Headquarters in [[Hans Place]], Knightsbridge and on 5 December 1921 at 11:15 am it was decided by the delegation during private discussions at 22 Hans Place to recommend the Treaty to the Dáil Éireann; negotiations continued until 2:30 am on 6 December 1921 after which the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty|Treaty]] was signed by the parties.<br/> <br/>-<br/>+[[File:Michael Collins "Free State Demonstration" March 13, 1922.jpg|thumb|[[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] addressing a crowd in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] at a "Free State Demonstration" on 13 March 1922.]]<br/> That these negotiations would produce a form of Irish government short of the independence wished for by republicans was not in doubt. The United Kingdom could not offer a republican form of government without losing prestige and risking demands for something similar throughout the Empire. Furthermore, as one of the negotiators, [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], later admitted (and he was in a position to know, given his role in the independence war), the IRA at the time of the truce was weeks, if not days, from collapse, with a chronic shortage of ammunition. "Frankly, we thought they were mad", Collins said of the sudden British offer of a truce, although it was likely they would have continued in one form or another, given the level of public support. The [[President of the Irish Republic|President of the Republic]], Éamon de Valera, realising that a republic was not on offer, decided not to be a part of the treaty delegation and so be tainted by more militant republicans as a "sellout". Yet his own proposals published in January 1922 fell far short of an autonomous all-Ireland republic.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}<br/> <br/> As expected, the Anglo-Irish Treaty explicitly ruled out a republic.

However, it all but confirmed the [[partition of Ireland]] between [[Northern Ireland]] and the Irish Free State. It was ratified by the [[Second Dáil]], splitting Sinn Féin in the process.</td>

The addition of the cap occurs [[transcription (genetics)|co-transcriptionally]], after the growing [[RNA]] molecule contains as little as 25 [[nucleotide]]s.

Torrens was the last of six Australian [[River class destroyer]]s, the others (''Derwent'', ''Parramatta'', ''Stuart'', ''Swan'' and ''Yarra'') having been disposed of previously. Before the sinking ''Torrens'' had been thoroughly cleaned of all fuels, oils and potentially environmentally harmful substances. Her gun turret was donated to the South Western City of [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]]. ''Torrens'' was then towed from Fleet Base West (HMAS ''Stirling'') {{Convert|90|km|mi}} out to sea, west of [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]]. The submarine fired the torpedo at the stationary target from a submerged position over the horizon.<br/> <br/> The sinking of ''Torrens'' was a display of firepower that provided some much needed positive publicity for the ''Collins'' class submarines, plagued by numerous technical problems and criticised over troubles with the combat system and noise reduction. Ric Shalders, commander of the Submarine Squadron said "the requirement of new submarine trials, the new need to test war-stock and the availability of the Torrens all came together to produce a very satisfactory result".<ref>{{cite web</td>

Navies conduct live fire exercises to test elements of an integrated defense system such as the US [[Aegis combat system|Aegis]]; namely its ability to track and destroy enemy [[anti-ship missile]]s. Tests can also include an integrated defense system’s compatibility to fire new missiles or newer versions of the same missile. Live fire tests are also conducted with a [[CIWS]] system, which is designed as the last line of defense for a ship. Surface ships also frequently testfire the various guns kept and maintained aboard the vessel, these can range from side arms and rifles up to the [[16"/50 caliber Mark 7 gun|16" guns]] of the mothballed US [[Iowa class battleship|''Iowa''-class battleships]]. This is done to maintain the skill and knowledge needed to operate the weapon. In the case of [[aircraft carrier]]s, the pilots assigned to the carrier may conduct air-to-air and air-to-surface missile exercises similar to those of the air force; additionally, these pilots may also conduct live fire exercises against derelict ships.

The best known tests of torpedoes are those conducted against a derelict ship, typically on ships from a Navy's own [[reserve fleet|mothball fleet]] that has become too old or obsolete to warrant maintaining. The purpose of these tests is to ensure that the torpedo will work under combat conditions, and such tests can be used to determine whether or not [[noisemaker]]s or other [[decoy]]s will have any effect against the unit when launched.<br/> <br/> ===Use against training soldiers===</td>

He received a modern education, becoming a noted poet and scholar in his own right. He took a deep interest in military, political and diplomatic affairs, and spent much of his time on improving the administration. Dying without a surviving male heir in 1943, his successor was his younger brother, Muzaffar-ul-Mulk. Also a man with a military disposition, his reign witnessed the tumultuous events surrounding the transfer of power in 1947. His prompt action in sending in his own Body Guard to Gilgit was instrumental in securing the territory for Pakistan.<br/> <br/> The unexpected early death of Muzaffar-ul-Mulk saw the succession pass to his relatively inexperienced eldest son, Saif-ur-Rahman, in 1948. Due to certain tensions he was exiled from Chitral by the Government of Pakistan for six years. They appointed a board of administration composed of Chitrali and Pakistani officials to govern the state in his absence. He died in a plane crash while returning to resume charge of Chitral in 1954.</td>
