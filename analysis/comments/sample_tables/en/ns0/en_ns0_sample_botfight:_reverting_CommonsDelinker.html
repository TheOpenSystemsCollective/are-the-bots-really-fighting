As a fact was that Convention held?") <br><br>MR. MULCAHY:...(h) It was proposed to submit the proposed Constitution to a specially summoned Convention of the Irish Volunteers. That Convention was not held because no single member of the Volunteer Executive of the time would recommend the holding of that Convention in the circumstances that then existed in Dublin. Delegates for this Convention were actually selected but the Convention was not held. Ballot papers were circulated to the delegates and a vote was taken as far as the question of the Oath was concerned. As far as this question was concerned, the amendment to the constitution was accepted.</ref>  The anti-Treaty IRA formed their own "Army Executive", which they declared to be the real government of the country, despite the result of the [[Irish elections, 1921|1921 general election]].

A small detachment of 14 men, led by [[Second Lieutenant]] Brian Barrett-Hamilton, was then stationed on attachment to the British Army in [[Bahrain]] in June 1961, and remained there for two months. The [[Congo Crisis]] led to the Battalion's first full mobilisation on 9 September 1961, when it was detailed to man the border between [[Northern Rhodesia]] and Katanga. The companies were deployed separately in the border towns of [[Chingola]], [[Kitwe]], [[Chililabombwe|Bancroft]] and [[Mufulira]], and proceeded to run checkpoints and assist refugees who crossed the border. While there were many coming over from Katanga during that time, the garrison at Chingola was surprised to meet Tshombe himself on 13 September as he fled into Northern Rhodesia.<ref name="binda2223">{{Harvnb<br/> |Binda<br/> |2008</td>

Conspicuous white [[rhizomorph]]s extend from the base of this structure and help to anchor it in the soil. The outer tissue layer, or [[peridium]], is white to pale, smooth, firm-membranous. The slimy [[spore]] mass, or [[gleba]], is attached to outer surface of the [[pileus (mycology)|cap]], and is colored dark olivaceous to blackish brown. The [[stipe (mycology)|stalks]] of ''Phallus'' mushrooms are called ''receptacles'': they are upright, cylindrical, hollow, spongy, and bearing roughly bell-shaped cap with irregularly branching ridges on the outer surface. Some species have an ''indusium'', a net-like structure that extends from the cap to the ground.<ref name=Pegler1995/> The gleba is slimy and pale greenish-yellow; in several species the gleba has a foul, [[carrion]]-like odor, which attracts insects that then help disperse the spores.

This period led to the dramatic increase in activity for the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]],  because of obvious gaps in "manpower" that could be filled by women. After the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], it became evident there were not enough male pilots.<br/> <br/> To those most involved within the new Ferrying Division of the [[Air Transport Command (United States Air Force)|Air Transport Command]] (ATC), the numbers were painfully obvious. Col. [[William H. Tunner]] was in charge of acquiring civilian ferry pilots. He decided to integrate a civilian force of female pilots into the AAF, after speaking with Major Robert M. Love, ATC staff officer, and his wife Nancy. Convinced of the feasibility of the program by Mrs. Love, who had a [[Commercial Pilot License]], he asked her to draw up a proposal, unaware that Arnold had shelved a similar proposal by Tunner's superior, Maj. Gen. [[Robert Olds]].</td>

The base to the top width ratio of 1 to 8 (between basement and the summit) has a marble covering on the exterior with austere decoration. The faces of the facade have carved ornamentation with different materials. There are stitches of [[roudani tracetine]] on a 100,000 MP surface. This decorative material (with chrome and green as dominant colours), is a substitute for the use of bricks, the material used in many other notable minarets, and has given the mosque an extraordinary elegance.{{sfn|Usa|2006|p=68}} Green tiles decorate the minaret for one third of the height from the top, and then changes colour to deep green or [[turquoise blue]]; it is said that in the Hassan II minaret, the designer had used his sea-foam green and God’s blue to celebrate the life of a king.<ref name="Morgan 2005"/> The concrete used for the minaret was a special high-grade type, which could perform well under severe conditions of a combined action of strong wind and seismicity. This was achieved by the Science Department of the [[Bouygues ]]Group, the contractors for the project, who developed an extra-strength concrete four times stronger than ordinary concrete. Called B.H.P (highly resistant concrete), it offers a resistance to compression value of 1200 bars per sqcm (claimed to be a world record) and has a very quick setting time.<ref name=Moly/> This enabled the building of a taller structure with due underpinning of the foundation, while adhering to the construction schedule. Cranes were also designed to suit the height of the minaret for concreting.{{-}}<br/> <br/> ==Restoration works==</td>

Samuelson experimented with different positions on the skis for several days until 2 July 1922. Samuelson discovered that leaning backwards in the water with ski tips up and poking out of the water at the tip was the optimal method. His brother Ben towed him and they reached a speed of {{convert|20|mph|km/h}}.<ref name=ABC-history/> Samuelson also achieved the first ski jump on 8 July 1925 using a greased {{convert|4|by|16|ft|m}} ramp. Samuelson spent 15 years performing shows and teaching water skiing to people in the United States. Experimenting further with the sport, Samuelson hooked up a line behind a [[World War 2]] flying boat with 200 horsepower and reached a speed of 80 miles per hour, making him the first speed skier.<br/> <br/> Samuelson went through several iterations of equipment in his quest to ski on water. His first equipment consisted of barrel staves for skis.<ref name=ABC-history>{{cite web|title=History of Water Skiing|url=http://www.abc-of-skiing.com/water-skiing/history.asp|work=ABC of Skiing|publisher=MaxLifestyle International Inc.}}</ref> He later tried [[Ski|snow skis]],<ref name=ABC-history/> but finally fabricated his own design out of lumber with bindings made of strips of leather. The ski rope was made from a long [[Sash window|window sash]].<ref name=ABC-history/> Samuelson never patented any of his ski equipment. The first patent for water skis was issued to Fred Waller, of Huntington, NY, on 27 October 1925, for skis he developed independently and marketed as "Dolphin Akwa-Skees." Waller's skis were constructed of kiln-dried mahogany, as were some boats at that time. Jack Andresen patented the first trick ski, a shorter, fin-less water ski, in 1940.</td>
