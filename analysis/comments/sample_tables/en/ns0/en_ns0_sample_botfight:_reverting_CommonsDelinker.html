On 9 July 1921, a truce was declared. On 11 October negotiations were opened under British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] and Arthur Griffith, who headed the Irish Republic's delegation.  The Irish Treaty delegation set up Headquarters in [[Hans Place]], Knightsbridge and on 5 December 1921 at 11:15 am it was decided by the delegation during private discussions at 22 Hans Place to recommend the Treaty to the Dáil Éireann; negotiations continued until 2:30 am on 6 December 1921 after which the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty|Treaty]] was signed by the parties.<br/> <br/>-<br/>+[[File:Michael Collins "Free State Demonstration" March 13, 1922.jpg|thumb|[[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] addressing a crowd in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] at a "Free State Demonstration" on 13 March 1922.]]<br/> That these negotiations would produce a form of Irish government short of the independence wished for by republicans was not in doubt. The United Kingdom could not offer a republican form of government without losing prestige and risking demands for something similar throughout the Empire. Furthermore, as one of the negotiators, [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], later admitted (and he was in a position to know, given his role in the independence war), the IRA at the time of the truce was weeks, if not days, from collapse, with a chronic shortage of ammunition. "Frankly, we thought they were mad", Collins said of the sudden British offer of a truce, although it was likely they would have continued in one form or another, given the level of public support. The [[President of the Irish Republic|President of the Republic]], Éamon de Valera, realising that a republic was not on offer, decided not to be a part of the treaty delegation and so be tainted by more militant republicans as a "sellout". Yet his own proposals published in January 1922 fell far short of an autonomous all-Ireland republic.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}<br/> <br/> As expected, the Anglo-Irish Treaty explicitly ruled out a republic. What it offered was [[dominion]] status, as a state of the British Commonwealth, equal to Canada, Newfoundland, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. Though less than expected by the Sinn Féin leadership, it was substantially more than the initial form of home rule within the United Kingdom sought by [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] from 1880, and a serious advancement on the Home Rule Act of 1914 that the Irish nationalist leader [[John Redmond]] had achieved through parliamentary proceedings. However, it all but confirmed the [[partition of Ireland]] between [[Northern Ireland]] and the Irish Free State. It was ratified by the [[Second Dáil]], splitting Sinn Féin in the process.</td>

This period led to the dramatic increase in activity for the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]],  because of obvious gaps in "manpower" that could be filled by women. After the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], it became evident there were not enough male pilots.<br/> <br/> To those most involved within the new Ferrying Division of the [[Air Transport Command (United States Air Force)|Air Transport Command]] (ATC), the numbers were painfully obvious. Col. [[William H. Tunner]] was in charge of acquiring civilian ferry pilots. He decided to integrate a civilian force of female pilots into the AAF, after speaking with Major Robert M. Love, ATC staff officer, and his wife Nancy. Convinced of the feasibility of the program by Mrs. Love, who had a [[Commercial Pilot License]], he asked her to draw up a proposal, unaware that Arnold had shelved a similar proposal by Tunner's superior, Maj. Gen. [[Robert Olds]].</td>

Navies conduct live fire exercises to test elements of an integrated defense system such as the US [[Aegis combat system|Aegis]]; namely its ability to track and destroy enemy [[anti-ship missile]]s. Tests can also include an integrated defense system’s compatibility to fire new missiles or newer versions of the same missile. Live fire tests are also conducted with a [[CIWS]] system, which is designed as the last line of defense for a ship.

This is done to maintain the skill and knowledge needed to operate the weapon. In the case of [[aircraft carrier]]s, the pilots assigned to the carrier may conduct air-to-air and air-to-surface missile exercises similar to those of the air force; additionally, these pilots may also conduct live fire exercises against derelict ships.

The best known tests of torpedoes are those conducted against a derelict ship, typically on ships from a Navy's own [[reserve fleet|mothball fleet]] that has become too old or obsolete to warrant maintaining. The purpose of these tests is to ensure that the torpedo will work under combat conditions, and such tests can be used to determine whether or not [[noisemaker]]s or other [[decoy]]s will have any effect against the unit when launched.<br/> <br/> ===Use against training soldiers===</td>
