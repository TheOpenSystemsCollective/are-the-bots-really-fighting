The album's A-side was recorded in concert Klaukkala, such as the B-side of the first paragraph, but the rest was recorded in the studio. This album was the band's record label, Love Records, the first gold record.<br/> <br/> ==Roadrunner (1974)==<br/>-<br/>+[[File:Roadrunnerhurriganes.jpg|thumb]]<br/> Hurriganes' commercial high point was released in 1974: [[Roadrunner (Hurriganes album)|Roadrunner]], an album that included the band's more traditional song "Get On", which won the International European Pop Jury competition. Also the songs "Roadrunner," "It Ain't What You Do," "I Will Stay" and "The Phone Rang" were classics. ''Roadrunner'' was recorded in Stockholm at Marcus Music Studios, and the album was also pressed in Stockholm. ''Roadrunner'' can be considered as one of the major Finnish rock albums, and it was Finland's best-selling album by a Finnish band in from 1974 until 1985, when the [[Dingo (band)|Dingos]]' ''Kerjäläisten valtakunta'' exceeded the volume of sales. Also the album cover art (by Risto Vuorimies) has become a classic: it was the only Finnish album cover in 1977's Hipgnosisin and Roger Dean's work Album Cover Album (Dragons, World Book). The ''Roadrunner'' cover was designed by Kari Korhonen, who also made a [[Donald Duck]] ("Rokkikukot") comic book version of the album cover. ''Roadrunner'' is still considered one of Finnish rock music's most important albums, and it is Finland's seventh-best-selling album of all time. The cover's stylish motif was chosen by Hurriganes' bassist Cisse Häkkinen, who owned a light blue 1954 Cadillac Series 62 sedan. The cover shows the Hurriganes' Remu Aaltonen, Cisse Häkkinen and Albert Järvinen posing elegantly in suits sitting on the back seat of the Cadillac. The car ended up in the ownership of Kari Niiranen, or "DJ Nite," a highly popular disc jockey who also toured with Hurriganes. ''Roadrunner'' is regarded as one of the best Finnish rock records ever released, and in 2007, it was re-released as a SACD mixed to a 5.1 format.<br/> <br/> ==Crazy Days: Kallio returns (1975)==</td>

Under the influence of designers like [[Bob Cato]] who at various stages in his long music career was vice president of creative services at both [[Columbia Records]] and [[United Artists]], album covers became renowned for being a marketing tool and an expression of artistic intent. [[The Band]]'s 1970 release ''[[Stage Fright (album)|Stage Fright]]'' with [[Norman Seeff]]'s photograph as a poster insert is an early example with the poster quickly becoming a collector's item. [[Gatefold|Gatefold cover]]s, (a folded double cover), and inserts, often with lyric sheets, made the album cover a desirable artifact in its own right. Notable examples are [[The Beatles]]' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' which had cut-out inserts, lyrics, a gatefold sleeve even though it was a single album, [[The Rolling Stones]]' ''[[Exile on Main Street]]'' which had a gatefold and a series of 12 perforated postcards as inserts (also by photographer [[Norman Seeff]]), and [[Pink Floyd]]'s ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' which had a gatefold, lyrics, no title on the sleeve and poster and sticker inserts. The move to the small (less than 1/4 the size of a record) CD format lost that impact, though attempts have been made to create a more desirable packaging for the CD format, for example the re-issue of ''Sgt. Pepper'', which had a cardboard box and booklet, or the use of oversized packaging.<br/>-<br/>+[[File:Are You Experienced - US cover-edit.jpg|thumb|''[[Are You Experienced]]'', [[Jimi Hendrix Experience]]]]<br/> The importance of cover design was such that some artists specialised or gained fame through their work, notably the design team [[Hipgnosis]] (through their work on [[Pink Floyd]] albums, amongst others) and [[Roger Dean (artist)|Roger Dean]] famous for his [[Yes (band)|Yes]] and [[Greenslade]] covers, [[Cal Schenkel]] for [[Captain Beefheart]]'s ''[[Trout Mask Replica]]'' and [[Frank Zappa]]'s ''[[We're Only in It for the Money]]''.<br/> <br/> The talents of many photographers and illustrators from both inside and outside of the music industry have been used to produce a vast array of memorable LP/CD covers. Photographer [[Mick Rock]] produced some of the most iconographic album covers of the 1970s, including [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s ''[[Queen II]]'' (recreated for their classic music video [[Bohemian Rhapsody]]), [[Syd Barrett]]'s ''[[The Madcap Laughs]]'', and [[Lou Reed]]'s ''[[Transformer (album)|Transformer]]''.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6613107.stm Photographer lives the Rock dream] BBC News.

Likewise, the defence of this position the previous evening had prevented a Chinese assault on the western flank of Hill 504. As such at 09:30 the order to withdraw was rescinded and B Company were tasked to re-occupy the position.

The faces of the facade have carved ornamentation with different materials. There are stitches of [[roudani tracetine]] on a 100,000 MP surface. This decorative material (with chrome and green as dominant colours), is a substitute for the use of bricks, the material used in many other notable minarets, and has given the mosque an extraordinary elegance.{{sfn|Usa|2006|p=68}} Green tiles decorate the minaret for one third of the height from the top, and then changes colour to deep green or [[turquoise blue]]; it is said that in the Hassan II minaret, the designer had used his sea-foam green and God’s blue to celebrate the life of a king.<ref name="Morgan 2005"/> The concrete used for the minaret was a special high-grade type, which could perform well under severe conditions of a combined action of strong wind and seismicity. This was achieved by the Science Department of the [[Bouygues ]]Group, the contractors for the project, who developed an extra-strength concrete four times stronger than ordinary concrete. Called B.H.P (highly resistant concrete), it offers a resistance to compression value of 1200 bars per sqcm (claimed to be a world record) and has a very quick setting time.<ref name=Moly/> This enabled the building of a taller structure with due underpinning of the foundation, while adhering to the construction schedule. Cranes were also designed to suit the height of the minaret for concreting.{{-}}<br/> <br/> ==Restoration works==</td>

He was instrumental in putting forward a child care strategy during the Martin government. Dryden, who has written a book about the public education system, stressed the importance of improving the education system in order to keep Canada competitive. "Learning is at the core of our future—for a person, a society, an economy, a country," Dryden said. "Learning is our only real security, our only real opportunity, and this program, years in the hoping, was the first big step towards truly lifelong learning."

The new Breeze Card allows riders to load money on the card for use over time, and to add weekly/monthly passes that are not fixed to a calendar period. The Breeze Card ($1) is for every passenger riding MARTA. The new Breeze fare gates are designed to help prevent [[Turnstile#Turnstile jumping|fare evasion]]; with the older fare collection system fare evasion was much easier and was estimated to cost MARTA $10&nbsp;million per year.<ref>{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Donsky |title=MARTA Plugs Gap in New Station Gates|work=Atlanta Journal-Constitution  |page=4B |date=February 22, 2006}}</ref> Other connecting transit systems such as [[Georgia Regional Transportation Authority|GRTA Xpress]], [[Cobb Community Transit|CCT]] have adopted the [[infrastructure]], and are currently building implementation plans.<br/></td>

He received a modern education, becoming a noted poet and scholar in his own right. He took a deep interest in military, political and diplomatic affairs, and spent much of his time on improving the administration. Dying without a surviving male heir in 1943, his successor was his younger brother, Muzaffar-ul-Mulk. Also a man with a military disposition, his reign witnessed the tumultuous events surrounding the transfer of power in 1947. His prompt action in sending in his own Body Guard to Gilgit was instrumental in securing the territory for Pakistan.<br/> <br/> The unexpected early death of Muzaffar-ul-Mulk saw the succession pass to his relatively inexperienced eldest son, Saif-ur-Rahman, in 1948. Due to certain tensions he was exiled from Chitral by the Government of Pakistan for six years. They appointed a board of administration composed of Chitrali and Pakistani officials to govern the state in his absence. He died in a plane crash while returning to resume charge of Chitral in 1954.</td>

He was instrumental in putting forward a child care strategy during the Martin government. Dryden, who has written a book about the public education system, stressed the importance of improving the education system in order to keep Canada competitive. "Learning is at the core of our future—for a person, a society, an economy, a country," Dryden said. "Learning is our only real security, our only real opportunity, and this program, years in the hoping, was the first big step towards truly lifelong learning." He also said Canada's unique, multi-ethnic mix needs to be held up as an example to the world.<br/> :'''Supporters in caucus prior to first ballot: 12'''</td>

In this animation, the red colour represents [[live steam]] entering the cylinder, blue represents expanded (spent) steam being exhausted from the cylinder. Note that the cylinder receives two steam injections during each full rotation; the same occurs in the cylinder on the other side of the engine.]]<!-- NOTE: The animated Gif cannot be re-sized, it will break the animation -->{{clr}}<br/> <br/> Exhaust steam is directed upwards to the atmosphere through the chimney, by way of a nozzle called a [[blastpipe]] that gives rise to the familiar "chuffing" sound of the steam locomotive. The blastpipe is placed at a strategic point inside the smokebox that is at the same time traversed by the combustion gases drawn through the boiler and grate by the action of the steam blast. The combining of the two streams, steam and exhaust gases, is crucial to the efficiency of any steam locomotive, and the internal profiles of the chimney (or, more strictly speaking, the ''ejector'') require careful design and adjustment. This has been the object of intensive studies by a number of engineers (and almost totally ignored by others with sometimes catastrophic effect). The fact that the draught depends on the exhaust pressure means that power delivery and power generation are automatically self-adjusting. Among other things, a balance has to be struck between obtaining sufficient draught for combustion whilst giving the exhaust gases and particles sufficient time to be consumed. In the past, fierce draught could lift the fire off the grate, or cause the ejection of unburnt particles of fuel, dirt and pollution for which steam locomotives had an unenviable reputation. Moreover, the pumping action of the exhaust has the counter effect of exerting ''back pressure'' on the side of the piston receiving steam, thus slightly reducing cylinder power. Designing the exhaust ejector has become a specific science in which [[André Chapelon|Chapelon]], [[Adolph Giesl-Gieslingen|Giesl]] and [[Livio Dante Porta|Porta]] were successive masters, and it was largely responsible for spectacular improvements in thermal efficiency and a significant reduction in maintenance time<ref name="A1" >See section of the [[LNER Class A1/A3]] article on the sharp increase in availability brought about in this respect by the application of the [[Kylchap]] exhaust to Gresley Pacifics in the early 1960s</ref> and pollution.<ref>J.J.G.

Samuelson experimented with different positions on the skis for several days until 2 July 1922.

"Frankly, we thought they were mad", Collins said of the sudden British offer of a truce, although it was likely they would have continued in one form or another, given the level of public support. The [[President of the Irish Republic|President of the Republic]], Éamon de Valera, realising that a republic was not on offer, decided not to be a part of the treaty delegation and so be tainted by more militant republicans as a "sellout". Yet his own proposals published in January 1922 fell far short of an autonomous all-Ireland republic.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}<br/> <br/> As expected, the Anglo-Irish Treaty explicitly ruled out a republic. What it offered was [[dominion]] status, as a state of the British Commonwealth, equal to Canada, Newfoundland, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. Though less than expected by the Sinn Féin leadership, it was substantially more than the initial form of home rule within the United Kingdom sought by [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] from 1880, and a serious advancement on the Home Rule Act of 1914 that the Irish nationalist leader [[John Redmond]] had achieved through parliamentary proceedings. However, it all but confirmed the [[partition of Ireland]] between [[Northern Ireland]] and the Irish Free State. It was ratified by the [[Second Dáil]], splitting Sinn Féin in the process.</td>

His treatment divides the genus into five [[subgenus (biology)|subgenera]]: ''Aporophallus''; ''Itajahya''; ''Endophallus''; ''Satyrus''; and ''Phallus''.<ref name=Kreisel1996/> Spanish mycologist [[Francisco D.

Conspicuous white [[rhizomorph]]s extend from the base of this structure and help to anchor it in the soil. The outer tissue layer, or [[peridium]], is white to pale, smooth, firm-membranous. The slimy [[spore]] mass, or [[gleba]], is attached to outer surface of the [[pileus (mycology)|cap]], and is colored dark olivaceous to blackish brown. The [[stipe (mycology)|stalks]] of ''Phallus'' mushrooms are called ''receptacles'': they are upright, cylindrical, hollow, spongy, and bearing roughly bell-shaped cap with irregularly branching ridges on the outer surface. Some species have an ''indusium'', a net-like structure that extends from the cap to the ground.<ref name=Pegler1995/> The gleba is slimy and pale greenish-yellow; in several species the gleba has a foul, [[carrion]]-like odor, which attracts insects that then help disperse the spores. [[Mosquito]]es, however, that feed on the gleba are killed, suggesting the fungus may contain compounds that could be used as an attractant or [[biocontrol]] agent.<ref name=Gardezi1992/><br/> <br/> The spores of ''Phallus'' species are small, [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]], and somewhat translucent ([[hyaline]]).<ref name=Pegler1995/> The spores of various Phallaceae species, including ''P.&nbsp;ravenelii'' has been shown to be smooth and featureless using [[scanning electron microscopy]]. Roughened spore surfaces are considered by some mycologists to be an adaptation that results in friction during travel in the air, and increase dispersal distances. ''Phallus'' spores are not airborne at any time in their life cycle.<ref name=Burk1982/></td>
