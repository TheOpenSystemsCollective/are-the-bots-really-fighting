Information is now a commodity that can be bought and sold, or used as a form of entertainment, or worn like a garment to enhance one's status. It comes indiscriminately, directed at no one in particular, disconnected from usefulness; we are glutted with information, drowning in information, have no control over it, don't know what to do with it."</td>

The more concentrated solution will have a tendency to diffuse into the comparatively less concentrated one. The rate of diffusion of each [[ion]] will be roughly proportional to its speed in an electric field. If [[anion]] diffuses more rapidly than the [[cation]], it will diffuse ahead into the dilute solution leaving the later negatively [[Electric charge|charged]] and the concentrated solution positively charged. So an electrical double layer of positive and negative charges will be produced at the junction of the two solutions. So at the point of junction, a [[Voltage|difference of potential]] will develop because of the ionic transfer. This potential is called liquid junction potential or diffusion potential.  The magnitude of the potential depends on the relative speeds of the ions. <br/> \t<br/> ==Calculation==</td>

It covers the financial details of life, auto, health and fire [[insurance]] -- the types consumers normally buy.  Because insurers are always the subject of [[fraudster]]s who say torch their own unprofitable businesses to collect on the insurance, who say murder the insured to collect on the death benefit, who falsify their own deaths, insurance companies need to be on their guard.  In addition, an unscrupulous insurer could in theory make more profits if it could either induce their insureds into settling for less than they are entitled to or from outright wrongly denying valid clams in hopes that a small yet significant percentage would either get discouraged or wrongly believe that their claims were wrong.  This makes dealings with insurers difficult.  This book was the first guide to ordinary consumers into both the math and the business side of insurance.<br/></td>

It is useful for getting an exact quantity of [[water vapor]] in the air from a [[relative humidity]] (RH). Given an RH percentage, the density of water in the air is given by RH * SVD = Actual Vapor Density. Alternatively, RH can be found by RH = Actual Vapor Density / SVD. As Relative Humidity is a percent, vapor density can be in whatever units are necessary, usually grams or kilograms per cubic meter. <!-- See discussion page --><br/> <br/> For low temperatures (below 400 [[kelvin]]s or so), SVD can be approximated from the SVP by the [[ideal gas law]]: ''PV'' =  ''nRT'' where ''n'' is the number of [[Mole (unit)|moles]], which is related by density by ''n'' = ''M/m'', where ''M'' is the mass of water present and ''m'' is the molar mass of water (18.01528 grams/mole).

He was the chairman of Erode [[Municipality]] and undertook constructive programs spreading the use of [[Khadi]], picketing toddy shops, boycotting shops selling foreign cloth, and eradicating [[Dalit|untouchability]]. In 1921, Periyar was imprisioned for picketing toddy shops in Erode. When his wife as well as his sister joined the agitation, it gained momentum, and the administration was forced to come to a compromise.

As a fielder in this instance typically cannot respond to the path of the ball quickly enough, players try to avoid encounters with in-between hops. While ground balls and throws in the dirt usually do not change direction, such factors as the spin of the baseball or imperfections of the playing surface can influence a bounce. An in-between hop contrasts with a ''short hop'', which refers to a baseball that reaches an infielder immediately after it bounces.<br/> <br/> The in-between hop is often responsible for errors in [[Infielder|infield]] play.
