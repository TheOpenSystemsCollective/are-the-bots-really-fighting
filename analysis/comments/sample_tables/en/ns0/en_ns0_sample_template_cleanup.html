It was written by financial journalist [[Andrew Tobias]] who became famous for his earlier book ''[[The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need]]''.  It covers the financial details of life, auto, health and fire [[insurance]] -- the types consumers normally buy.  Because insurers are always the subject of [[fraudster]]s who say torch their own unprofitable businesses to collect on the insurance, who say murder the insured to collect on the death benefit, who falsify their own deaths, insurance companies need to be on their guard.  In addition, an unscrupulous insurer could in theory make more profits if it could either induce their insureds into settling for less than they are entitled to or from outright wrongly denying valid clams in hopes that a small yet significant percentage would either get discouraged or wrongly believe that their claims were wrong.  This makes dealings with insurers difficult.  This book was the first guide to ordinary consumers into both the math and the business side of insurance.<br/></td>
