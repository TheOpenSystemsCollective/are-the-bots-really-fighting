Hurst bought the A-House. Cabral, who worked as manager, soon took over full ownership and made the long discreetly gay friendly establishment openly so.

The dancefloor may have been added by Cabral in the 1950s or maybe earlier. I've no clue when the upstairs Macho Bar was added nor when they started using the bit across the street that is now the restaurant.  All I know is that the 5 parts nentioned were in place since the late 1980s.--> the property has consisted of five parts.  There is the original tavern, now known as the Little Bar, an intimate space with a [[fireplace]] and [[jukebox]].  Upstairs from it is the Macho Bar, a space primarily for [[Leather subculture|leather men]] and decorated accordingly with [[International Mister Leather|IML]] posters, [[Tom of Finland]] images, etc.  In the larger wing, the ground level is a [[nightclub]] with dancefloor.  The area upstairs from this, once hotel rooms, has mostly been (and is currently) used only for storage.  A small building directly across Masonic Way (the short, [[Car-free zone|pedestrian way]] on Commercial Street where the A-House is located) was long-used as a storage space but is now a restaurant called Grand Central.  In the 1990s a sixth area was added, an enclosed exterior area in back and to the right of the large building which greatly expanded the nightclub's capacity.<ref name="ah"/><ref> [[Advertisement]]s from this place say "Provincetown's premier nightclub for over 25 years", hinting that the bottom floor of what was the hotel may have been converted into a dancefloor as late as the end of the 1970s.</ref><br/></td>

His talent from the first revealed itself as strictly academical, full of elegance and grace, but somewhat lacking originality. In the course of his residence in [[Italy]] Baudry derived strong inspiration from Italian art with the mannerism of [[Correggio]], as was very evident in the two works he exhibited in the [[Paris Salon|Salon]] of [[1857]], which were purchased for the Luxembourg: ''The Martyrdom of a Vestal Virgin and The Child''. His ''Leda'', ''St John the Baptist'', and a ''Portrait of Beul'', exhibited at the same time, took a first prize that year. Throughout this early period Baudry commonly selected mythological or fanciful subjects, one of the most noteworthy being ''The Pearl and the Wave'' (1862). Once only did he attempt an historical picture, ''Charlotte Corday after the murder of Marat'' ([[1861]]); and returned by preference to the former class of subjects or to painting portraits of illustrious men of his day: [[Guizot]], [[Charles Garnier]], [[Edmond About]].</td>

The 16V came with the 1.4 16V 100&nbsp;PS (74&nbsp;kW) engine and had options such as 15" Spa alloys and air conditioning.  However more interest was in the GTI.  Available only in hatchback form, the GTI was powered by a 1.6 16V 125&nbsp;PS (92&nbsp;kW) engine with variable valve timing, making it the most powerful Polo to come out the factory to date. External changes gave the car the looks to match its power.  Deeper front bumpers with honeycomb mesh inserts, side skirts, fog lights, a honeycomb mesh grill and 15" BBS split rims suited the car well.  There were also standard extras such as "Climatronic" fully automatic air conditioning, Xenon headlights (with a headlight washer system), a 6 disc CD autochanger, exclusive sports interior with leather steering wheel and gearstick, chrome inserts and driver aids such as ABS with EBD and an EDL (a system to aid traction).

A small building directly across Masonic Way (the short, [[Car-free zone|pedestrian way]] on Commercial Street where the A-House is located) was long-used as a storage space but is now a restaurant called Grand Central.

The Okwanuchu occupied territory south, southwest, and southeast of [[Mount Shasta|Mount Shasta]], California, [[United States|USA]], including the present-day cities of [[Mount Shasta, California]], [[McCloud, California]] and [[Dunsmuir, California]], the upper [[Sacramento River]] downstream to North Salt Creek, the Squaw Valley Creek drainage, and the upper [[McCloud River]] downstream to where it meets Squaw Valley Creek. <br/> <br/> The Okwanuchu were speakers of the older [[Hokan]]-speaking family of languages, with archaeological sites associated with their range dating back in excess of 5000 years.  Members of the [[Penutian]]-speaking family of languages, especially the [[Wintu]], arrived in central Northern California in the vicinity of [[Redding, California]] about 1200 years ago, likely from southern Oregon.  The Wintu possessed superior technology, were out-competing their Hokan-language family neighbors, and were expanding Wintu territory at the expense of the Okwanuchu and the [[Achomawi]] to the north, and the [[Yana people|Yana]] to the east.  It appears likely that even if Europeans and Americans not intervened (beginning in the 1820s), the Wintu would have absorbed or otherwise eliminated the Okwanuchu over the course of the coming centuries.<br/> <br/>-Anthropologist [[Alfred L.

In the course of his residence in [[Italy]] Baudry derived strong inspiration from Italian art with the mannerism of [[Correggio]], as was very evident in the two works he exhibited in the [[Paris Salon|Salon]] of [[1857]], which were purchased for the Luxembourg: ''The Martyrdom of a Vestal Virgin and The Child''. His ''Leda'', ''St John the Baptist'', and a ''Portrait of Beul'', exhibited at the same time, took a first prize that year. Throughout this early period Baudry commonly selected mythological or fanciful subjects, one of the most noteworthy being ''The Pearl and the Wave'' (1862). Once only did he attempt an historical picture, ''Charlotte Corday after the murder of Marat'' ([[1861]]); and returned by preference to the former class of subjects or to painting portraits of illustrious men of his day: [[Guizot]], [[Charles Garnier]], [[Edmond About]].</td>

In December he was put on trial and although the charges of treason were dropped, he was judged guilty of felony and hurriedly put to death on [[22 January]] [[1552]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Loades|2004|pp=109–111}}. According to Loades, a felony, a lesser crime than treason in English law, included gathering men unlawfully and plotting the death of a councillor.

It was aggravated during the year by the gradual appropriation of ecclesiastical property by the regency.<ref name="MacCulloch520">{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|p=520}}</ref> However, even throughout this political turmoil, Cranmer worked simultaneously on three major projects in his reform programme: the revision of [[canon law]], the revision of the Prayer Book, and the formation of a statement of doctrine.<ref>{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=493–500}}</ref><br/> <br/>-<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:VermigliAsper2.JPG|thumb|left|[[Pietro Martire Vermigli]] or Peter Martyr greatly assisted Cranmer in the English Reformation.

Portrait by [[Hans Asper]], 1560.]] <br/> The original Roman canon law that defined governance within the Church clearly needed revision following Henry's break with Rome. Several revision attempts were made throughout Henry's reign, but these initial projects were shelved as the speed of reform outpaced the time required to work on a revision. As the reformation stabilised, Cranmer formed a committee in December 1551 to restart the work. He recruited Peter Martyr to the committee and he also asked Laski and Hooper to participate, demonstrating his usual ability to forgive past actions. Cranmer and Martyr realised that a successful enactment of a reformed ecclesiastical law-code in England would have international significance. Cranmer planned to draw together all the reformed churches of Europe under England’s leadership to counter the [[Council of Trent]], the Roman Catholic Church's response to the [[Protestant Reformation]]. In March 1552, Cranmer invited the foremost Continental reformers, Bullinger, [[John Calvin]], and Melanchthon to come to England and to participate in an ecumenical council. The response was disappointing: Melanchthon did not respond, Bullinger stated that neither of them could leave Germany as it was riven by war between the Emperor and the Lutheran princes, and while Calvin showed some enthusiasm, he said he was unable to come. Cranmer acknowledged Calvin and replied stating, "Meanwhile we will reform the English Church to the utmost of our ability and give our labour that both its doctrines and laws will be improved after the model of holy scripture."<ref name="MacCulloch520">{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|p=520}}</ref> One partial manuscript of the project survived that was annotated with corrections and comments by Cranmer and Martyr. When the final version was presented to Parliament, the breach between Cranmer and Dudley was complete and the regent effectively killed the canon law bill in the House of Lords.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ayris(2)|1993|pp=318–321}}; {{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=500–502, 518–520, 533}}</ref><br/> <br/> As in the first Prayer Book, the origins and participants in the work of its revision are obscure, but it was clear that Cranmer led the project and steered its development. It had begun as early as the end of 1549 when the Convocation of Canterbury met to discuss the matter. Late in 1550, the opinions of Martyr and Bucer were sought on how the liturgy might be improved and they significantly influenced the revision.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bagchi|Steinmetz|2004|pp=158–159}}</ref> The spiritual presence view was clarified by the use of entirely different words when the communicants are offered the bread and the wine. New [[rubrics]] noted that any kind of bread could be used and any bread or wine that remained could be used by the [[curate]], thus disassociating the elements from any physical presence. The new book removed any possibility of prayers for the dead as such prayers would imply support for the doctrine of purgatory.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ridley|1962|pp=322–327}}; {{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=504–513}}</ref> The [[Act of Uniformity 1552]] which authorised the book's use specified that it was to be exclusively used from [[1 November]]. However, the final version was not officially published until nearly the last minute due to the intervention of Dudley. While traveling in the north of the country, he met the Scots reformer, [[John Knox]], then based in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]. Impressed by his preaching, Dudley selected him to be a royal chaplain and brought him south to participate in the reform projects. In a sermon before the king, Knox attacked the practice of kneeling during communion. On [[27 September]] [[1552]], the Privy Council stopped the printing of the new Prayer Book and told Cranmer to revise it. He responded with a long letter using the argument that it was for Parliament with the royal assent to decide any changes in the liturgy.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ayris(4)|2000|pp=15–17, 29–31}}</ref> On [[22 October]], the council decided to keep the liturgy as it is and add the so-called "[[Black Rubric]]" which explained that no adoration was intended when kneeling at communion.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ridley|1962|pp=336–337}}; {{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=512, 525–530}}</ref></td>

The Turkish Parliament refused to grant permission for the operation and the division's equipment remained offshore on ships during the buildup for the war.  Arriving through Kuwait after the invasion had started, they were subject to multiple "SCUD" alerts while at Camps Wolf and Udairi, necessitating the retreat to bunkers in full chemical protective gear. The division was unable to deploy in time to start the invasion but joined it as a follow-on force in April 2003 attacking toward Tikrit and Mosul, and later became a major part of occupation forces during the post-war period. Headquartered in Saddam Hussein's former palaces, the 4th ID was deployed in the northern area of the [[Sunni Triangle]] near [[Tikrit]].  The 4th Infantry Division was spread all over Northern Iraq from Kirkuk to the Iranian border as far south as Balad Air Force Base in Balad Iraq.

Nevertheless, by 1984, it was clear that the public were aware of the sexual nature of the lyrics, but the scandal had fuelled sales anyway.

It was a first party game designed by [[Nintendo]] itself, and was released in 1990.<br/> <br/> This game was highly impressive for its time.  It allowed players to choose from ten real teams from various cities, and each team featured all the actual players that were currently playing for them. The game used an [[Isometric projection|isometric]] view, presenting the game at an angle to make it appear [[Three-dimensional space|3-D]], and the game allowed a very large number of moving objects (all the players) to be onscreen at the same time; in earlier games, the system couldn't handle it. In a typical NES game, few moving objects could be onscreen before they all started flashing, because the system couldn't render them all at once, but ''NES PAF'' managed to avoid this somehow and allow the system to render two entire football teams onscreen simultaneously. Another feature that was ahead of its time was the use of real voices. ''NES PAF'' was one of an extremely small number of NES games to feature voices. Most games never bothered to implement this feature because of the primitive sound capabilities, but in ''NES PAF'', players hear the [[referee]] say in a real voice "Touchdown!" or "First down!". You can even hear the football players yell "Ready! Hut, hut.." before the play begins.</td>

It was a first party game designed by [[Nintendo]] itself, and was released in 1990.<br/> <br/> This game was highly impressive for its time.  It allowed players to choose from ten real teams from various cities, and each team featured all the actual players that were currently playing for them. The game used an [[Isometric projection|isometric]] view, presenting the game at an angle to make it appear [[Three-dimensional space|3-D]], and the game allowed a very large number of moving objects (all the players) to be onscreen at the same time; in earlier games, the system couldn't handle it. In a typical NES game, few moving objects could be onscreen before they all started flashing, because the system couldn't render them all at once, but ''NES PAF'' managed to avoid this somehow and allow the system to render two entire football teams onscreen simultaneously. Another feature that was ahead of its time was the use of real voices. ''NES PAF'' was one of an extremely small number of NES games to feature voices. Most games never bothered to implement this feature because of the primitive sound capabilities, but in ''NES PAF'', players hear the [[referee]] say in a real voice "Touchdown!" or "First down!". You can even hear the football players yell "Ready! Hut, hut.." before the play begins.</td>

It features three modes, which are puzzle, battle and arcade. The arcade mode is set in 2D with eight playable characters, while the battle modes are set in 3D. The objective of the game is to shoot a certain coloured block to other blocks of the same colour to create a building. The larger the building the greater damage that is done to the player's opponent which in effect speeds up the moving counter which pushes the blocks ever closer to the edge after which the player or opponent will lose the battle. The game is fast paced on all modes except puzzle which involves more strategy.<br/></td>

Prior to Pearl Harbor, [[Henry H. Arnold|General Henry H.

But he essentially promised the command to Cochran, should such  a force be needed in the future.<br/> While the U.S. was not yet fighting in World War II, Cochran had gone to England to volunteer to fly for the [[Air Transport Auxiliary]] (ATA).<ref name=archives>[http://www.eisenhower.archives.gov/research/online_documents/jacqueline_cochran.html Jacqueline Cochran and the Women's Airforce Service Pilots (WASPs)]</ref> The ATA had been using female pilots since January 1940, and was starting to train new ones as well.

This period led to the dramatic increase in activity for the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]],  because of obvious gaps in "manpower" that could be filled by women. After the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], it became evident there were not enough male pilots.<br/> <br/> To those most involved within the new Ferrying Division of the [[Air Transport Command (United States Air Force)|Air Transport Command]] (ATC), the numbers were painfully obvious. Col. [[William H. Tunner]] was in charge of acquiring civilian ferry pilots. He decided to integrate a civilian force of female pilots into the AAF, after speaking with Major Robert M. Love, ATC staff officer, and his wife Nancy. Convinced of the feasibility of the program by Mrs. Love, who had a [[Commercial Pilot License]], he asked her to draw up a proposal, unaware that Arnold had shelved a similar proposal by Tunner's superior, Maj. Gen. [[Robert Olds]].</td>

Samuelson experimented with different positions on the skis for several days until 2 July 1922.

Experimenting further with the sport, Samuelson hooked up a line behind a [[World War 2]] flying boat with 200 horsepower and reached a speed of 80 miles per hour, making him the first speed skier.<br/> <br/> Samuelson went through several iterations of equipment in his quest to ski on water. His first equipment consisted of barrel staves for skis.<ref name=ABC-history>{{cite web|title=History of Water Skiing|url=http://www.abc-of-skiing.com/water-skiing/history.asp|work=ABC of Skiing|publisher=MaxLifestyle International Inc.}}</ref> He later tried [[Ski|snow skis]],<ref name=ABC-history/> but finally fabricated his own design out of lumber with bindings made of strips of leather.

The first patent for water skis was issued to Fred Waller, of Huntington, NY, on 27 October 1925, for skis he developed independently and marketed as "Dolphin Akwa-Skees." Waller's skis were constructed of kiln-dried mahogany, as were some boats at that time. Jack Andresen patented the first trick ski, a shorter, fin-less water ski, in 1940.</td>

The Sedan was not equipped witha a rear hatch so access to the cargo area required removal of the front seats, the ease of which was advertised as a positive feature. The [[chassis]] was steel, with a [[fibreglass]] body enclosing a large but sparse interior. Windows were perspex except for the front windscreen which was laminated glass. The doors were steel with sliding perspex windows.<br/> <br/> The tyres for the Sedan and Utility were Michelin 125 R12 as stated in the specifications. The four speed dog clutch [[Villiers Engineering]] gearbox had no reverse so the engine had to be switched off and started backwards which provide four reverse gears. Fuel was delivered by gravity feed from a tank behind the dashboard. The fuel gauge was a plastic pipe running from the top to the bottom of the tank with a graduated glass tube section on the dashboard. As a [[Wheels (magazine)]] road test in 1974 put it "it read anywhere from full to empty depending on gradient, throttle and probably Greenwich mean time".</td>

Portrait by [[Hans Asper]], 1560.]] <br/> The original Roman canon law that defined governance within the Church clearly needed revision following Henry's break with Rome. Several revision attempts were made throughout Henry's reign, but these initial projects were shelved as the speed of reform outpaced the time required to work on a revision. As the reformation stabilised, Cranmer formed a committee in December 1551 to restart the work. He recruited Peter Martyr to the committee and he also asked Laski and Hooper to participate, demonstrating his usual ability to forgive past actions. Cranmer and Martyr realised that a successful enactment of a reformed ecclesiastical law-code in England would have international significance. Cranmer planned to draw together all the reformed churches of Europe under England’s leadership to counter the [[Council of Trent]], the Roman Catholic Church's response to the [[Protestant Reformation]]. In March 1552, Cranmer invited the foremost Continental reformers, Bullinger, [[John Calvin]], and Melanchthon to come to England and to participate in an ecumenical council. The response was disappointing: Melanchthon did not respond, Bullinger stated that neither of them could leave Germany as it was riven by war between the Emperor and the Lutheran princes, and while Calvin showed some enthusiasm, he said he was unable to come. Cranmer acknowledged Calvin and replied stating, "Meanwhile we will reform the English Church to the utmost of our ability and give our labour that both its doctrines and laws will be improved after the model of holy scripture."<ref name="MacCulloch520">{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|p=520}}</ref> One partial manuscript of the project survived that was annotated with corrections and comments by Cranmer and Martyr.

It had begun as early as the end of 1549 when the Convocation of Canterbury met to discuss the matter. Late in 1550, the opinions of Martyr and Bucer were sought on how the liturgy might be improved and they significantly influenced the revision.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bagchi|Steinmetz|2004|pp=158–159}}</ref> The spiritual presence view was clarified by the use of entirely different words when the communicants are offered the bread and the wine. New [[rubrics]] noted that any kind of bread could be used and any bread or wine that remained could be used by the [[curate]], thus disassociating the elements from any physical presence. The new book removed any possibility of prayers for the dead as such prayers would imply support for the doctrine of purgatory.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ridley|1962|pp=322–327}}; {{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=504–513}}</ref> The [[Act of Uniformity 1552]] which authorised the book's use specified that it was to be exclusively used from [[1 November]].

While traveling in the north of the country, he met the Scots reformer, [[John Knox]], then based in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]. Impressed by his preaching, Dudley selected him to be a royal chaplain and brought him south to participate in the reform projects. In a sermon before the king, Knox attacked the practice of kneeling during communion. On [[27 September]] [[1552]], the Privy Council stopped the printing of the new Prayer Book and told Cranmer to revise it. He responded with a long letter using the argument that it was for Parliament with the royal assent to decide any changes in the liturgy.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ayris(4)|2000|pp=15–17, 29–31}}</ref> On [[22 October]], the council decided to keep the liturgy as it is and add the so-called "[[Black Rubric]]" which explained that no adoration was intended when kneeling at communion.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ridley|1962|pp=336–337}}; {{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=512, 525–530}}</ref></td>

Most eggs count for a single point, but a golden egg will periodically appear that is worth five points. When an egg is dropped, a number of points are lost. At higher levels, the eggs move faster, the chutes become more convoluted, there are more egg-laying hens, and the chutes may even flash invisible.

It allowed players to choose from ten real teams from various cities, and each team featured all the actual players that were currently playing for them. The game used an [[Isometric projection|isometric]] view, presenting the game at an angle to make it appear [[Three-dimensional space|3-D]], and the game allowed a very large number of moving objects (all the players) to be onscreen at the same time; in earlier games, the system couldn't handle it. In a typical NES game, few moving objects could be onscreen before they all started flashing, because the system couldn't render them all at once, but ''NES PAF'' managed to avoid this somehow and allow the system to render two entire football teams onscreen simultaneously. Another feature that was ahead of its time was the use of real voices. ''NES PAF'' was one of an extremely small number of NES games to feature voices. Most games never bothered to implement this feature because of the primitive sound capabilities, but in ''NES PAF'', players hear the [[referee]] say in a real voice "Touchdown!" or "First down!". You can even hear the football players yell "Ready! Hut, hut.." before the play begins.</td>

In this animation, the red colour represents [[live steam]] entering the cylinder, blue represents expanded (spent) steam being exhausted from the cylinder. Note that the cylinder receives two steam injections during each full rotation; the same occurs in the cylinder on the other side of the engine.]]<!-- NOTE: The animated Gif cannot be re-sized, it will break the animation -->{{clr}}<br/> <br/> Exhaust steam is directed upwards to the atmosphere through the chimney, by way of a nozzle called a [[blastpipe]] that gives rise to the familiar "chuffing" sound of the steam locomotive. The blastpipe is placed at a strategic point inside the smokebox that is at the same time traversed by the combustion gases drawn through the boiler and grate by the action of the steam blast. The combining of the two streams, steam and exhaust gases, is crucial to the efficiency of any steam locomotive, and the internal profiles of the chimney (or, more strictly speaking, the ''ejector'') require careful design and adjustment. This has been the object of intensive studies by a number of engineers (and almost totally ignored by others with sometimes catastrophic effect). The fact that the draught depends on the exhaust pressure means that power delivery and power generation are automatically self-adjusting. Among other things, a balance has to be struck between obtaining sufficient draught for combustion whilst giving the exhaust gases and particles sufficient time to be consumed. In the past, fierce draught could lift the fire off the grate, or cause the ejection of unburnt particles of fuel, dirt and pollution for which steam locomotives had an unenviable reputation. Moreover, the pumping action of the exhaust has the counter effect of exerting ''back pressure'' on the side of the piston receiving steam, thus slightly reducing cylinder power. Designing the exhaust ejector has become a specific science in which [[André Chapelon|Chapelon]], [[Adolph Giesl-Gieslingen|Giesl]] and [[Livio Dante Porta|Porta]] were successive masters, and it was largely responsible for spectacular improvements in thermal efficiency and a significant reduction in maintenance time<ref name="A1" >See section of the [[LNER Class A1/A3]] article on the sharp increase in availability brought about in this respect by the application of the [[Kylchap]] exhaust to Gresley Pacifics in the early 1960s</ref> and pollution.<ref>J.J.G.

The addition of the cap occurs [[transcription (genetics)|co-transcriptionally]], after the growing [[RNA]] molecule contains as little as 25 [[nucleotide]]s. The enzymatic reaction is catalyzed specifically by the [[phosphorylation|phosphorylated]] carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of [[RNA polymerase II]].

[[Pre-mRNA]] undergoes a series of modifications - 5' capping, splicing and 3' [[polyadenylation]] before becoming mature mRNA that exits the [[nucleus]] to be translated into functional proteins and capping of the 5' end is the first of these modifications.

Under the influence of designers like [[Bob Cato]] who at various stages in his long music career was vice president of creative services at both [[Columbia Records]] and [[United Artists]], album covers became renowned for being a marketing tool and an expression of artistic intent. [[The Band]]'s 1970 release ''[[Stage Fright (album)|Stage Fright]]'' with [[Norman Seeff]]'s photograph as a poster insert is an early example with the poster quickly becoming a collector's item. [[Gatefold|Gatefold cover]]s, (a folded double cover), and inserts, often with lyric sheets, made the album cover a desirable artifact in its own right. Notable examples are [[The Beatles]]' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' which had cut-out inserts, lyrics, a gatefold sleeve even though it was a single album, [[The Rolling Stones]]' ''[[Exile on Main Street]]'' which had a gatefold and a series of 12 perforated postcards as inserts (also by photographer [[Norman Seeff]]), and [[Pink Floyd]]'s ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' which had a gatefold, lyrics, no title on the sleeve and poster and sticker inserts. The move to the small (less than 1/4 the size of a record) CD format lost that impact, though attempts have been made to create a more desirable packaging for the CD format, for example the re-issue of ''Sgt. Pepper'', which had a cardboard box and booklet, or the use of oversized packaging.<br/>-<br/>+[[File:Are You Experienced - US cover-edit.jpg|thumb|''[[Are You Experienced]]'', [[Jimi Hendrix Experience]]]]<br/> The importance of cover design was such that some artists specialised or gained fame through their work, notably the design team [[Hipgnosis]] (through their work on [[Pink Floyd]] albums, amongst others) and [[Roger Dean (artist)|Roger Dean]] famous for his [[Yes (band)|Yes]] and [[Greenslade]] covers, [[Cal Schenkel]] for [[Captain Beefheart]]'s ''[[Trout Mask Replica]]'' and [[Frank Zappa]]'s ''[[We're Only in It for the Money]]''.<br/> <br/> The talents of many photographers and illustrators from both inside and outside of the music industry have been used to produce a vast array of memorable LP/CD covers. Photographer [[Mick Rock]] produced some of the most iconographic album covers of the 1970s, including [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s ''[[Queen II]]'' (recreated for their classic music video [[Bohemian Rhapsody]]), [[Syd Barrett]]'s ''[[The Madcap Laughs]]'', and [[Lou Reed]]'s ''[[Transformer (album)|Transformer]]''.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6613107.stm Photographer lives the Rock dream] BBC News.

Conspicuous white [[rhizomorph]]s extend from the base of this structure and help to anchor it in the soil. The outer tissue layer, or [[peridium]], is white to pale, smooth, firm-membranous. The slimy [[spore]] mass, or [[gleba]], is attached to outer surface of the [[pileus (mycology)|cap]], and is colored dark olivaceous to blackish brown. The [[stipe (mycology)|stalks]] of ''Phallus'' mushrooms are called ''receptacles'': they are upright, cylindrical, hollow, spongy, and bearing roughly bell-shaped cap with irregularly branching ridges on the outer surface. Some species have an ''indusium'', a net-like structure that extends from the cap to the ground.<ref name=Pegler1995/> The gleba is slimy and pale greenish-yellow; in several species the gleba has a foul, [[carrion]]-like odor, which attracts insects that then help disperse the spores. [[Mosquito]]es, however, that feed on the gleba are killed, suggesting the fungus may contain compounds that could be used as an attractant or [[biocontrol]] agent.<ref name=Gardezi1992/><br/> <br/> The spores of ''Phallus'' species are small, [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]], and somewhat translucent ([[hyaline]]).<ref name=Pegler1995/> The spores of various Phallaceae species, including ''P.&nbsp;ravenelii'' has been shown to be smooth and featureless using [[scanning electron microscopy]]. Roughened spore surfaces are considered by some mycologists to be an adaptation that results in friction during travel in the air, and increase dispersal distances. ''Phallus'' spores are not airborne at any time in their life cycle.<ref name=Burk1982/></td>

In this animation, the red colour represents [[live steam]] entering the cylinder, blue represents expanded (spent) steam being exhausted from the cylinder. Note that the cylinder receives two steam injections during each full rotation; the same occurs in the cylinder on the other side of the engine.]]<!-- NOTE: The animated Gif cannot be re-sized, it will break the animation -->{{clr}}<br/> <br/> Exhaust steam is directed upwards to the atmosphere through the chimney, by way of a nozzle called a [[blastpipe]] that gives rise to the familiar "chuffing" sound of the steam locomotive. The blastpipe is placed at a strategic point inside the smokebox that is at the same time traversed by the combustion gases drawn through the boiler and grate by the action of the steam blast. The combining of the two streams, steam and exhaust gases, is crucial to the efficiency of any steam locomotive, and the internal profiles of the chimney (or, more strictly speaking, the ''ejector'') require careful design and adjustment. This has been the object of intensive studies by a number of engineers (and almost totally ignored by others with sometimes catastrophic effect). The fact that the draught depends on the exhaust pressure means that power delivery and power generation are automatically self-adjusting. Among other things, a balance has to be struck between obtaining sufficient draught for combustion whilst giving the exhaust gases and particles sufficient time to be consumed. In the past, fierce draught could lift the fire off the grate, or cause the ejection of unburnt particles of fuel, dirt and pollution for which steam locomotives had an unenviable reputation. Moreover, the pumping action of the exhaust has the counter effect of exerting ''back pressure'' on the side of the piston receiving steam, thus slightly reducing cylinder power. Designing the exhaust ejector has become a specific science in which [[André Chapelon|Chapelon]], [[Adolph Giesl-Gieslingen|Giesl]] and [[Livio Dante Porta|Porta]] were successive masters, and it was largely responsible for spectacular improvements in thermal efficiency and a significant reduction in maintenance time<ref name="A1" >See section of the [[LNER Class A1/A3]] article on the sharp increase in availability brought about in this respect by the application of the [[Kylchap]] exhaust to Gresley Pacifics in the early 1960s</ref> and pollution.<ref>J.J.G.

Prior to Pearl Harbor, [[Henry H. Arnold|General Henry H.

But he essentially promised the command to Cochran, should such  a force be needed in the future.<br/> While the U.S. was not yet fighting in World War II, Cochran had gone to England to volunteer to fly for the [[Air Transport Auxiliary]] (ATA).<ref name=archives>[http://www.eisenhower.archives.gov/research/online_documents/jacqueline_cochran.html Jacqueline Cochran and the Women's Airforce Service Pilots (WASPs)]</ref> The ATA had been using female pilots since January 1940, and was starting to train new ones as well.

This period led to the dramatic increase in activity for the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]],  because of obvious gaps in "manpower" that could be filled by women. After the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], it became evident there were not enough male pilots.<br/> <br/> To those most involved within the new Ferrying Division of the [[Air Transport Command (United States Air Force)|Air Transport Command]] (ATC), the numbers were painfully obvious. Col. [[William H. Tunner]] was in charge of acquiring civilian ferry pilots. He decided to integrate a civilian force of female pilots into the AAF, after speaking with Major Robert M. Love, ATC staff officer, and his wife Nancy. Convinced of the feasibility of the program by Mrs. Love, who had a [[Commercial Pilot License]], he asked her to draw up a proposal, unaware that Arnold had shelved a similar proposal by Tunner's superior, Maj. Gen. [[Robert Olds]].</td>

In 2001, Nintendo purchased a sizable portion of [[Gyration Inc]], a company specializing in gyros and motion sensors.<br/>+<br/>+Nintendo has the distinction of historically being both the oldest intact company in the [[video game console]] market and one of the largest and well-known [[console manufacturer]]s, as well as being the most dominant entity in the handheld console market.  <!--The beginning statement of an article should not be a whole description of the subject's history--><br/>+<br/>+==History==<br/>+{{main|History of Nintendo}} <!--It was agreed that this section was the main problem with the articles length. Please do not add anymore information to this section.--><br/>+<br/>+===Early life=== <br/>+Nintendo started as a small Japanese business by [[Fusajiro Yamauchi]] near the end of 1889 as Nintendo Koppai. Based in Kyoto, Japan, the business produced and marketed a [[playing card]] game called [[Hanafuda]]. The handmade cards soon began to gain popularity, and Yamauchi had to hire assistants to mass produce cards to keep up with the demand.<br/>+<br/>+===Middle life===<br/>+In 1956, Hiroshi Yamauchi paid a visit to the US, to engage in talks with the [[United States Playing Card Company]], the dominant playing card manufacturer in the US. Yamauchi was shocked to find that the world's biggest company in his business was relegated to using a small office. This was a turning point where Yamauchi realized the limitations of the playing card business. He then gained access to Disney's characters and put them on the playing cards, in order to drive sales.<br/>+<br/>+In 1963, ''Nintendo Playing Card Company Limited'' was renamed to ''Nintendo Company, Limited'' by Hiroshi. Nintendo now began to experiment in other areas of business using the newly injected capital. During the period of time between 1963 and 1968, Nintendo set up a [[Taxicab|taxi]] company, a "[[love hotel]]" chain, a TV network, a food company (trying to sell instant rice, similar to [[instant noodle]]s), and several other things (including a toy remote controlled vacuum cleaner called Chiritory [http://squirl.info/asset/show/345?c=ToysAndGame&cid=465&i=6]- which was later seen as a two-player game in [[WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgame$]] in 2003). All these ventures failed, except toymaking, where they had some earlier experience from selling playing cards. Then, after the Tokyo Olympics, playing card sales dropped, leaving Nintendo with a measly 60 yen in stocks.<br/>+<br/>+Riddled with debt, Nintendo struggled to survive in the Japanese toy industry; it was still small at this point, and dominated by already well established companies such as [[Bandai]] and [[Tomy]]. Because of the generally short product life cycle of toys, the company always had to come up with new product. This was the beginning of a major new era for Nintendo.<br/>+<br/>+In 1970, [[Hiroshi Yamauchi]] was observing a hanafuda factory.  He noticed an extending arm, which was made by one of their maintenance engineers, [[Gunpei Yokoi]], for his own amusement. Yamauchi ordered Yokoi to develop it as a proper product for the Christmas rush.<br/>+<br/>+The 1970s also saw the hiring of [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], the man who (along with Yokoi) would become a living legend in the world of gaming and the secret to Nintendo's longevity; his creative vision was instrumental in determining the path Nintendo's future (and indeed, the industry's as a whole) would follow. Yokoi began to mentor Miyamoto during this period of time in R&D, teaching him all that he knew.<br/>+<br/>+===Electronic era===<br/>+Nintendo at this time saw how successful video games were and began to dabble in them.  Its first step in that field was to secure the rights to distribute the [[Magnavox Odyssey]] in Japan, which it did in [[1975]].  At the time, home video game consoles were extremely rare &mdash; even the seminal [[Pong|Atari PONG]] console had yet to be produced.  <br/>+<br/>+Nintendo's first video [[arcade game]] was 1978's ''[[Computer Othello]]''; a large handful of others followed in the next several years, ''[[Radar Scope]]'' and ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]'' being among the most famous of these. The early 1980s saw Nintendo's video game division (led by Yokoi) creating some of its most famous arcade titles. The massively popular ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]'' was created in 1981 with Miyamoto as its mastermind, and released in the arcades and on the [[Atari 2600]], [[Intellivision]], and [[ColecoVision]] video game systems (although Nintendo itself generally had no involvement with these early console ports). This release method would be used on several later Nintendo arcade games of this same period, including the original ''[[Mario Bros.]]'' (not to be confused with the later [[Super Mario Bros.]]). <br/>+In addition to this arcade and dedicated console game activity, Nintendo was testing the consumer handheld video game waters with the [[Game & Watch]]. Then, in [[1985]], Nintendo struck gold with its [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] and continued with the handheld gaming market with their highly successful [[GameBoy]]. Nintendo continued producing updates of these two concepts, leading it to become one of the world's most recognized video-game manufacturers.<br/>+<br/>+Now Nintendo's main line-up of video-game systems are the [[Nintendo DS]]/[[Nintendo DS Lite]] the [[Game Boy Advance SP]] / [[GameBoy Micro]], the [[Nintendo GameCube]], and the [[Wii]].<br/>+<br/>+==Gaming systems==<br/>+===Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)===<br/>+[[Image:Nintendo entertainment system.jpeg|thumb|right|100px|The Nintendo Entertainment System]]<br/>+{{main|Nintendo Entertainment System}}<br/>+''Nintendo Entertainment System'', or ''NES'', is an [[8-bit]] [[video game console]] released by Nintendo in [[North America]], [[Brazil]], [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and [[Australia]]. Its [[Japan]]ese equivalent is known as the <br/>+Famicom (Family Computer). NES is the most successful gaming console of its time in Asia and North America, since Nintendo claims to have sold over 60 million NES units worldwide<ref>{{cite web | title=Classic Systems&mdash;Nintendo Entertainment System | work=Nintendo | url=http://www.nintendo.com/systemsclassic?type=nes | format=html | accessdate=February 11 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>. It helped revitalize the video game industry following the [[video game crash of 1983]] and set the standard for subsequent consoles in everything from [[game design]] (the first modern [[platform game]], ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', was the system’s first "[[killer game]]") to business practices. The NES was the first console for which the manufacturer openly courted [[third-party developer]]s.<br/>+<br/>+===Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES)===<br/>+[[Image:Super Nintendo Entertainment System-USA.jpg|thumb|left|100px|The Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]<br/>+{{main|Super Nintendo Entertainment System}}<br/>+The ''Super Nintendo Entertainment System'', also known as ''Super Nintendo'', ''Super NES'' or ''SNES'', is a [[16-bit]] [[video game console]] released by Nintendo in [[North America]], [[Brazil]], [[Europe]], and [[Australia]]. In [[Japan]] it is known as the ''Super Famicom'' (Super Family Computer). In [[South Korea]], it is known as the ''Super Comboy'' and was distributed by Hyundai Electronics. <br/>+ <br/>+The SNES was Nintendo's second home console, following the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. Whereas the earlier system had struggled in the PAL region and large parts of [[Asia]], the SNES proved to be a global success, albeit one that could not match its predecessor's popularity in Northeast Asia and [[North America]]—due in part to increased competition from [[Sega]]'s [[Mega Drive]] console (released in North America as the Genesis). Despite its relatively late start, the SNES became the best selling console of the [[16-bit era]].<br/>+<br/>+===Nintendo 64 (N64)===<br/>+[[Image:Nintendo 64.jpg|thumb|right|100px|The Nintendo 64]]<br/>+{{main|Nintendo 64}}<br/>+The Nintendo 64, commonly called the ''N64'', is Nintendo's third home [[Computer and video games|video game]] [[video game console|console]] for the international market. It was released with three [[launch title|launch game]]s in Japan (''[[Super Mario 64]]'', ''[[Pilotwings 64]]'' and ''[[Saikyou Haniu Shogi]]'') but only two in North America and PAL region (''Super Mario 64'' and ''Pilotwings 64''). Other key titles included two [[Legend of Zelda]] games, and [[Goldeneye]].<br/>+<br/>+===Nintendo GameCube (GC)===<br/>+[[Image:Nintendo_Gamecube_Silver.JPG|thumb|left|100px|The Nintendo GameCube]]<br/>+{{main|Nintendo GameCube}}<br/>+The ''Nintendo GameCube'' was Nintendo's fourth home [[video game console]], belonging to the [[History of video game consoles (sixth generation)|sixth generation era]]—the same generation as [[Sega]]'s [[Sega Dreamcast|Dreamcast]], [[Sony]]'s [[PlayStation 2]], and [[Microsoft]]'s [[Xbox]]. Right up until the console's unveiling at [[SpaceWorld]] [[2000]], the design project was known as ''Dolphin''— this can still be seen in the console and its accessories' model numbers. The GameCube itself was the most compact and least expensive of the sixth generation era consoles. The GameCube was the first Nintendo game console to use [[optical disc]]s rather than game [[Cartridge (electronics)|cartridges]].<br/>+<br/>+===Wii===<br/>+[[Image:Wii at E3 1.png|thumb|right|100px|The Wii]]<br/>+{{main|Wii}}<br/>+''Wii'' (pronounced as the word "[[we]]", [[IPA chart for English|IPA]]: {{IPA|/wiː/}}) is Nintendo's [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|seventh-generation]] [[video game console]].  Its official [[project code name]] was ''Revolution'', and as with the GameCube, this reference appears on the console and its accesories.<br/>+<br/>+The major feature of the Wii is the console's wireless [[Game controller|controller]], the [[Wii Remote]], that may be used as a handheld pointing device and can [[motion detection|detect motion and rotation]] in [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions]]. The controller comes with a "nunchuk" accessory which provides additional controls, including more motion sensing. The controller also contains a [[Loudspeaker|speaker]] and a [[Force feedback|rumble device]] to provide sensory feedback, and can be used to turn the Wii on and off. The console also features a [[sleep mode|stand-by]] mode entitled [[WiiConnect24]], enabling it to receive messages and updates over the [[Internet]] while consuming very little electrical power. The console ships with a [[Wii Sports|free game]], unusual for a games console of its era.<br/>+<br/>+===Game Boy===<br/>+[[Image:Game Boy Advance SP.jpg|thumb|left|100px|The Game Boy Advance SP]]<br/>+{{main|Game Boy line}}<br/>+The {{nihongo|''Game Boy''|ゲームボーイ|Gēmu Bōi}} line is a line of [[Battery (electricity)|battery]]-powered [[handheld game console]]s sold by Nintendo.

They yell at them saying how they don't like them anymore ("forgetting them"). Hemingway (in a cape) howls and says, "Give the boys a break... everybody changes". The fans nod their head and the dog continues, "I mean, look at me. I used to be tiny". The fans nod their heads again and go back to watching Fall Out Boy play as confetti falls down.

As a singles heel through the sixties, he was a top-of-card fixture battling well-established crowd favourites such as Mark Lewin, Spiros Arion, Tex Mackenzie, Dominic Denucci and Mario Milano. Enormous numbers from Australia's nascent ethnic community turned out to support Arion, Denucci and Milano, and Kox risked riots at every appearance. His brainbuster finisher was as famous as his chronic rule breaking and surreptitious use of foreign objects. Fans longed to see the brainbuster deployed on the side of good, and this boon was granted in 1971 when the Killer turned into a good guy in a nationally televised mea culpa - he pledged to change his ways on a solemn promise to his dying mother. <br/>+<br/>+This created much heat in the already booming Australian wrestling promotion, where the fixture was an ongoing television "war" between the good guys referred to as "The People's Army" (Lewin, Curtis, Arion, Milano and visiting faces from overseas) and the "mercenary soldiers" managed by Kentucky biker / preacher Big Bad John. The turning of the tables saw the erstwhile Killer create great excitement in tag matches against his former heel comrades Abdullah the Butcher, Brute Bernard, Dick "The Bulldog" Brower, Tiger Singh, Waldo Von Ehrich and Japanese badboys like Mr Fuiji and the Tojo Brothers.<br/>+<br/>+In the wrestling profession, Killer Karl Kox was always a popular figure for his humour, behind-the-scenes practical jokes and inventiveness in furthering the promotion ("the greatest gimmicks man in the business" said one admiring colleague). His grudge matches were well-calibrated and exciting, building through a series of disqualifications and non-decisions through run-in interference, and often climaxing in a conditional match in which "the loser packs his bags and leaves town." This saw off one or the other of the combatants as they travelled to fulfill other promotional runs in other countries; battle would be re-joined next season when the participants returned for another highly profitable run. <br/>+<br/>+Among Killer Karl Kox's famous matches in Australia, his feuds with man-mountain Haystacks Calhoun usually involved the insinuation of foreign objects into the proceedings by Kox. At the end of one season, Kox "left Australia for medical treatment in the states" when, in a strap match with Bulldog Brower, his eye was nearly removed (the wound was unbandaged to show the television audience). A headline making event was when a television match for the Australian championship against Spiros Arion was declared ended due to time limit by well-loved commentator Jack Little. Kox responded by applying the Brain Buster to the unfortunate Little, who was hospitalized and required to call matches the following month in a neck brace.<br/>+<br/>+=== Stage names ===<br/>+*'''Killer Karl Kox'''<br/>+*Killer Kox<br/>+*Masked Menace<br/>+*"Killer" Carl Cox<br/>+<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:karlkoxdusty.jpg|left|Killer Karl Kox choking Dusty Rhodes]] --><br/>+<br/>+== Championships and accomplishments==<br/>+'''[[National Wrestling Alliance]]'''<br/>+*'''Regional'''<br/>+:*NWA Central States Tag Team Championship (1 time) - with [[Akihisa Mera|Takachiho]]<br/>+:*NWA Florida Brass Knuckles Championship (3 times)<br/>+:*[[NWA Florida Heavyweight Championship]] (1 time)<br/>+:*[[NWA Florida United States Tag Team Championship]] (4 times) - with Bobby Duncum (1), [[Dick Slater]] (1), and [[Jimmy Garvin]] (2)<br/>+:*[[NWA Georgia Heavyweight Championship]] (1 time)<br/>+:*[[NWA Southeast Heavyweight Championship]] (3 times)<br/>+'''[[Universal Wrestling Federation (United States)|Mid-South Wrestling]]'''<br/>+:*[[UWF Tag Team Championship|Mid-South Tag Team Championship]] (1 time) - with [[Sylvester Ritter|Junkyard Dog]]<br/>+:*[[Mid-South North American Championship|NWA Tri-State North American Championship]] (1 time)<br/>+'''[[All Japan Pro Wrestling]]'''<br/>+:*AJPW All Asian Tag Team Championship (1 time) - with Joe Carrollo<br/>+:*NWA International Tag Team Championship (1 time) - with Cyclone Negro<br/>+'''[[World Class Championship Wrestling]]'''<br/>+:*[[NWA Texas Brass Knuckles Championship|WCCW Texas Brass Knuckles Championship]] (3 times)<br/>+'''[[Pro Wrestling Illustrated]]'''<br/>+*''Pro Wrestling Illustrated'' ranked him # '''417''' of the 500 best singles wrestlers during the "PWI Years" in 2003.<br/>+<br/>+== Reference ==<br/>+<!-- *[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/profiles/k/killer-karl-kox.html Profile at obsessedwithwrestling.com] blacklisted link --><br/>+<br/>+{{DEFAULTSORT:Gerwig, Herb}}<br/>+[[Category:Year of birth missing]]<br/>+[[Category:Living people]]<br/>+[[Category:American professional wrestlers]]</td>

The islands were the location of the [[Fuckings War]] between the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Argentina]] in 1982, and their name continues to be a matter of dispute.  The Fuckings consist of two main islands, [[East Fucking]] and [[West Fucking]], and a number of smaller islands, and [[Stanley, Fucking Islands|Stanley]], on East Fucking, is the capital and largest city. <br/> <br/>-======================================================<br/>-                    READ THIS FIRST !<br/>-======================================================<br/>+The islands are a self-governing and [[English language|English speaking]] [[British overseas territories|Overseas Territory]] of the [[United Kingdom]] and are referred to by the islanders and in the United Kingdom as "(The) Fucking Islands".  Argentina and a number of [[Spanish language|Spanish speaking]] countries refer to the islands as ''"Islas Malvinas"'', a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] translation of the earlier French name, ''Îles Malouines'', though that designation is considered part of Argentina's continued claim to the islands, and hence offensive to Fuckings residents and many Britons.  Some English-language media sources use the [[ISO 3166|ISO]] designation of "Fucking Islands (Malvinas)".<br/> <br/>-The first sentence has been established as a compromise consensus between many editors in a long and difficult discussion (see talk page). Trying to either change the sentence to include less (e.g. "The '''Falkland Islands''' are an [[archipelago]]") or to include more (e.g. "The '''Falkland Islands''', ([[Spanish (language)|Spanish]]: ''Islas Malvinas'') are an [[archipelago]]") will be reverted on sight without discussion by many of the editors part of the discussion. If you have overriding NEW arguments, please bring them to the talk page first!<br/>-<br/>---><br/>-The '''Falkland Islands''', also called the ''Malvinas'', are an [[archipelago]] in the [[South Atlantic Ocean]], located 300 miles (483 kilometres) from the coast of [[South America]]. They consist of two main islands, [[East Falkland]] and [[West Falkland]], together with about 700 smaller islands. [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]], on East Falkland, is the capital and largest city. The islands are a self-governing [[British overseas territories|Overseas Territory]] of the [[United Kingdom]], but have been the subject of a [[Sovereignty of the Falkland Islands|claim to sovereignty]] by [[Argentina]] since the early years of Argentina's independence.<br/>-<br/>-In [[1982]] the islands were invaded by Argentina, precipitating the two-month-long undeclared [[Falklands War]] between Argentina and the United Kingdom, which resulted in the defeat and withdrawal of Argentine forces. Since the war there has been strong economic growth in both fisheries and tourism.  The inhabitants of the islands, who are of mainly Scottish descent and consider themselves British citizens, generally support the current state of sovereignty.<br/>-<br/>-==Name==<br/>-The islands are referred to in the [[English language]] as "[The] Falkland Islands". This name dates from an expedition led by John Strong in [[1690]], who named the islands after his patron, [[Anthony Cary, 5th Viscount Falkland]]. The [[Spanish language|Spanish]] name for the islands, ''"Islas Malvinas"'', is derived from the [[French language|French]] name ''"Îles Malouines"'', bestowed in [[1764]] by [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]], after the mariners and fishermen from the [[Brittany|Breton]] port of [[Saint-Malo]] who became the island's first known human settlers. <br/>-<br/>-The Falklanders, as well as many British citizens, tend to consider as offensive the use of the name ''Malvinas'', as it has a strong association with Argentina's continued claim to sovereignty over the islands. Some English-language media sources use the [[ISO 3166|ISO]] designation of "Falkland Islands (Malvinas)".<br/>+The [[Sovereignty of the Fucking Islands|sovereignty of the Fucking Islands]] has been disputed since their discovery, with [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Argentina]] and the [[United Kingdom]] all claiming possession after establishing settlements on the islands. The French and Spanish claims have long been abandoned, but Argentina maintains a claim over the islands. The sovereignty dispute was the source of the 1982 [[Fuckings War]], prior to which the islands were invaded and briefly occupied by Argentina. The United Kingdom dispatched a task force to the Islands and, after a month-long war, the Argentine Forces surrendered and the islands returned to British control. The sovereignty of the islands remains disputed, but the majority of islanders themselves wish to remain British.<br/> <br/> ==History==<br/>-{{main|History of the Falkland Islands}}<br/>-The Falkland Islands have had a complex history since their discovery, with [[France]], [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]], [[Spain]] and [[Argentina]] all claiming possession and establishing as well as abandoning settlements on the islands. The Spanish government's claim was continued by Argentina after the latter's independence in [[1816]] and the independence war in [[1817]], until [[1833]] when the United Kingdom took by force control of the islands, following the destruction of the Argentine settlement at [[Port Louis, Falkland Islands|Puerto Soledad]] by the American sloop [[USS_Lexington_(1825)|USS Lexington]] ([[December 28]], [[1831]]). Argentina has continued to claim sovereignty over the islands, and the dispute was used by the military [[military dictatorship|junta]] dictatorship as an excuse to invade and briefly occupy the islands before being defeated in the two-month-long undeclared [[Falklands War]] in 1982 by a United Kingdom task force which returned the islands to British control.<br/>+{{main|History of the Fucking Islands}}<br/>+The Fucking Islands were uninhabited when they were first discovered by [[Europe]]an explorers. Disputed evidence exists of prior settlement by humans based on the existence of the [[Fucking Island fox]], or Warrah on the islands. It is thought this fox was brought to the island by humans, although it may have reached the islands itself via a land bridge during the last [[ice age]].<br/> <br/>-The islands were uninhabited when they were first discovered by [[Europe]]an explorers. There is disputed evidence of prior settlement by humans, based on the existence of the [[Falkland Island fox]], or Warrah, on the islands, as well as a scattering of undated artifacts including arrowheads and the remains of a canoe.

For the latter a bag may have one or two [[Handle (grip)|handles]]; a [[shoulder bag]] has a strap to carry it on the [[shoulder]] (the bag is either carried on the side of the shoulder carrying it, or the other side). A [[rucksack]] has straps to carry it on the back.

On the other hand there may be logistic or hygienic reasons to use a bag only once. For example, a [[garbage bag]] is often disposed of with its content. A bag for packaging a disposable product is often disposed of when it is empty.<br/>+<br/>+An empty bag may or may not be very light and foldable to a small size. If it is, this is convenient for carrying it to the place where it is needed, such as a shop, and for storage of empty bags.<br/>+<br/>+Bags vary from small ones, like [[purse]]s (e.g. as an alternative to putting small objects in [[pocket]]s of [[clothing]]) to large ones for use in [[travel]]ing like a [[suitcase]]. <br/>+<br/>+Cheap [[disposable]] paper bags and [[plastic shopping bag]]s are very common in the retail trade as a convenience for [[shopping|shoppers]], and are often supplied by the shop for free or for a small [[fee]].

Efforts are being taken to control and reduce their use in some [[European Union]] countries, including [[Ireland]] and the [[Netherlands]]. In some cases the cheap bags are taxed so the customer must pay a fee where they may not have done previously. Sometimes heavy duty reusable plastic and fabric bags are sold, typically costing €0.5 to €1, and these may replace disposable bags entirely. Sometimes free replacements are offered when the bag wears out.

The station is owned by The Colleges of the Seneca, Inc., the legal name of [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges]]. The Board of Trustees of the Colleges are the owners, with the current President [[Mark Gearan]] as its Chair.<br/> <br/>+==History==<br/>+WEOS started in 1947 or 1948 as a carrier current radio station at Hobart and William Smith Colleges, primarily as a means of rebroadcasting recorded lectures from Western Civilization or other classes for students to either re-hear, or in some cases, hear for the first time if they missed class. However, there are records and citations that mention broadcast experiments and other related efforts in earlier years, one involving the broadcast of a Hobart and [[Union College]] football game in 1920. <br/>+<br/>+The station was operated by students, many of which were part of the Delta Chi fraternity. The station's studios were in Smith Hall, before moving to the basement of Sherrill Hall, where real broadcast studios were built in the 1960's. The studios remained there until 1998. <br/>+<br/>+The Station was granted a construction permit in 1970, for 91.3 MHz, at 10 watts ERP. However, this frequency would have precluded Syracuse from getting a public radio station ([[WCNY]]). Through negotiation, the station applied for and changed its frequency to its current 89.7FM. The station went on the air in 1971, broadcasting a variety of programs both recorded and live, all forms of music, news, and sports, including those of [[NPR]]. The transmitter site was on the roof of Eaton Hall. <br/>+<br/>+Through a series of power increases and improvements, the station increased its power and coverage in steps, first to 250 watts, then 460 watts, and finally 1500 watts. The latter moved the transmitter site and tower to the roof of Winn-Seeley Gymnasium in the mid 1970's. The station had an old RCA tranmitter and a Phelps-Dodge 4 bay antenna. <br/>+<br/>+In July of 1988, lightning struck the antenna, and a fire destroyed the transmitter and related equipment. The transmitter was to be replaced and back on the air by the start of the school year, but the transmitter was destroyed in transit in a truck accident. The transmitter did not arrive until mid Decemember of 1988. The Harris FM1-K was installed in a new location in Winn-Seeley gym, including its Optimod 8100A. The STL link was a buried multi-conductor shielded audio cable running from building to building from Sherrill Hall in the old Alpha System fire alarm conduit. The station used to run audio and voltages on these cables, in a home built remote control. The advent of the new transmitter and a new remote control, allowed for the stereo audio, return audio from Remote Pick up transmitters (MARTI) and the data to use this cable, which when equalized, was flat from 15 Hz to 22 KHz!. In 1989, the antenna failed, and was replaced by an ERI 4 bay antenna which is still used today for a translator, W212BA. <br/>+<br/>+In 1994, The station applied for and was granted a construction permit to move the transmitter site off campus. For years, there was an effort to get the station's transmitter up on "Bean's Hill" to lessen multipath and help improve coverage. This came to pass with a move to Stanley, NY, on a tower site owned by [[Ontario County, New York|Ontario County]] public safety. The station went on the air from that site breifly, before moving to a permanent new tower site directly behind the Ontario County Site on Lake to Laek Road. The ERP was raised to 4KW, with a directional antenna, to protect co-channel [[WITR]] and adjacent channel [[WRVO]]. This greatly improved the WEOS coverage area, and added better coverage towards Ithaca. <br/>+<br/>+About this time, The Colleges added W212BA, at 90.3FM at 88 watts to fill in the signal on the campus. This translator broadcasts from the old WEOS transmitter site on Winn Seeley Gym. WEOS is also on the air in Ithaca, at 88.1 FM, 250watts ERP on W201CD, owned by Ithaca Community Radio. The Colleges have an construction permit pending for a new station in Ithaca, at 90.1FM, for 4000 watts. It is anticipated that this permit may be granted in the early part of 2007. <br/>+<br/>+The station's 24/7 non-commercial news and electic music format serves a large audience, with a large percentage of the listenership in the Ithaca and southern Finger Lakes area. NPR New, Pacifica, and PRI programming are a main stay, with local music and other programming, including broadcasts of Hobart Statesmen and William Smith Heron athletic contests. While the music and other programming has changed from its early days, WEOS came full circle, as it joined the Public Radio Satellite System in 1990, after grants were received from The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and the Public Telecommunications Facilities Program to purchase the equipment. The large 3.8 metre satellite dish was on the roof (technically, mounted to the side of the building at roof level) of Sherrill Hall. It was relocated in 1998, when the station's studios moved to its current location at 113 Hamilton Street. <br/>+<br/>+Up until 1990, the station was at the will and whim of the students and community volunteers, as to when the station would sign on the air. In 1988, the Colleges' President, Carroll Brewster charged WEOS to become more consistent in its programming, and to persue adding public radio programming. This was in part due to the adjacent channel issue caused with the main NPR news outlet at that time, WRVO (This was in part a mistake that the FCC made, in allowing WRVO a power increase, that actually interferes with WEOS. This interference still exists to this day, and the FCC did not remedy the error). Due to the "gray area" of no city grade coverage of public radio in the Finger Lakes, WEOS was allowed to broadcast public radio programming from NPR and PRI. WEOS also was a Pacifica affiliate at that time. At first, there was resistance from students, who equated "public radio" with classical music. However, with the programming mostly news and modern music, the quickly went away when Gulf War I occurred, and WEOS became a primary source in the area for up to the minute news and information. It was in 1990 that WEOS started broadcasting 24 hours a day, when many other public radio outlets were signing off at midnight. WEOS's schedule was adjusted so that a bulk of its news and information programming is in the day time, leaving the evening hours for music programming, by staff, students, and community volunteers. WEOS continues to produce the broadcast of visiting speakers, sporting events, live concerts, and other programming, including speakers at Cornell Unversity. <br/>+<br/>+In 2004, WEOS was the first station outside of New York City and the Albany area to broadcast in HD Radio.  <br/>+<br/>+WEOS also originated broadcasts for the NCAA in the early 1990's of the Men's NCAA Lacrosse Championships. This continued in the 1990's, and the broadcasts were carried by radio stations both in the United States and worldwide, including Japan and Australia. WEOS uplinked the broadcasts to both the Public Radio Satellite and commercial satellite carriers. This effort started in 1992 in Philadelphia. WEOS has also distributed web only broadcasts of various tournaments, including the NCAA Women's Field Hockey Championships, NCAA Women's Lacrosse Championships, and the ECAC Men's Division I Hockey Championships. WEOS has also fed the Liberty League Basketball Championships to the web, as web only events.<br/>+<br/>+WEOS was an early adopter of webcasting, using Webradio and Broadcast America for streaming. WEOS has been using Public Interactive for its streaming, and recently switched its format to Mp3 from Windows Media. WEOS also has archives and podcasts of its programming. <br/>+<br/>+Community and corporate contributions (often obtained during year round quiet fund drives) have helped the station grow in its ability to produce more local coverage and support the addition of a full time staff member. The station hopes to continue this growth.<br/>+<br/>+==Criticism and views==<br/>+[[NPR|NPR's]] official news policy states that its affiliate stations should be 'fair, unbiased, accurate, honest, and respectful of the people that are covered'. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://http://www.npr.org/about/ethics/#principles|title= NPR News Code of Ethics and Practices.}}</ref> WEOS subscibes to these policies by presenting varied viewpoints and perspectives, with the addition of Pacifica programming and local productions. However, criticism has come from listeners either indicating the programming it too liberal or too conservative, depending on ones viewpoint. With the other news outlets in the area predominately airing conservative talk show programming, such as Rush Limbaugh, Michael Savage, or Bill O'Reiley, or Fox News outlets, WEOS prides itself in presenting objective public radio programming, and in the case of some programming, the opposite viewpoint. WEOS does not censor its news programming or present only one sided issues.<br/>+<br/>+==Original programing==<br/>+WEOS produces ir originates many programs of its own or from area producers. These include:<br/>+* Plato's Cave<br/>+* The Fisher Center Series<br/>+* President's Forum<br/>+* The President's Radio Show<br/>+* Out of Bounds<br/>+* Unwelcome Guests <br/>+* Hobart Statesmen Sports<br/>+* William Smith Heron Sports<br/>+* Cornell Lecture Series<br/>+<br/>+===Former programs===<br/>+{{incomplete list}}<br/>+* The Nobody Show<br/>+* Homelessness Marathon (still produced, but independent of WEOS)<br/>+* In the Zone<br/>+* To The Point<br/>+* The Uncle Ziggy Show<br/>+<br/>+===National Programming===<br/>+WEOS also produces programs that have been distributed to other stations.

It was written by financial journalist [[Andrew Tobias]] who became famous for his earlier book ''[[The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need]]''.  It covers the financial details of life, auto, health and fire [[insurance]] -- the types consumers normally buy.  Because insurers are always the subject of [[fraudster]]s who say torch their own unprofitable businesses to collect on the insurance, who say murder the insured to collect on the death benefit, who falsify their own deaths, insurance companies need to be on their guard.  In addition, an unscrupulous insurer could in theory make more profits if it could either induce their insureds into settling for less than they are entitled to or from outright wrongly denying valid clams in hopes that a small yet significant percentage would either get discouraged or wrongly believe that their claims were wrong.  This makes dealings with insurers difficult.  This book was the first guide to ordinary consumers into both the math and the business side of insurance.<br/></td>
