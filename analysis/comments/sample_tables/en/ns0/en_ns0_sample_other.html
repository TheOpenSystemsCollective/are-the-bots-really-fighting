These circular graphs can demonstrate the white matter connections and cortical characteristics for single structures, single subjects, or populations. <br/> <br/> ==Structure==<br/>-Connectograms are circular, with the left half depicting the left hemisphere and the right half depicting the right hemisphere. The hemispheres are further broken down into [[frontal lobe]], [[insular cortex]], [[limbic lobe]], [[temporal lobe]], [[parietal lobe]], [[occipital lobe]], subcortical structures, and [[cerebellum]]. At the bottom the brain stem is also represented between the two hemispheres. Within these lobes, each cortical area is labeled with an abbreviation and assigned a unique color. Inside the the cortical surface ring, the concentric circles each represent different attributes of the corresponding cortical regions. In order from outermost to innermost, these metric rings represent the [[grey matter]] volume, [[surface area]], cortical thickness, curvature, and degree of connectivity (the relative proportion of fibers initiating or terminating in the region compared to the whole brain). Inside these circles, lines connect regions that are found to be structurally connected. The relative density (number of fibers) of these connections is reflected in the opacity of the lines, so that one can easily compare various connections and their structural importance at a glance.

According to Memorial's version, Sadulayev's death was accidental; security officials did not know that he was in the house. Memorial reports that on 17 June, about 10:00&nbsp;a.m., a group of 12 FSB officers and local policemen approached a possible rebel [[safe house]]. They immediately came under gunfire as they entered the yard. Two of the servicemen were killed, and the group retreated after throwing a [[hand grenade]] into a window of the house. The grenade blast killed Abdul-Halim.

Bozizé has strengthened military presence along the border and deployed an amphibious force patrolling the Ubangi river. There were refugees from DRC in C.A.R. from July 1999 (when Kabila advanced in the region bordering C.A.R.). The refugees were repatriated following an agreement between UNHCR and the governments of the two countries in 2004.
