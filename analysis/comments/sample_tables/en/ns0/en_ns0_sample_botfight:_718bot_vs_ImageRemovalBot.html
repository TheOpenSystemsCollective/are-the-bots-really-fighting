The Atlantic House was a hangout for other literati of the period.  One, [[Tennessee Williams]], can be seen in photos that now hang in the bar in which he cavorts nude with male friends on the beach.<ref name="ah"/><br/> <br/> In 1950, Reginald "Reggie" Cabral and Mr. and Mrs. Frank J. Hurst bought the A-House. Cabral, who worked as manager, soon took over full ownership and made the long discreetly gay friendly establishment openly so.  Cabral, a collector of art, graced the establishment with such decorative accents as a carved wooden figurehead said to come from the last whaling ship to operate out of Provincetown Harbor and signed works by [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Keith Harring]].<ref name="ah"/><br/>-<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Ahouse3.jpg|333px|right|thumb|A view from the Commercial Street end of Masonic Place.

The dancefloor may have been added by Cabral in the 1950s or maybe earlier. I've no clue when the upstairs Macho Bar was added nor when they started using the bit across the street that is now the restaurant.  All I know is that the 5 parts nentioned were in place since the late 1980s.--> the property has consisted of five parts.  There is the original tavern, now known as the Little Bar, an intimate space with a [[fireplace]] and [[jukebox]].  Upstairs from it is the Macho Bar, a space primarily for [[Leather subculture|leather men]] and decorated accordingly with [[International Mister Leather|IML]] posters, [[Tom of Finland]] images, etc.  In the larger wing, the ground level is a [[nightclub]] with dancefloor.  The area upstairs from this, once hotel rooms, has mostly been (and is currently) used only for storage.  A small building directly across Masonic Way (the short, [[Car-free zone|pedestrian way]] on Commercial Street where the A-House is located) was long-used as a storage space but is now a restaurant called Grand Central.  In the 1990s a sixth area was added, an enclosed exterior area in back and to the right of the large building which greatly expanded the nightclub's capacity.<ref name="ah"/><ref> [[Advertisement]]s from this place say "Provincetown's premier nightclub for over 25 years", hinting that the bottom floor of what was the hotel may have been converted into a dancefloor as late as the end of the 1970s.</ref><br/></td>

This is not dissimilar to the 'snowcutter' trigger on the SA80A2.<br/> <br/> There is also a drill purpose version of the L98A1, designated L103A1. This weapon cannot chamber rounds as the firing pin is cut short and the barrel filled with cement.

Older vehicles (and those in [[developing countries]]) are more likely to have their patterns painted on, whereas modern appliances often carry [[Retroreflector|retro-reflective]] designs which reflect light from car headlights or torches.  Patterns include 'checker board' (alternate coloured squares, sometimes called '[[battenburg markings]]', named after a type of cake), chevrons (arrowheads - often pointed towards the front of the vehicle if on the side, or pointing vertically upwards if on the rear) or stripes (along the side - these were the first type or retro-reflective devices introduced, as the original retro-reflective material came only in tape form).  In some countries, in addition to retro-reflective markings, vehicles are now painted a bright yellow or orange, although in many other countries, red remains the colour for fire engines.<br/> <br/> Another passive marking is the word ''FIRE'', ''RESCUE'' or local language variant spelled out in reverse on the front of the vehicle.  This enables drivers of other vehicles to more easily identify an approaching fire service vehicle in their [[rear view mirror]]s.

As far back as 1867 Parkes at an intercolonial conference had said: ''"I think the time has arrived when these colonies should be united by some federal bond of connexion."''  Shortly afterwards a bill to establish the proposed federal council was introduced by him and passed through both the New South Wales houses.  This was afterwards shelved by the action of the Secretary of State for the Colonies. Various other conferences were held in the next 20 years at which the question came up, in which Parkes took a leading part, but in October 1884 he was blowing cold and suggesting that it would be "better to let the idea of federation mature in men's minds", and New South Wales then stood out of the proposed federal council scheme. <br/> <br/>-<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Mp005988.jpg|left|thumb|A wood engraving of Sir Henry Parkes moving the first resolution at the federation conference in Melbourne, March 1 1890]] -->In October 1889 a report on the defences of Australia suggested among other things the federation of the forces of all the Australian colonies and a uniform gauge for railways.
