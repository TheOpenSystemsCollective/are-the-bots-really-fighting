Arriving through Kuwait after the invasion had started, they were subject to multiple "SCUD" alerts while at Camps Wolf and Udairi, necessitating the retreat to bunkers in full chemical protective gear. The division was unable to deploy in time to start the invasion but joined it as a follow-on force in April 2003 attacking toward Tikrit and Mosul, and later became a major part of occupation forces during the post-war period. Headquartered in Saddam Hussein's former palaces, the 4th ID was deployed in the northern area of the [[Sunni Triangle]] near [[Tikrit]].  The 4th Infantry Division was spread all over Northern Iraq from Kirkuk to the Iranian border as far south as Balad Air Force Base in Balad Iraq.  The 3rd Brigade Combat Team Headquarters was assigned to Balad Air Base.  The 4th Infantry Division also disarmed the MEK warriors in Northern Iraq in July-August 2003.  On [[December 13]], [[2003]], the 1st Brigade of the 4th ID captured [[Saddam Hussein]], former [[President of Iraq]].

Older vehicles (and those in [[developing countries]]) are more likely to have their patterns painted on, whereas modern appliances often carry [[Retroreflector|retro-reflective]] designs which reflect light from car headlights or torches.  Patterns include 'checker board' (alternate coloured squares, sometimes called '[[battenburg markings]]', named after a type of cake), chevrons (arrowheads - often pointed towards the front of the vehicle if on the side, or pointing vertically upwards if on the rear) or stripes (along the side - these were the first type or retro-reflective devices introduced, as the original retro-reflective material came only in tape form).  In some countries, in addition to retro-reflective markings, vehicles are now painted a bright yellow or orange, although in many other countries, red remains the colour for fire engines.<br/> <br/> Another passive marking is the word ''FIRE'', ''RESCUE'' or local language variant spelled out in reverse on the front of the vehicle.  This enables drivers of other vehicles to more easily identify an approaching fire service vehicle in their [[rear view mirror]]s.

As far back as 1867 Parkes at an intercolonial conference had said: ''"I think the time has arrived when these colonies should be united by some federal bond of connexion."''  Shortly afterwards a bill to establish the proposed federal council was introduced by him and passed through both the New South Wales houses.  This was afterwards shelved by the action of the Secretary of State for the Colonies. Various other conferences were held in the next 20 years at which the question came up, in which Parkes took a leading part, but in October 1884 he was blowing cold and suggesting that it would be "better to let the idea of federation mature in men's minds", and New South Wales then stood out of the proposed federal council scheme. <br/> <br/>-<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Mp005988.jpg|left|thumb|A wood engraving of Sir Henry Parkes moving the first resolution at the federation conference in Melbourne, March 1 1890]] -->In October 1889 a report on the defences of Australia suggested among other things the federation of the forces of all the Australian colonies and a uniform gauge for railways.

Of these, Henrietta was the only to marry, and none of the siblings had any children of their own. <br/> <br/> Ernest was the oldest of the children and began his education at [[Santa Clara College]] when he was sixteen. He continued as a student for three years, showing potential in French and drawing. During the final year of his studies, Ernest studied painting with Fr. Tortone, who highly approved of his work. Since art instructors were in short supply in pioneer California, the de Saisset family sent Ernest to [[Paris]] for further study in art.

In December he was put on trial and although the charges of treason were dropped, he was judged guilty of felony and hurriedly put to death on [[22 January]] [[1552]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Loades|2004|pp=109–111}}. According to Loades, a felony, a lesser crime than treason in English law, included gathering men unlawfully and plotting the death of a councillor. Seymour admitted to these actions.</ref> This was the beginning of the breach between Cranmer and Dudley. It was aggravated during the year by the gradual appropriation of ecclesiastical property by the regency.<ref name="MacCulloch520">{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|p=520}}</ref> However, even throughout this political turmoil, Cranmer worked simultaneously on three major projects in his reform programme: the revision of [[canon law]], the revision of the Prayer Book, and the formation of a statement of doctrine.<ref>{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=493–500}}</ref><br/> <br/>-<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:VermigliAsper2.JPG|thumb|left|[[Pietro Martire Vermigli]] or Peter Martyr greatly assisted Cranmer in the English Reformation.

Portrait by [[Hans Asper]], 1560.]] <br/> The original Roman canon law that defined governance within the Church clearly needed revision following Henry's break with Rome. Several revision attempts were made throughout Henry's reign, but these initial projects were shelved as the speed of reform outpaced the time required to work on a revision. As the reformation stabilised, Cranmer formed a committee in December 1551 to restart the work. He recruited Peter Martyr to the committee and he also asked Laski and Hooper to participate, demonstrating his usual ability to forgive past actions. Cranmer and Martyr realised that a successful enactment of a reformed ecclesiastical law-code in England would have international significance. Cranmer planned to draw together all the reformed churches of Europe under England’s leadership to counter the [[Council of Trent]], the Roman Catholic Church's response to the [[Protestant Reformation]]. In March 1552, Cranmer invited the foremost Continental reformers, Bullinger, [[John Calvin]], and Melanchthon to come to England and to participate in an ecumenical council. The response was disappointing: Melanchthon did not respond, Bullinger stated that neither of them could leave Germany as it was riven by war between the Emperor and the Lutheran princes, and while Calvin showed some enthusiasm, he said he was unable to come. Cranmer acknowledged Calvin and replied stating, "Meanwhile we will reform the English Church to the utmost of our ability and give our labour that both its doctrines and laws will be improved after the model of holy scripture."<ref name="MacCulloch520">{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|p=520}}</ref> One partial manuscript of the project survived that was annotated with corrections and comments by Cranmer and Martyr. When the final version was presented to Parliament, the breach between Cranmer and Dudley was complete and the regent effectively killed the canon law bill in the House of Lords.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ayris(2)|1993|pp=318–321}}; {{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=500–502, 518–520, 533}}</ref><br/> <br/> As in the first Prayer Book, the origins and participants in the work of its revision are obscure, but it was clear that Cranmer led the project and steered its development. It had begun as early as the end of 1549 when the Convocation of Canterbury met to discuss the matter. Late in 1550, the opinions of Martyr and Bucer were sought on how the liturgy might be improved and they significantly influenced the revision.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bagchi|Steinmetz|2004|pp=158–159}}</ref> The spiritual presence view was clarified by the use of entirely different words when the communicants are offered the bread and the wine. New [[rubrics]] noted that any kind of bread could be used and any bread or wine that remained could be used by the [[curate]], thus disassociating the elements from any physical presence. The new book removed any possibility of prayers for the dead as such prayers would imply support for the doctrine of purgatory.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ridley|1962|pp=322–327}}; {{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=504–513}}</ref> The [[Act of Uniformity 1552]] which authorised the book's use specified that it was to be exclusively used from [[1 November]]. However, the final version was not officially published until nearly the last minute due to the intervention of Dudley. While traveling in the north of the country, he met the Scots reformer, [[John Knox]], then based in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]. Impressed by his preaching, Dudley selected him to be a royal chaplain and brought him south to participate in the reform projects. In a sermon before the king, Knox attacked the practice of kneeling during communion. On [[27 September]] [[1552]], the Privy Council stopped the printing of the new Prayer Book and told Cranmer to revise it. He responded with a long letter using the argument that it was for Parliament with the royal assent to decide any changes in the liturgy.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ayris(4)|2000|pp=15–17, 29–31}}</ref> On [[22 October]], the council decided to keep the liturgy as it is and add the so-called "[[Black Rubric]]" which explained that no adoration was intended when kneeling at communion.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ridley|1962|pp=336–337}}; {{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=512, 525–530}}</ref></td>

The absence of a flash suppressor also means the weapon cannot fire [[Grenade launcher|rifle grenades]] or mount a bayonet. The GP rifle is based on the L85A1 SA80 rifle, but with absence of gas parts (as above). The GP also has a weighted trigger since it was designed as a target rifle. This is not dissimilar to the 'snowcutter' trigger on the SA80A2.<br/> <br/> There is also a drill purpose version of the L98A1, designated L103A1. This weapon cannot chamber rounds as the firing pin is cut short and the barrel filled with cement. This weapon is commonly identified by two white stripes with the letters 'DP' (DP- Drill Purpose) being painted on the hand guard and trigger mechanism housing. In addition, the bolt is painted red.

As far back as 1867 Parkes at an intercolonial conference had said: ''"I think the time has arrived when these colonies should be united by some federal bond of connexion."''  Shortly afterwards a bill to establish the proposed federal council was introduced by him and passed through both the New South Wales houses.  This was afterwards shelved by the action of the Secretary of State for the Colonies. Various other conferences were held in the next 20 years at which the question came up, in which Parkes took a leading part, but in October 1884 he was blowing cold and suggesting that it would be "better to let the idea of federation mature in men's minds", and New South Wales then stood out of the proposed federal council scheme. <br/> <br/>-<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Mp005988.jpg|left|thumb|A wood engraving of Sir Henry Parkes moving the first resolution at the federation conference in Melbourne, March 1 1890]] -->In October 1889 a report on the defences of Australia suggested among other things the federation of the forces of all the Australian colonies and a uniform gauge for railways.

His talent from the first revealed itself as strictly academical, full of elegance and grace, but somewhat lacking originality. In the course of his residence in [[Italy]] Baudry derived strong inspiration from Italian art with the mannerism of [[Correggio]], as was very evident in the two works he exhibited in the [[Paris Salon|Salon]] of [[1857]], which were purchased for the Luxembourg: ''The Martyrdom of a Vestal Virgin and The Child''. His ''Leda'', ''St John the Baptist'', and a ''Portrait of Beul'', exhibited at the same time, took a first prize that year. Throughout this early period Baudry commonly selected mythological or fanciful subjects, one of the most noteworthy being ''The Pearl and the Wave'' (1862). Once only did he attempt an historical picture, ''Charlotte Corday after the murder of Marat'' ([[1861]]); and returned by preference to the former class of subjects or to painting portraits of illustrious men of his day: [[Guizot]], [[Charles Garnier]], [[Edmond About]].</td>

Members of the [[Penutian]]-speaking family of languages, especially the [[Wintu]], arrived in central Northern California in the vicinity of [[Redding, California]] about 1200 years ago, likely from southern Oregon.  The Wintu possessed superior technology, were out-competing their Hokan-language family neighbors, and were expanding Wintu territory at the expense of the Okwanuchu and the [[Achomawi]] to the north, and the [[Yana people|Yana]] to the east.  It appears likely that even if Europeans and Americans not intervened (beginning in the 1820s), the Wintu would have absorbed or otherwise eliminated the Okwanuchu over the course of the coming centuries.<br/> <br/>-Anthropologist [[Alfred L.

In December he was put on trial and although the charges of treason were dropped, he was judged guilty of felony and hurriedly put to death on [[22 January]] [[1552]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Loades|2004|pp=109–111}}. According to Loades, a felony, a lesser crime than treason in English law, included gathering men unlawfully and plotting the death of a councillor. Seymour admitted to these actions.</ref> This was the beginning of the breach between Cranmer and Dudley. It was aggravated during the year by the gradual appropriation of ecclesiastical property by the regency.<ref name="MacCulloch520">{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|p=520}}</ref> However, even throughout this political turmoil, Cranmer worked simultaneously on three major projects in his reform programme: the revision of [[canon law]], the revision of the Prayer Book, and the formation of a statement of doctrine.<ref>{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=493–500}}</ref><br/> <br/>-<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:VermigliAsper2.JPG|thumb|left|[[Pietro Martire Vermigli]] or Peter Martyr greatly assisted Cranmer in the English Reformation.

Portrait by [[Hans Asper]], 1560.]] <br/> The original Roman canon law that defined governance within the Church clearly needed revision following Henry's break with Rome. Several revision attempts were made throughout Henry's reign, but these initial projects were shelved as the speed of reform outpaced the time required to work on a revision. As the reformation stabilised, Cranmer formed a committee in December 1551 to restart the work. He recruited Peter Martyr to the committee and he also asked Laski and Hooper to participate, demonstrating his usual ability to forgive past actions. Cranmer and Martyr realised that a successful enactment of a reformed ecclesiastical law-code in England would have international significance. Cranmer planned to draw together all the reformed churches of Europe under England’s leadership to counter the [[Council of Trent]], the Roman Catholic Church's response to the [[Protestant Reformation]]. In March 1552, Cranmer invited the foremost Continental reformers, Bullinger, [[John Calvin]], and Melanchthon to come to England and to participate in an ecumenical council. The response was disappointing: Melanchthon did not respond, Bullinger stated that neither of them could leave Germany as it was riven by war between the Emperor and the Lutheran princes, and while Calvin showed some enthusiasm, he said he was unable to come. Cranmer acknowledged Calvin and replied stating, "Meanwhile we will reform the English Church to the utmost of our ability and give our labour that both its doctrines and laws will be improved after the model of holy scripture."<ref name="MacCulloch520">{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|p=520}}</ref> One partial manuscript of the project survived that was annotated with corrections and comments by Cranmer and Martyr. When the final version was presented to Parliament, the breach between Cranmer and Dudley was complete and the regent effectively killed the canon law bill in the House of Lords.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ayris(2)|1993|pp=318–321}}; {{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=500–502, 518–520, 533}}</ref><br/> <br/> As in the first Prayer Book, the origins and participants in the work of its revision are obscure, but it was clear that Cranmer led the project and steered its development. It had begun as early as the end of 1549 when the Convocation of Canterbury met to discuss the matter. Late in 1550, the opinions of Martyr and Bucer were sought on how the liturgy might be improved and they significantly influenced the revision.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bagchi|Steinmetz|2004|pp=158–159}}</ref> The spiritual presence view was clarified by the use of entirely different words when the communicants are offered the bread and the wine. New [[rubrics]] noted that any kind of bread could be used and any bread or wine that remained could be used by the [[curate]], thus disassociating the elements from any physical presence. The new book removed any possibility of prayers for the dead as such prayers would imply support for the doctrine of purgatory.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ridley|1962|pp=322–327}}; {{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=504–513}}</ref> The [[Act of Uniformity 1552]] which authorised the book's use specified that it was to be exclusively used from [[1 November]]. However, the final version was not officially published until nearly the last minute due to the intervention of Dudley. While traveling in the north of the country, he met the Scots reformer, [[John Knox]], then based in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]. Impressed by his preaching, Dudley selected him to be a royal chaplain and brought him south to participate in the reform projects. In a sermon before the king, Knox attacked the practice of kneeling during communion. On [[27 September]] [[1552]], the Privy Council stopped the printing of the new Prayer Book and told Cranmer to revise it. He responded with a long letter using the argument that it was for Parliament with the royal assent to decide any changes in the liturgy.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ayris(4)|2000|pp=15–17, 29–31}}</ref> On [[22 October]], the council decided to keep the liturgy as it is and add the so-called "[[Black Rubric]]" which explained that no adoration was intended when kneeling at communion.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ridley|1962|pp=336–337}}; {{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=512, 525–530}}</ref></td>

External changes gave the car the looks to match its power.  Deeper front bumpers with honeycomb mesh inserts, side skirts, fog lights, a honeycomb mesh grill and 15" BBS split rims suited the car well.  There were also standard extras such as "Climatronic" fully automatic air conditioning, Xenon headlights (with a headlight washer system), a 6 disc CD autochanger, exclusive sports interior with leather steering wheel and gearstick, chrome inserts and driver aids such as ABS with EBD and an EDL (a system to aid traction).
