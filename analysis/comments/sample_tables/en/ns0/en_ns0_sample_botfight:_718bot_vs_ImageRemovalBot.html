Older vehicles (and those in [[developing countries]]) are more likely to have their patterns painted on, whereas modern appliances often carry [[Retroreflector|retro-reflective]] designs which reflect light from car headlights or torches.  Patterns include 'checker board' (alternate coloured squares, sometimes called '[[battenburg markings]]', named after a type of cake), chevrons (arrowheads - often pointed towards the front of the vehicle if on the side, or pointing vertically upwards if on the rear) or stripes (along the side - these were the first type or retro-reflective devices introduced, as the original retro-reflective material came only in tape form).  In some countries, in addition to retro-reflective markings, vehicles are now painted a bright yellow or orange, although in many other countries, red remains the colour for fire engines.<br/> <br/> Another passive marking is the word ''FIRE'', ''RESCUE'' or local language variant spelled out in reverse on the front of the vehicle.  This enables drivers of other vehicles to more easily identify an approaching fire service vehicle in their [[rear view mirror]]s.

As far back as 1867 Parkes at an intercolonial conference had said: ''"I think the time has arrived when these colonies should be united by some federal bond of connexion."''  Shortly afterwards a bill to establish the proposed federal council was introduced by him and passed through both the New South Wales houses.  This was afterwards shelved by the action of the Secretary of State for the Colonies. Various other conferences were held in the next 20 years at which the question came up, in which Parkes took a leading part, but in October 1884 he was blowing cold and suggesting that it would be "better to let the idea of federation mature in men's minds", and New South Wales then stood out of the proposed federal council scheme. <br/> <br/>-<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Mp005988.jpg|left|thumb|A wood engraving of Sir Henry Parkes moving the first resolution at the federation conference in Melbourne, March 1 1890]] -->In October 1889 a report on the defences of Australia suggested among other things the federation of the forces of all the Australian colonies and a uniform gauge for railways.

Available only in hatchback form, the GTI was powered by a 1.6 16V 125&nbsp;PS (92&nbsp;kW) engine with variable valve timing, making it the most powerful Polo to come out the factory to date. External changes gave the car the looks to match its power.  Deeper front bumpers with honeycomb mesh inserts, side skirts, fog lights, a honeycomb mesh grill and 15" BBS split rims suited the car well.  There were also standard extras such as "Climatronic" fully automatic air conditioning, Xenon headlights (with a headlight washer system), a 6 disc CD autochanger, exclusive sports interior with leather steering wheel and gearstick, chrome inserts and driver aids such as ABS with EBD and an EDL (a system to aid traction).  Leather and satellite navigation were also optional extras.  The Mk3F [[Volkswagen Polo GTI|Polo GTI]] however missed the new six-speed gearbox that was introduced in the smaller Lupo GTI.<br/></td>

The term commando was adapted by newly formed British raiding forces during World War 2, and the name was subsequently used by Australian units raised to fight in the Pacific. These centered around the [[Australian commandos|Independent Companies]] and M and [[Z Special Unit]]s. 2 Commando Company was raised in Vic on 24 Feb 1955. 1 Commando Company were raised in NSW on 25 June 1955. Both functioned independently of each other until the forming of the 1st Commando Regiment on 1 Feb 1981. At the same time 126 Signal Squadron (Special Forces) were also brought under command of 1st Commando Regiment until in 1999 they were transferred to [[4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment|4RAR(Cdo)]], 301 Signal Squadron was re-raised to provide communications support to the 1st Commando Regiment. All Australian commandos wear the Sherwood [[green beret]] adopted from the British Commandos. It was first used by the Companies and later continued under 1 Commando Regiment. Prior to 1956, the unit wore the traditional Australian Rising Sun Badge. It was then decided to have a competition in which both 1 and 2 Company members could enter for a new design. The Officer Commanding 2 Company decided on a design by Warrant Officer Ronald Nordhoff, a dagger and [[boomerang]], with the motto "'''Strike Swiftly'''".<br/> <br/> ==Specialist equipment== <br/>-<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:1Cdo.jpg|thumb|Soldiers from the 1st Commando Company parachute with their inflatable boats from an RAAF C-130H into Shoalwater Bay]] --><br/>+[[Image:1Cdo.jpg|thumb|Soldiers from the 1st Commando Company parachute with their inflatable boats from an RAAF C-130H into Shoalwater Bay]]<br/> 1 Cdo Regt is equipped with a range of weapon systems that allow it to tailor requirements based on mission specifics.

The Turkish Parliament refused to grant permission for the operation and the division's equipment remained offshore on ships during the buildup for the war.  Arriving through Kuwait after the invasion had started, they were subject to multiple "SCUD" alerts while at Camps Wolf and Udairi, necessitating the retreat to bunkers in full chemical protective gear. The division was unable to deploy in time to start the invasion but joined it as a follow-on force in April 2003 attacking toward Tikrit and Mosul, and later became a major part of occupation forces during the post-war period. Headquartered in Saddam Hussein's former palaces, the 4th ID was deployed in the northern area of the [[Sunni Triangle]] near [[Tikrit]].  The 4th Infantry Division was spread all over Northern Iraq from Kirkuk to the Iranian border as far south as Balad Air Force Base in Balad Iraq.  The 3rd Brigade Combat Team Headquarters was assigned to Balad Air Base.  The 4th Infantry Division also disarmed the MEK warriors in Northern Iraq in July-August 2003.  On [[December 13]], [[2003]], the 1st Brigade of the 4th ID captured [[Saddam Hussein]], former [[President of Iraq]].  The division rotated out of Iraq in the Spring of [[2004]], and was relieved by the [[U.S. 1st Infantry Division|1st Infantry Division]].<br/> <br/> * OIF 1 Casualties</td>
