According to Loades, a felony, a lesser crime than treason in English law, included gathering men unlawfully and plotting the death of a councillor.

Portrait by [[Hans Asper]], 1560.]] <br/> The original Roman canon law that defined governance within the Church clearly needed revision following Henry's break with Rome. Several revision attempts were made throughout Henry's reign, but these initial projects were shelved as the speed of reform outpaced the time required to work on a revision. As the reformation stabilised, Cranmer formed a committee in December 1551 to restart the work. He recruited Peter Martyr to the committee and he also asked Laski and Hooper to participate, demonstrating his usual ability to forgive past actions. Cranmer and Martyr realised that a successful enactment of a reformed ecclesiastical law-code in England would have international significance. Cranmer planned to draw together all the reformed churches of Europe under England’s leadership to counter the [[Council of Trent]], the Roman Catholic Church's response to the [[Protestant Reformation]]. In March 1552, Cranmer invited the foremost Continental reformers, Bullinger, [[John Calvin]], and Melanchthon to come to England and to participate in an ecumenical council. The response was disappointing: Melanchthon did not respond, Bullinger stated that neither of them could leave Germany as it was riven by war between the Emperor and the Lutheran princes, and while Calvin showed some enthusiasm, he said he was unable to come. Cranmer acknowledged Calvin and replied stating, "Meanwhile we will reform the English Church to the utmost of our ability and give our labour that both its doctrines and laws will be improved after the model of holy scripture."<ref name="MacCulloch520">{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|p=520}}</ref> One partial manuscript of the project survived that was annotated with corrections and comments by Cranmer and Martyr. When the final version was presented to Parliament, the breach between Cranmer and Dudley was complete and the regent effectively killed the canon law bill in the House of Lords.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ayris(2)|1993|pp=318–321}}; {{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=500–502, 518–520, 533}}</ref><br/> <br/> As in the first Prayer Book, the origins and participants in the work of its revision are obscure, but it was clear that Cranmer led the project and steered its development. It had begun as early as the end of 1549 when the Convocation of Canterbury met to discuss the matter. Late in 1550, the opinions of Martyr and Bucer were sought on how the liturgy might be improved and they significantly influenced the revision.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bagchi|Steinmetz|2004|pp=158–159}}</ref> The spiritual presence view was clarified by the use of entirely different words when the communicants are offered the bread and the wine. New [[rubrics]] noted that any kind of bread could be used and any bread or wine that remained could be used by the [[curate]], thus disassociating the elements from any physical presence. The new book removed any possibility of prayers for the dead as such prayers would imply support for the doctrine of purgatory.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ridley|1962|pp=322–327}}; {{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=504–513}}</ref> The [[Act of Uniformity 1552]] which authorised the book's use specified that it was to be exclusively used from [[1 November]]. However, the final version was not officially published until nearly the last minute due to the intervention of Dudley. While traveling in the north of the country, he met the Scots reformer, [[John Knox]], then based in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]. Impressed by his preaching, Dudley selected him to be a royal chaplain and brought him south to participate in the reform projects. In a sermon before the king, Knox attacked the practice of kneeling during communion. On [[27 September]] [[1552]], the Privy Council stopped the printing of the new Prayer Book and told Cranmer to revise it. He responded with a long letter using the argument that it was for Parliament with the royal assent to decide any changes in the liturgy.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ayris(4)|2000|pp=15–17, 29–31}}</ref> On [[22 October]], the council decided to keep the liturgy as it is and add the so-called "[[Black Rubric]]" which explained that no adoration was intended when kneeling at communion.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ridley|1962|pp=336–337}}; {{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=512, 525–530}}</ref></td>

While in the area, he served as a consular representative in San Jose and founded the Brush Electric Light company in San Jose. While in San Jose, de Saisset married Maria Palomares and together had four children: Henrietta, Ernest, Pierre, and Isabel. Of these, Henrietta was the only to marry, and none of the siblings had any children of their own. <br/> <br/> Ernest was the oldest of the children and began his education at [[Santa Clara College]] when he was sixteen. He continued as a student for three years, showing potential in French and drawing. During the final year of his studies, Ernest studied painting with Fr. Tortone, who highly approved of his work. Since art instructors were in short supply in pioneer California, the de Saisset family sent Ernest to [[Paris]] for further study in art. In 1895, he returned to California; however, he died four years later.</td>

His ''Leda'', ''St John the Baptist'', and a ''Portrait of Beul'', exhibited at the same time, took a first prize that year. Throughout this early period Baudry commonly selected mythological or fanciful subjects, one of the most noteworthy being ''The Pearl and the Wave'' (1862). Once only did he attempt an historical picture, ''Charlotte Corday after the murder of Marat'' ([[1861]]); and returned by preference to the former class of subjects or to painting portraits of illustrious men of his day: [[Guizot]], [[Charles Garnier]], [[Edmond About]].</td>

According to Goldman, on the day Lennon was murdered he was scheduled to undergo plastic surgery several days later to repair the part of his nose he supposedly had destroyed by snorting cocaine, which he supposedly did at the Hit Factory recording studio (where he recorded his Double Fantasy album). Goldman did not cite a single name of anyone who might have witnessed this at the studio. Goldman alleged further that on December 8, 1980 (the day of Lennon's murder) not only did the singer's cocaine snorting warrant plastic surgery, but he was in such bad physical condition from drug abuse and lack of exercise that during his autopsy the medical examiner recorded observations to that effect, overlooking the four bullet wounds momentarily.<br/> <br/>@@ -22,7 +22,7 @@\n<br/> <br/> He also alleges Lennon's comeback was only allowed, and then orchestrated, by Ono after she realized her own ambitions at stardom without Lennon were futile.<ref>''The Lives of John Lennon'' by Ray Albert Goldman (1988, William Morrow and Co.)

There is the original tavern, now known as the Little Bar, an intimate space with a [[fireplace]] and [[jukebox]].  Upstairs from it is the Macho Bar, a space primarily for [[Leather subculture|leather men]] and decorated accordingly with [[International Mister Leather|IML]] posters, [[Tom of Finland]] images, etc.  In the larger wing, the ground level is a [[nightclub]] with dancefloor.  The area upstairs from this, once hotel rooms, has mostly been (and is currently) used only for storage.  A small building directly across Masonic Way (the short, [[Car-free zone|pedestrian way]] on Commercial Street where the A-House is located) was long-used as a storage space but is now a restaurant called Grand Central.  In the 1990s a sixth area was added, an enclosed exterior area in back and to the right of the large building which greatly expanded the nightclub's capacity.<ref name="ah"/><ref> [[Advertisement]]s from this place say "Provincetown's premier nightclub for over 25 years", hinting that the bottom floor of what was the hotel may have been converted into a dancefloor as late as the end of the 1970s.</ref><br/></td>

The Turkish Parliament refused to grant permission for the operation and the division's equipment remained offshore on ships during the buildup for the war.  Arriving through Kuwait after the invasion had started, they were subject to multiple "SCUD" alerts while at Camps Wolf and Udairi, necessitating the retreat to bunkers in full chemical protective gear. The division was unable to deploy in time to start the invasion but joined it as a follow-on force in April 2003 attacking toward Tikrit and Mosul, and later became a major part of occupation forces during the post-war period. Headquartered in Saddam Hussein's former palaces, the 4th ID was deployed in the northern area of the [[Sunni Triangle]] near [[Tikrit]].  The 4th Infantry Division was spread all over Northern Iraq from Kirkuk to the Iranian border as far south as Balad Air Force Base in Balad Iraq.

Older vehicles (and those in [[developing countries]]) are more likely to have their patterns painted on, whereas modern appliances often carry [[Retroreflector|retro-reflective]] designs which reflect light from car headlights or torches.  Patterns include 'checker board' (alternate coloured squares, sometimes called '[[battenburg markings]]', named after a type of cake), chevrons (arrowheads - often pointed towards the front of the vehicle if on the side, or pointing vertically upwards if on the rear) or stripes (along the side - these were the first type or retro-reflective devices introduced, as the original retro-reflective material came only in tape form).  In some countries, in addition to retro-reflective markings, vehicles are now painted a bright yellow or orange, although in many other countries, red remains the colour for fire engines.<br/> <br/> Another passive marking is the word ''FIRE'', ''RESCUE'' or local language variant spelled out in reverse on the front of the vehicle.  This enables drivers of other vehicles to more easily identify an approaching fire service vehicle in their [[rear view mirror]]s.

All I know is that the 5 parts nentioned were in place since the late 1980s.--> the property has consisted of five parts.  There is the original tavern, now known as the Little Bar, an intimate space with a [[fireplace]] and [[jukebox]].  Upstairs from it is the Macho Bar, a space primarily for [[Leather subculture|leather men]] and decorated accordingly with [[International Mister Leather|IML]] posters, [[Tom of Finland]] images, etc.  In the larger wing, the ground level is a [[nightclub]] with dancefloor.  The area upstairs from this, once hotel rooms, has mostly been (and is currently) used only for storage.  A small building directly across Masonic Way (the short, [[Car-free zone|pedestrian way]] on Commercial Street where the A-House is located) was long-used as a storage space but is now a restaurant called Grand Central.  In the 1990s a sixth area was added, an enclosed exterior area in back and to the right of the large building which greatly expanded the nightclub's capacity.<ref name="ah"/><ref> [[Advertisement]]s from this place say "Provincetown's premier nightclub for over 25 years", hinting that the bottom floor of what was the hotel may have been converted into a dancefloor as late as the end of the 1970s.</ref><br/></td>
