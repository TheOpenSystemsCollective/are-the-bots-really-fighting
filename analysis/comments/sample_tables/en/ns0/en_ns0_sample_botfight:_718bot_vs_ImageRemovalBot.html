Hurst bought the A-House. Cabral, who worked as manager, soon took over full ownership and made the long discreetly gay friendly establishment openly so.

The dancefloor may have been added by Cabral in the 1950s or maybe earlier. I've no clue when the upstairs Macho Bar was added nor when they started using the bit across the street that is now the restaurant.  All I know is that the 5 parts nentioned were in place since the late 1980s.--> the property has consisted of five parts.  There is the original tavern, now known as the Little Bar, an intimate space with a [[fireplace]] and [[jukebox]].  Upstairs from it is the Macho Bar, a space primarily for [[Leather subculture|leather men]] and decorated accordingly with [[International Mister Leather|IML]] posters, [[Tom of Finland]] images, etc.  In the larger wing, the ground level is a [[nightclub]] with dancefloor.  The area upstairs from this, once hotel rooms, has mostly been (and is currently) used only for storage.  A small building directly across Masonic Way (the short, [[Car-free zone|pedestrian way]] on Commercial Street where the A-House is located) was long-used as a storage space but is now a restaurant called Grand Central.  In the 1990s a sixth area was added, an enclosed exterior area in back and to the right of the large building which greatly expanded the nightclub's capacity.<ref name="ah"/><ref> [[Advertisement]]s from this place say "Provincetown's premier nightclub for over 25 years", hinting that the bottom floor of what was the hotel may have been converted into a dancefloor as late as the end of the 1970s.</ref><br/></td>

His talent from the first revealed itself as strictly academical, full of elegance and grace, but somewhat lacking originality. In the course of his residence in [[Italy]] Baudry derived strong inspiration from Italian art with the mannerism of [[Correggio]], as was very evident in the two works he exhibited in the [[Paris Salon|Salon]] of [[1857]], which were purchased for the Luxembourg: ''The Martyrdom of a Vestal Virgin and The Child''. His ''Leda'', ''St John the Baptist'', and a ''Portrait of Beul'', exhibited at the same time, took a first prize that year. Throughout this early period Baudry commonly selected mythological or fanciful subjects, one of the most noteworthy being ''The Pearl and the Wave'' (1862). Once only did he attempt an historical picture, ''Charlotte Corday after the murder of Marat'' ([[1861]]); and returned by preference to the former class of subjects or to painting portraits of illustrious men of his day: [[Guizot]], [[Charles Garnier]], [[Edmond About]].</td>

The 16V came with the 1.4 16V 100&nbsp;PS (74&nbsp;kW) engine and had options such as 15" Spa alloys and air conditioning.  However more interest was in the GTI.  Available only in hatchback form, the GTI was powered by a 1.6 16V 125&nbsp;PS (92&nbsp;kW) engine with variable valve timing, making it the most powerful Polo to come out the factory to date. External changes gave the car the looks to match its power.  Deeper front bumpers with honeycomb mesh inserts, side skirts, fog lights, a honeycomb mesh grill and 15" BBS split rims suited the car well.  There were also standard extras such as "Climatronic" fully automatic air conditioning, Xenon headlights (with a headlight washer system), a 6 disc CD autochanger, exclusive sports interior with leather steering wheel and gearstick, chrome inserts and driver aids such as ABS with EBD and an EDL (a system to aid traction).

A small building directly across Masonic Way (the short, [[Car-free zone|pedestrian way]] on Commercial Street where the A-House is located) was long-used as a storage space but is now a restaurant called Grand Central.

The Okwanuchu occupied territory south, southwest, and southeast of [[Mount Shasta|Mount Shasta]], California, [[United States|USA]], including the present-day cities of [[Mount Shasta, California]], [[McCloud, California]] and [[Dunsmuir, California]], the upper [[Sacramento River]] downstream to North Salt Creek, the Squaw Valley Creek drainage, and the upper [[McCloud River]] downstream to where it meets Squaw Valley Creek. <br/> <br/> The Okwanuchu were speakers of the older [[Hokan]]-speaking family of languages, with archaeological sites associated with their range dating back in excess of 5000 years.  Members of the [[Penutian]]-speaking family of languages, especially the [[Wintu]], arrived in central Northern California in the vicinity of [[Redding, California]] about 1200 years ago, likely from southern Oregon.  The Wintu possessed superior technology, were out-competing their Hokan-language family neighbors, and were expanding Wintu territory at the expense of the Okwanuchu and the [[Achomawi]] to the north, and the [[Yana people|Yana]] to the east.  It appears likely that even if Europeans and Americans not intervened (beginning in the 1820s), the Wintu would have absorbed or otherwise eliminated the Okwanuchu over the course of the coming centuries.<br/> <br/>-Anthropologist [[Alfred L.

In the course of his residence in [[Italy]] Baudry derived strong inspiration from Italian art with the mannerism of [[Correggio]], as was very evident in the two works he exhibited in the [[Paris Salon|Salon]] of [[1857]], which were purchased for the Luxembourg: ''The Martyrdom of a Vestal Virgin and The Child''. His ''Leda'', ''St John the Baptist'', and a ''Portrait of Beul'', exhibited at the same time, took a first prize that year. Throughout this early period Baudry commonly selected mythological or fanciful subjects, one of the most noteworthy being ''The Pearl and the Wave'' (1862). Once only did he attempt an historical picture, ''Charlotte Corday after the murder of Marat'' ([[1861]]); and returned by preference to the former class of subjects or to painting portraits of illustrious men of his day: [[Guizot]], [[Charles Garnier]], [[Edmond About]].</td>

In December he was put on trial and although the charges of treason were dropped, he was judged guilty of felony and hurriedly put to death on [[22 January]] [[1552]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Loades|2004|pp=109–111}}. According to Loades, a felony, a lesser crime than treason in English law, included gathering men unlawfully and plotting the death of a councillor.

It was aggravated during the year by the gradual appropriation of ecclesiastical property by the regency.<ref name="MacCulloch520">{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|p=520}}</ref> However, even throughout this political turmoil, Cranmer worked simultaneously on three major projects in his reform programme: the revision of [[canon law]], the revision of the Prayer Book, and the formation of a statement of doctrine.<ref>{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=493–500}}</ref><br/> <br/>-<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:VermigliAsper2.JPG|thumb|left|[[Pietro Martire Vermigli]] or Peter Martyr greatly assisted Cranmer in the English Reformation.

Portrait by [[Hans Asper]], 1560.]] <br/> The original Roman canon law that defined governance within the Church clearly needed revision following Henry's break with Rome. Several revision attempts were made throughout Henry's reign, but these initial projects were shelved as the speed of reform outpaced the time required to work on a revision. As the reformation stabilised, Cranmer formed a committee in December 1551 to restart the work. He recruited Peter Martyr to the committee and he also asked Laski and Hooper to participate, demonstrating his usual ability to forgive past actions. Cranmer and Martyr realised that a successful enactment of a reformed ecclesiastical law-code in England would have international significance. Cranmer planned to draw together all the reformed churches of Europe under England’s leadership to counter the [[Council of Trent]], the Roman Catholic Church's response to the [[Protestant Reformation]]. In March 1552, Cranmer invited the foremost Continental reformers, Bullinger, [[John Calvin]], and Melanchthon to come to England and to participate in an ecumenical council. The response was disappointing: Melanchthon did not respond, Bullinger stated that neither of them could leave Germany as it was riven by war between the Emperor and the Lutheran princes, and while Calvin showed some enthusiasm, he said he was unable to come. Cranmer acknowledged Calvin and replied stating, "Meanwhile we will reform the English Church to the utmost of our ability and give our labour that both its doctrines and laws will be improved after the model of holy scripture."<ref name="MacCulloch520">{{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|p=520}}</ref> One partial manuscript of the project survived that was annotated with corrections and comments by Cranmer and Martyr. When the final version was presented to Parliament, the breach between Cranmer and Dudley was complete and the regent effectively killed the canon law bill in the House of Lords.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ayris(2)|1993|pp=318–321}}; {{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=500–502, 518–520, 533}}</ref><br/> <br/> As in the first Prayer Book, the origins and participants in the work of its revision are obscure, but it was clear that Cranmer led the project and steered its development. It had begun as early as the end of 1549 when the Convocation of Canterbury met to discuss the matter. Late in 1550, the opinions of Martyr and Bucer were sought on how the liturgy might be improved and they significantly influenced the revision.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bagchi|Steinmetz|2004|pp=158–159}}</ref> The spiritual presence view was clarified by the use of entirely different words when the communicants are offered the bread and the wine. New [[rubrics]] noted that any kind of bread could be used and any bread or wine that remained could be used by the [[curate]], thus disassociating the elements from any physical presence. The new book removed any possibility of prayers for the dead as such prayers would imply support for the doctrine of purgatory.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ridley|1962|pp=322–327}}; {{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=504–513}}</ref> The [[Act of Uniformity 1552]] which authorised the book's use specified that it was to be exclusively used from [[1 November]]. However, the final version was not officially published until nearly the last minute due to the intervention of Dudley. While traveling in the north of the country, he met the Scots reformer, [[John Knox]], then based in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]. Impressed by his preaching, Dudley selected him to be a royal chaplain and brought him south to participate in the reform projects. In a sermon before the king, Knox attacked the practice of kneeling during communion. On [[27 September]] [[1552]], the Privy Council stopped the printing of the new Prayer Book and told Cranmer to revise it. He responded with a long letter using the argument that it was for Parliament with the royal assent to decide any changes in the liturgy.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ayris(4)|2000|pp=15–17, 29–31}}</ref> On [[22 October]], the council decided to keep the liturgy as it is and add the so-called "[[Black Rubric]]" which explained that no adoration was intended when kneeling at communion.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ridley|1962|pp=336–337}}; {{Harvnb|MacCulloch|1996|pp=512, 525–530}}</ref></td>

The Turkish Parliament refused to grant permission for the operation and the division's equipment remained offshore on ships during the buildup for the war.  Arriving through Kuwait after the invasion had started, they were subject to multiple "SCUD" alerts while at Camps Wolf and Udairi, necessitating the retreat to bunkers in full chemical protective gear. The division was unable to deploy in time to start the invasion but joined it as a follow-on force in April 2003 attacking toward Tikrit and Mosul, and later became a major part of occupation forces during the post-war period. Headquartered in Saddam Hussein's former palaces, the 4th ID was deployed in the northern area of the [[Sunni Triangle]] near [[Tikrit]].  The 4th Infantry Division was spread all over Northern Iraq from Kirkuk to the Iranian border as far south as Balad Air Force Base in Balad Iraq.
