The islands were the location of the [[Fuckings War]] between the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Argentina]] in 1982, and their name continues to be a matter of dispute.  The Fuckings consist of two main islands, [[East Fucking]] and [[West Fucking]], and a number of smaller islands, and [[Stanley, Fucking Islands|Stanley]], on East Fucking, is the capital and largest city. <br/> <br/>-======================================================<br/>-                    READ THIS FIRST !<br/>-======================================================<br/>+The islands are a self-governing and [[English language|English speaking]] [[British overseas territories|Overseas Territory]] of the [[United Kingdom]] and are referred to by the islanders and in the United Kingdom as "(The) Fucking Islands".  Argentina and a number of [[Spanish language|Spanish speaking]] countries refer to the islands as ''"Islas Malvinas"'', a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] translation of the earlier French name, ''Îles Malouines'', though that designation is considered part of Argentina's continued claim to the islands, and hence offensive to Fuckings residents and many Britons.  Some English-language media sources use the [[ISO 3166|ISO]] designation of "Fucking Islands (Malvinas)".<br/> <br/>-The first sentence has been established as a compromise consensus between many editors in a long and difficult discussion (see talk page). Trying to either change the sentence to include less (e.g. "The '''Falkland Islands''' are an [[archipelago]]") or to include more (e.g. "The '''Falkland Islands''', ([[Spanish (language)|Spanish]]: ''Islas Malvinas'') are an [[archipelago]]") will be reverted on sight without discussion by many of the editors part of the discussion. If you have overriding NEW arguments, please bring them to the talk page first!<br/>-<br/>---><br/>-The '''Falkland Islands''', also called the ''Malvinas'', are an [[archipelago]] in the [[South Atlantic Ocean]], located 300 miles (483 kilometres) from the coast of [[South America]]. They consist of two main islands, [[East Falkland]] and [[West Falkland]], together with about 700 smaller islands. [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]], on East Falkland, is the capital and largest city. The islands are a self-governing [[British overseas territories|Overseas Territory]] of the [[United Kingdom]], but have been the subject of a [[Sovereignty of the Falkland Islands|claim to sovereignty]] by [[Argentina]] since the early years of Argentina's independence.<br/>-<br/>-In [[1982]] the islands were invaded by Argentina, precipitating the two-month-long undeclared [[Falklands War]] between Argentina and the United Kingdom, which resulted in the defeat and withdrawal of Argentine forces. Since the war there has been strong economic growth in both fisheries and tourism.  The inhabitants of the islands, who are of mainly Scottish descent and consider themselves British citizens, generally support the current state of sovereignty.<br/>-<br/>-==Name==<br/>-The islands are referred to in the [[English language]] as "[The] Falkland Islands". This name dates from an expedition led by John Strong in [[1690]], who named the islands after his patron, [[Anthony Cary, 5th Viscount Falkland]]. The [[Spanish language|Spanish]] name for the islands, ''"Islas Malvinas"'', is derived from the [[French language|French]] name ''"Îles Malouines"'', bestowed in [[1764]] by [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]], after the mariners and fishermen from the [[Brittany|Breton]] port of [[Saint-Malo]] who became the island's first known human settlers. <br/>-<br/>-The Falklanders, as well as many British citizens, tend to consider as offensive the use of the name ''Malvinas'', as it has a strong association with Argentina's continued claim to sovereignty over the islands. Some English-language media sources use the [[ISO 3166|ISO]] designation of "Falkland Islands (Malvinas)".<br/>+The [[Sovereignty of the Fucking Islands|sovereignty of the Fucking Islands]] has been disputed since their discovery, with [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Argentina]] and the [[United Kingdom]] all claiming possession after establishing settlements on the islands. The French and Spanish claims have long been abandoned, but Argentina maintains a claim over the islands. The sovereignty dispute was the source of the 1982 [[Fuckings War]], prior to which the islands were invaded and briefly occupied by Argentina. The United Kingdom dispatched a task force to the Islands and, after a month-long war, the Argentine Forces surrendered and the islands returned to British control. The sovereignty of the islands remains disputed, but the majority of islanders themselves wish to remain British.<br/> <br/> ==History==<br/>-{{main|History of the Falkland Islands}}<br/>-The Falkland Islands have had a complex history since their discovery, with [[France]], [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]], [[Spain]] and [[Argentina]] all claiming possession and establishing as well as abandoning settlements on the islands. The Spanish government's claim was continued by Argentina after the latter's independence in [[1816]] and the independence war in [[1817]], until [[1833]] when the United Kingdom took by force control of the islands, following the destruction of the Argentine settlement at [[Port Louis, Falkland Islands|Puerto Soledad]] by the American sloop [[USS_Lexington_(1825)|USS Lexington]] ([[December 28]], [[1831]]). Argentina has continued to claim sovereignty over the islands, and the dispute was used by the military [[military dictatorship|junta]] dictatorship as an excuse to invade and briefly occupy the islands before being defeated in the two-month-long undeclared [[Falklands War]] in 1982 by a United Kingdom task force which returned the islands to British control.<br/>+{{main|History of the Fucking Islands}}<br/>+The Fucking Islands were uninhabited when they were first discovered by [[Europe]]an explorers. Disputed evidence exists of prior settlement by humans based on the existence of the [[Fucking Island fox]], or Warrah on the islands.

Unaware of the French presence, in January, 1765 English captain [[John Byron]] explored and claimed [[Saunders Island]], at the western end of the group, where he named the harbour of [[Port Egmont]], and sailed near other islands, which he also claimed for King [[George III of Great Britain]]. A British settlement was built at Port Egmont in 1766. Also in 1766, Spain acquired the French colony, and after assuming effective control in 1767, placed the islands under a governor subordinate to [[Buenos Aires]]. Spain attacked Port Egmont, ending the British presence there in 1770, but Britain returned in 1771 and remained until 1774. Upon her withdrawal in 1774 Britain left behind a [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] asserting her claims, but from then on Spain ruled unchallenged, maintaining a settlement until 1811.

It contains up to 16% [[morphine]], an [[opiate]] [[alkaloid]], which is most frequently processed chemically to produce [[heroin]] for the black market. The resin also includes non-narcotic [[alkaloids]], such as [[papaverine]] and [[noscapine]].  '''Meconium''' historically referred to related, weaker preparations made from other parts of the poppy or different species of poppies.  Modern opium production is the culmination of millennia of production, in which the source poppy, methods of extraction and processing, and methods of consumption have become increasingly potent. <br/>-<br/>-Cultivation of opium poppies for food, [[anaesthesia]], and ritual purposes dates back at least to [[Neolithic]] Europe.  The [[Sumerian]], [[Assyrian]], [[Egyptian]], [[Minoan]], [[Greek]], [[Roman]], and [[Arabic]] Empires each made widespread use of opium, which was the most potent form of [[pain relief]], allowing ancient surgeons to perform prolonged surgical procedures.  Opium is mentioned in the most important medical texts of the ancient world, including the [[Ebers Papyrus]] and the writings of [[Dioscorides]], [[Galen]], and [[Avicenna]].<br/>-<br/>-Recreational use of the drug began in a sexual context in China in the fifteenth century, but was limited by its rarity and expense.  Opium trade became more regular by the seventeenth century, when it was mixed with tobacco for smoking, and addiction was first recognized.  Opium prohibition in China began in 1729, and was followed by a century of exponentially increasing opium use.  British smugglers favored opium as a product cheaply obtained from Indian provinces under British exploitation, which was highly valued and in demand in China.  A massive confiscation of opium by the Chinese led to the first of two [[Opium Wars]] in 1838 and 1860, which won Britain the right to trade opium to every part of China, until more than a quarter of the male population was addicted by 1905.  Recreational or addictive opium use in other nations remained rare into the late nineteenth century, recorded by an ambivalent literature that often praised the drug.<br/>-<br/>-Global regulation of opium began with the stigmatization of Chinese and Indian immigrants and [[opium dens]], leading rapidly from town ordinances in the 1870s to the formation of the [[International Opium Commission]] in 1909.  During this period the portrayal of opium in literature became squalid and violent, British opium trade was largely supplanted by domestic Chinese production, purified [[morphine]] and [[heroin]] became widely available for injection, and [[patent medicines]] containing opiates reached a peak of popularity.  Opium was prohibited in many countries during the early twentieth century, leading to the modern pattern of opium production as a precursor for illegal recreational drugs or tightly regulated legal prescription drugs.  Illicit opium production, now dominated by Afghanistan, has increased steadily in recent years to over 6600 tons yearly.<br/>+'''Opium''' is a [[narcotic]] resin produced from [[Opium poppy|opium poppies]] ''([[Papaver]] somniferum)''.

Eat i<br/>+{{Unreferenced|article|date=March 2007}}<br/>+[[Image:MND title page.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Title page of the [[first quarto]] (1600)]]<br/>+'''''<br/>+<br/>+'''''A Midsummer Night's Dream''''' is a [[romantic love|romantic]] [[Shakespearean comedies|comedy]] by [[William Shakespeare]] written sometime in the late-[[1500s]]. It portrays the adventures of four young [[Athens|Athenian]] lovers and a group of amateur actors in a moonlit forest, and their interactions with the [[fairies]] who inhabit it and Duke of the Athenians. The play is one of Shakespeare's most popular and is widely performed across the world. <br/>+<br/>+== Date and sources ==<br/>+It is not known exactly when ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' was written or first performed, but, on the basis of topical references and an allusion to [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser's]] ''Epithalamion'', it is usually dated in 1595 or 1596. Some have theorized that the play might have been written for an aristocratic wedding; numerous such weddings took place in 1596, while others suggest it was written for the Queen to celebrate the feast day of St. John, but no concrete evidence exists to link the play with either of them. In either case, it would also have been performed at [[The Theatre]], and, later, [[Globe Theatre|The Globe]] in [[London]].<br/>+<br/>+There is no known source for the plot of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'', although individual elements can be traced to classical literature; for example, the story of [[Pyramus and Thisbe]] is told in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' and the transformation of Bottom into an [[donkey|ass]] is descended from [[Apuleius]]' ''[[The Golden Ass]]''; Shakespeare would have studied both texts at school. In addition, Shakespeare could have been working on ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' at about the same time that he wrote the ''Dream'', and it is possible to see Pyramus and Thisbe as a comic reworking of the tragic play.<br/>+A further, frequently ignored source is ''[[The Knight's Tale]]'' in [[Chaucer]]'s [[Canterbury Tales]].<sup>[http://www.shakespeare-online.com/sources/mssources.html]</sup><br/>+<br/>+==Performance and publication==<br/>+The play was entered into the [[Stationers' Register|Register]] of the [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers|Stationers Company]] on Oct. 8, [[1600]] by the bookseller Thomas Fisher, who published the [[first quarto]] edition later that year. A [[second quarto]] was printed in [[1619]] by William Jaggard, as part of his so-called [[False Folio]]. The play next appeared in print in the [[First Folio]] of [[1623]].<br/>+<br/>+The title page of [[first quarto|Q1]] states that the play was "sundry times publicly acted" prior to 1600. The first performance known with certainty occurred at Court on Jan. 1, 1604.<br/>+<br/>+During the years  of the [[Puritan]] [[English Interregnum|Interregnum]] when the theatres were closed (1642-60), the comic subplot of Bottom and his compatriots was performed as a "droll." Drolls were comical playlets, often adapted from the subplots of Shakespearean and other plays, that could be attached to the acts of acrobats and jugglers and other allowed performances, thus circumventing the ban against drama.<br/>+<br/>+When the theatres re-opened in 1660, ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' was acted in adapted form, like many other Shakespearean plays. [[Samuel Pepys]] saw it on Sept. 29, 1662, and thought it "The most insipid, ridiculous play that ever I saw...."<ref>F. E.

In response, Egeus quotes before Theseus an ancient Athenian law whereby a daughter must marry the suitor chosen by her father, or else face death or lifelong chastity worshipping [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] as a [[nun]]. Hermia and her lover Lysander therefore decide to elope by escaping through the forest at night. Hermia informs her best friend Helena, but Helena has recently been rejected by Demetrius and decides to win back his favor by revealing the plan to him. Demetrius, followed doggedly by Helena, chases Hermia, who, in turn, chases Lysander, from whom she becomes separated.<br/>+<br/>+Meanwhile, [[Oberon (Fairy King)|Oberon]], king of the fairies, and his queen, [[Titania (Fairy Queen)|Titania]], arrive in the same forest to attend Theseus and Hippolyta's wedding. Oberon and Titania are estranged because Titania refuses to give her Indian page-boy to Oberon for use as his "Knight" or "henchman," since the child's mother was one of Titania's worshippers. Oberon seeks to punish Titania's disobedience and recruits the mischievous [[Puck (Shakespeare)|Puck]] (also called [[Hobgoblin]] and [[Robin Goodfellow]]) to help him apply a magical juice from a flower called "love-in-idleness," which makes the victim fall in love with the first living thing he sees when he awakens.  Oberon applies the juice to Titania in order to distract her and force her to give up the page-boy.<br/>+<br/>+Having seen Demetrius act cruelly toward Helena, Oberon orders Puck to spread some of the juice on the eyelids of the young Athenian man.  Instead, Puck puts the juice on the eyes of Lysander, who then falls in love with Helena.  When Oberon finds this out, he makes Puck apply the juice to Demetrius. Due to Puck's errors, Hermia's two lovers temporarily turn against her in favor of Helena.  Helena, however, is convinced that her two suitors are mocking her, as neither loved her originally. The four pursue and quarrel with each other all night, losing themselves in the dark and in the maze of their romantic entanglements.  <br/>+<br/>+Meanwhile, a band of "rude mechanicals" (lower-class labourers) have arranged to perform a crude play about [[Pyramus and Thisbe]] for Theseus's wedding, and venture into the forest, near Titania's [[bower]], for their rehearsal. [[Nick Bottom]], a stage-struck [[weaver]], is spotted by Puck, who transforms his head into that of an ass (donkey). Titania is awoken by Bottom's singing, and she immediately falls in love with him. She treats him as if he is a nobleman and lavishes attention upon him. While in this state of devotion, she encounters Oberon and casually gives him the Indian boy. <br/>+<br/>+Having achieved his goals, Oberon releases Titania and orders Puck to remove the ass's head from Bottom. The magical enchantment is removed from Lysander but is allowed to remain on Demetrius, so that he may reciprocate Helena's love. The fairies then disappear, and Theseus and Hippolyta arrive on the scene, during an early morning hunt. They wake the lovers and, since Demetrius doesn't love Hermia anymore, Theseus over-rules Egeus's demands and arranges a group wedding. The lovers decide that the night's events must have been a dream. After they all exit, Bottom awakes, and he too decides that he must have experienced a dream "past the wit of man."<br/>+<br/>+In Athens, Theseus, Hippolyta and the lovers watch the mechanicals perform "Pyramus and Thisbe." It is ridiculous and badly performed but gives everyone pleasure regardless, and after the mechanicals dance a [[Bergomask]] (rustic dance), everyone retires to bed. Finally, as night falls, Oberon and Titania bless the house, its occupants, and the future children of the newlyweds, and Puck delivers an epilogue to the audience asking for applause.<br/>+<br/>+==The ''Dream'' on the stage==<br/>+After the Jacobean/Caroline era, ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' was never performed in its entirety until the [[1840s]]. Instead, it was heavily adapted in forms like [[Henry Purcell]]'s musical masque/play ''[[The Fairy Queen]]'' (1692). Richard Leveridge turned the Pyramus and Thisbe scenes into an Italian opera burlesque, acted at [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]] in 1716. John Frederick Lampe elaborated upon Leveridge's version in 1745. Charles Johnson had used the Pyramus and Thisbe material in the finale of ''Love in a Forest'', his 1723 adaptation of ''[[As You Like It]].''  In 1755, [[David Garrick]] did the opposite of what had been done a century earlier: he extracted Bottom and his companions and acted the rest, in an adaptation called ''The Fairies.'' Frederic Reynolds produced an operatic version in 1816.<ref>Halliday, pp. 255, 271, 278, 316-17, 410.</ref><br/>+<br/>+===The Victorian ''Dream''===<br/>+In 1840, [[Lucia Elizabeth Vestris|Madame Vestris]] at [[Covent Garden]] returned the play to the stage with a relatively full text, but padded it out greatly with musical sequences and balletic dances. Vestris took the role of Oberon, and for the next seventy years, Oberon and [[Puck (Shakespeare)|Puck]] would always be played by women. After the success of Vestris' production, [[nineteenth century theatre]] continued to treat the ''Dream'' as an opportunity for huge spectacle, often with a cast numbering nearly one hundred. Huge, detailed sets were created for the palace and the forest, and the fairies tended to be envisaged as gossamer-winged ballerinas. The much-loved overture by [[Felix Mendelssohn]] was always used throughout this period, with the text often being cut to provide greater space for music and dance.<br/>+<br/>+[[Augustin Daly's]] production opened in 1895 in London and ran for 21 performances. The special effects were constructed by the famous [[Martinka]] Magic Company, which was later owned by [[Houdini]].<br/>+<br/>+[[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] staged a 1911 production with live rabbits.<br/>+<br/>+===Granville-Barker, Max Reinhardt and after===<br/>+In the early [[twentieth century]], a reaction against this huge spectacle emerged. Innovative director [[Harley Granville-Barker]] introduced in 1914 the modern way of staging the ''Dream'': he removed the huge casts and Mendelssohn, using instead Elizabethan folk music. He replaced the huge sets with a simple system of patterned curtains. He used a completely original vision of the fairies, seeing them as golden robotic insectoid creatures based on [[Cambodia]]n idols. This increased simplicity and emphasis on directorial imagination has dominated subsequent ''Dreams'' on the stage.<br/>+<br/>+[[Max Reinhardt (theatre director)|Max Reinhardt]] staged ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' thirteen times between 1905 and 1934, introducing a revolving set. After he fled Germany he devised a more spectacular outdoor version at the [[Hollywood Bowl]], in September 1934. The shell was removed and replaced by a "forest" planted in tons of dirt hauled in especially for the event, and a trestle was constructed from the hills to the stage. The wedding procession inserted between Acts IV and V crossed a trestle with torches down the hillside. The cast included [[John Davis Lodge]], [[William Farnum]], [[Sterling Holloway]], 18-year-old [[Olivia de Havilland]], and [[Mickey Rooney]], with [[Erich Wolfgang Korngold]]'s orchestrations of Mendelssohn. (The young Austrian composer would go on to make a Hollywood career.) On the strength of this production, [[Warner Brothers]] signed Reinhardt to direct a filmed version, Hollywood's first Shakespeare event since Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford's ''[[Taming of the Shrew]]'' (1929). Rooney (Puck) and De Havilland (Hermia) were the only hold-overs from the cast.<br/>+<br/>+*[http://www.laphil.org/resources/piece_detail.cfm?id=1372 Los Angeles Philharmonic notes]<br/>+*[http://www.courttheatre.org/home/plays/9899/midsummer/PNmidsummer.shtml Notes, including production history]<br/>+<br/>+===Brook and after===<br/>+Another landmark production was that of [[Peter Brook]] in 1970. Brook swept away every tradition associated with the play, staging it in a blank white box, in which masculine fairies engaged in [[circus (performing arts)|circus]] tricks such as [[trapeze]] artistry. Brook also introduced the subsequently popular idea of doubling Theseus/Oberon and Hippolyta/Titania, as if to suggest that the world of the fairies is a mirror version of the world of the mortals.<br/>+Since Brook's production, directors have felt free to use their imaginations freely to decide for themselves what the play's story means, and to represent that visually on stage. In particular, there has been an increased amount of sexuality on stage, as many directors see the 'palace' as a symbol of restraint and repression, while the 'wood' can be a symbol of wild, unrestrained sexuality, which is both liberating and terrifying.<br/>+<br/>+==Film adaptations==<br/>+:''See also [[Shakespeare on screen#A Midsummer Night's Dream]]<br/>+The Shakespeare play has inspired several movies.  The following are the best known. <br/>+<br/>+*'''[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0026714/ 1935]''' - directed by [[Max Reinhardt (theatre director)|Max Reinhardt]] and [[William Dieterle]], produced by [[Henry Blanke]] and adapted by [[Charles Kenyon]] and [[Mary C.

Brown (comedian)|Joe E. Brown]] as [[Francis Flute]], [[Dick Powell]] as [[Lysander (Shakespeare)|Lysander]] and [[Victor Jory]] as [[Oberon (Fairy King)|Oberon]]. Many of the actors in this version had never performed Shakespeare, and never would do so again, notably Cagney and Brown, who were nevertheless highly acclaimed for their performances in the film. All critics agreed that Dick Powell, who played Lysander, was horribly miscast, and Powell himself agreed. <ref>Eckert, Charles W., ed. [[Focus on Shakespearean Films]], p. 48 Watts, Richard W.

The full 132 minute version was not seen again until it turned up on [[cable television]] in 1994. The film was then re-issued at its full length on [[VHS]] (its first video release was of the edited version). Later showings on [[Turner Classic Movies]] have restored the film's pre-credits Overture, and its Exit Music, neither of which had been heard since its 1935 [[road show]] presentations.

Gitau also influenced [[Jomo Kenyatta]], having taught him at the [[Presbyterian Church of East Africa|PCEA]] Center, Thogoto, [[Kikuyu, Kenya|Kikuyu]]. In the patron-client reward system established by Kenyatta after independence, such connections were important to success in the public and private sectors. Matiba later left his civil-service career for one in the hospitality industry, establishing the Alliance Group of Hostels based on the South Coast.
