It debuted under the name '''Sega Genesis''' in [[North America]] ([[1989]]), as Sega was unable to secure legal rights to the Mega Drive name in that region. It was a competitor to the [[Super Nintendo]] and the last Sega game system regarded in hindsight as successful.<br/>+<br/>+==History==<br/>+===Development===<br/>+Although the [[Sega Master System]] had proved a success in [[Brazil]] and [[Europe]], it failed to ignite much interest in the North American or Japanese markets, which by the mid-to-late [[1980s]] were both dominated by [[Nintendo]] with 95% and 92% market shares respectively. Hoping to dramatically increase their share, Sega set about creating a new machine that would be at least as powerful as the then most impressive hardware on the market - the [[16-bit]] [[Commodore International|Commodore]] [[Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]] [[home computer]]s.<br/>+<br/>+Since the [[Sega System 16|System 16]] made by Sega was very popular, Hayao Nakayama, Sega's CEO at the time, decided to make their new home system utilize a 16-bit architecture. The final design was ported to the arcade, and eventually used in the [[Mega-Tech]], Mega-Play and System-C arcade machines. Any game made for the Mega Drive hardware could easily be [[porting|ported]] to these systems.<br/>+<br/>+The first name Sega considered for their console was the MK-1601, but they ultimately decided to call it the "Sega Mega Drive". "Mega" had the connotation of superiority, and "Drive" had the connotation of speed and power. Sega used the name Mega Drive for the Japanese, European, [[Asia]]n, [[Australia]]n and [[Brazil]]ian versions of the console. The North American version went by the name "Genesis" due to a trademark dispute, while the [[South Korea]]n versions were called Super Gam*Boy (수퍼겜보이) and Super Aladdin Boy ([[Transliteration|transliterated]] from 수퍼알라딘보이; this was the Korean version of Mega Drive 2). The Korean-market consoles were licensed and distributed by [[Samsung Electronics]].<br/>+<br/>+===Launch titles===<br/>+For information on launch titles in all regions, see the [[Launch_title#Sega_Mega_Drive.2FGenesis|the article on launch titles]].<br/>+<br/>+===Japanese release===<br/>+[[Image:Sega Mega Drive original model.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Japanese Sega Mega Drive]]<br/>+The Mega Drive was released in [[Japan]] in [[October 29]], [[1988]] for ¥21,000, almost exactly a year after the first console popularly classed as a 16-bit machine - the [[Nippon Electric Corporation|NEC]] [[PC Engine]]. Although this initially caused slow sales, the Mega Drive soon eclipsed the earlier machine in popularity. However, after the release of the PC-Engine CD add-on and the [[Nintendo Super Famicom]], the Mega Drive soon lost ground. The Mega Drive was not as popular as the two aforementioned systems in Japan.<br/>+<br/>+===European release===<br/>+The European release was on November 30, 1990 in the United Kingdom and [[The Republic of Ireland]], priced at £189.99. The first UK shipment of 30,000 units was sold at retailers Comet, [[Dixons]], [[Rumbelows]] and [[Toys R Us]]<ref>Foulger, C. (2000).

Sega was not able to meet the initial release date and [[United States|U.S.]] sales began on [[August 14]], [[1989]] in [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles]]<ref>Steven L. Kent,  ''The Ultimate History of Video Games'', p. 404.</ref> with a suggested retail price of [[United States Dollar|$]]200 at launch. The Genesis was released in the rest of North America on [[September 15]] of the same year with the price reduced slightly to $190.<br/>+[[Image:MD_Sonic_the_Hedgehog.png|thumb|left|A typical in-game screenshot of ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit)|Sonic The Hedgehog]]'', taken from its first [[level (video games)|level]], Green Hill Zone (Act 1).]]<br/>+The Genesis initially competed against the 8-bit [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]], over which it had superior graphics and sound. Nonetheless, it had a hard time overcoming Nintendo's ubiquitous presence in the consumer's home and the huge catalog of popular games already available for it. In an attempt to build themselves a significant consumer base, Sega decided to focus on slightly older buyers, especially young men in their late teens and early 20s who would have more disposable income and who were anxious for more "grown-up" titles with more mature content and/or more in-depth game play. As such, Sega released titles such as ''[[Altered Beast]]'' and the ''[[Phantasy Star series]]''. Although the NES and [[Nintendo]]'s impending [[Super Nintendo|SNES]] were still threats to Sega's market share, they had forced the theoretically competitive [[TurboGrafx 16]] system into relative obscurity, thanks in part to [[NEC Corporation|NEC]]'s poor [[North America]]n marketing campaign.<br/>+<br/>+Eventually, the main competition for the Genesis became Nintendo's 16-bit [[Super Nintendo|SNES]], over which it had a head start in terms of user base and number of games, reversing the problem Sega had faced against the NES. The Genesis continued to hold on to a healthy fan base composed significantly of [[role-playing game|RPG]] and sports games fans. The release of ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (Genesis)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' in 1991 began to threaten Nintendo's up-to-then stranglehold on the number one console position in the USA. ''Sonic'' was released to replace former mascot [[Alex Kidd]], and to provide the "[[killer application|killer app]]" that Sega needed. This sparked what was arguably the greatest [[console wars|console war]] in North American video gaming history.<br/>+<br/>+By [[1992]], Sega was enjoying a stronghold on the market, holding a 55% market share in North America. Faced with a slight recession in sales and a brief loss of market share to the SNES, Sega again looked to Sonic to rejuvenate sales. The release of the highly anticipated ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 2]]'', coinciding with an aggressive ad campaign that took shots at Nintendo, fueled Genesis sales a while longer and boosted Sega's market share percentage back up, to an astounding 65%.<br/>+[[Image:MD_Phantasy_Star_4.png|thumb|200px|right|A screenshot of ''[[Phantasy Star IV]]''.]]<br/>+Less than a year later, in [[1993]], Sega released a redesigned version of the console at a newly reduced price. By consolidating the internal chipset onto a smaller, unified motherboard, Sega was able to both physically reduce the system's size and bring down production costs by simplifying the assembly procedure and reducing the number of [[integrated circuit]]s required for each unit.<br/>+<br/>+Aside from the release of the [[Sega CD]] and [[Sega 32X|32X]] add-ons for the Genesis/Mega Drive, Sega's last big announcement came in the form of a partnership with Time Warner in the [[United States|U.S.]] to offer a subscription-based service called [[Sega Channel]], which would allow subscribers to "download" games on a month-by-month basis.<br/>+<br/>+===Decline in market share===<br/>+The failures of the Sega CD and 32X, a lack of effective advertising, and disputes between [[Sega|Sega of America]] and [[Sega of Japan]] had taken their toll on the company. By [[1994]], Sega's market share had dropped from 65% to 35%, and the official announcements of newer, more powerful consoles, such as the [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]], [[Sony PlayStation|Playstation]], and [[Nintendo 64|N64]] signaled that the 16-bit era was drawing to a close. Interest in the Genesis suffered greatly as a result, compounding its already falling sales. In 1996, less than a year after the debut of their [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]] console, Sega quickly brought their participation in the 16-bit era to an end by discontinuing production of the Genesis and its associated accessories. This obviously angered consumers around the world who had bought the Sega CD and 32X attachments only to see Sega abandon all support. This can, at least in slight, be seen as a contributing factor to the downfall of Sega as a console manufacturer. (see [[Computer and video games|Video game market]]).<br/>+<br/>+===Resurgent popularity ===<br/>+In recent years, there has been something of a revival of interest in the Mega Drive/Genesis, led largely by the [[grey market]] trade in both unlicensed cartridges (for instance, the biblically themed output of [[Wisdom Tree]]) and dumped [[Read-only memory|ROMs]], which are played through [[emulator]]s such as [[Kega Fusion]], [[GENS]], or [[Genecyst]].

The 16-bit design is based upon the 8-bit design, albeit enhanced and extended in many areas. As the cartridge slot is of a completely different shape, Sega released the ''Power Base Converter'', a separate device that sat between a Master System cartridge and the new shape of cartridge slot. Due to the high level of [[backwards compatibility]], the Power Base Converter does not contain any Master System components - it is essentially a method of fitting a square peg into a round hole. The converter contained 2 slots. The top slot was for cartridge based games. The front slot was for card based games. The Power Base Converter would be fully compatible with the Genesis 2, were it not for the different shape of the Genesis 2's casing. One can remove or modify the PBC casing, allowing it to work on a Genesis 2.<br/>+<br/>+In order to achieve backwards compatibility, the original Master System central processor and sound chip (the [[Z80]] and SN76489) are included in the Mega Drive/Genesis and the new Video Display Processor is capable of the Master System VDP's mode 4 (though it cannot run in modes 0, 1, 2, or 3). Once an 8-bit game is inserted, the system's bus controller chip (later integrated with the I/O chip into a single multi-purpose ASIC) will put the Z80 in control leaving the 68000 idle. <br/>+<br/>+Both 2-button Master System pads and standard Genesis pads can be used to play SMS games. Due to slight differences in how the Genesis pads operate, some Master System games may inadvertently cause the wrong set of inputs to be selected in a 3/6-button pad and prevent input from working properly. In this case a Master System controller must be used. Like the Master System, the PAUSE button is not part of the gamepad connector and instead is implemented as a pushbutton switch on the Power Base Converter or similar devices.<br/>+<br/>+In Japan, the device was known as the Mega Adaptor and the PAL variant was called the ''Master System Converter''. In order to make it compatible with the new Mega Drive II, a second PAL converter, the ''Master System Converter II'', was also released.<br/>+<br/>+==Trivia==<br/>+{{quote box|quote=<br/>+Genesis does!<br /><br/>+'''16-bit arcade graphics!'''<br /><br/>+You can't do this on Nintendo!<br /><br/>+Genesis does! <br /><br/>+'''16-bit sports action!'''<br /><br/>+You can't do this on Nintendo!<br /><br/>+Genesis does,<br /><br/>+Genesis does,<br /><br/>+Genesis does,<br /><br/>+Genesis does,<br /><br/>+Genesis does!<br /><br/>+Get Joe Montana Free!<br /><br/>+Pat Riley Free!<br /><br/>+"Buster" Douglas Free!<br /><br/>+Super Monaco GP Free!<br /><br/>+Or Columns Free!<br /><br/>+Genesis does<br /><br/>+What Nintendon't.<br/>+|source=Genesis [[jingle]]}}<br/>+* Majesco's Genesis 3 (single-chip and dual-chip versions) retains the Mode 4 support but has the Master System compatibility removed from the bus controller logic. This renders the Power Base Converter or any other adapter useless. 68000 software can still enable and use Mode 4, however.<br/>+* One of the 68000's instructions, TAS, is intended for [[Semaphore (programming)|semaphore]] communication in multiprocessor machines and locks the 68000 bus during memory access. The Sega hardware did not support this unusual bus cycle and ignored the write-back phase. Two games, Gargoyles from Buena Vista Interactive, and Ex-Mutants from Sega make use of the TAS instructions and expect it not to write to memory. As a result, these games work on original Sega machines but not the Majesco Genesis 3, which has correct support for TAS.<br/>+* It is possible to overclock the Motorola 68000 CPU in some cases in excess of 300% (the current known world record is 25.4 MHz), though it may not be completely stable beyond a certain point on each console. <ref><br/>+{{cite web<br/>+| url = http://www.epicgaming.us/md_oc/howto.php guide at Epic Gaming<br/>+| title = MegaDrive/Genesis Overclocking<br/>+| accessdate = 2006-09-24<br/>+| accessmonthday = <br/>+| accessyear = <br/>+| author = <br/>+| last = <br/>+| first = <br/>+| authorlink = <br/>+| coauthors = <br/>+| date = <br/>+| year = <br/>+| month = <br/>+| format = <br/>+| work = <br/>+| publisher = <br/>+| pages = <br/>+| language = <br/>+| archiveurl = <br/>+| archivedate = <br/>+}}</ref><br/>+* Another curious modification is to replace the stock 68000 processor with a [[Motorola 68010|68010]]. Since the CPU isn't socketed, this requires the removal of the old CPU, and soldering in of the new. The 68010 is a pin-compatible, 'enhanced' version of the 68000, which is a bit more efficient internally and offers some new features. According to modder Robert Ivy, upgrading the CPU to a 68010 does not necessarily make the games run faster, it just reduces how much they slow down in intensive situations. Also, for some reason, the DAC's digital audio output sounds cleaner and less distorted. However, the 68010 is not 100% object code-compatible with the 68000, so machines modified with a 68010 processor are not able to run certain games properly; such as Sonic 3, Sonic and Knuckles, Street Fighter II, Red Zone, and a few others.<br/>+* Contrary to popular belief, Model MK-1631 (Mega Drive/Genesis 2) ''does'' have a Z80 CPU. Depending on the board revision, the system has either a Zilog Z84C00 or a Custom Sega 315-5676 or similar. Because the Z80 is used for sound production by many games it is a necessary component. The idea that the redesigned machine has no Z80 came from reports of incompatibility between those models and the Power Base Converter, which provides Sega Master System compatibility, but the true prohibiting factor is the shape of the device. The redesigned cartridge port is too far forward on the system to connect a Power Base Converter without first removing its plastic housing.<br/>+*There is a song promoting the console featuring the Genesis [[slogan]] "''[[Genesis does what Nintendon't]]''".<br/>+* A later slogan flashed text on the screen: "WELCO METOT HENEX TLEVEL", a fractured way of saying "WELCOME TO THE NEXT LEVEL".<br/>+<br/>+==See also==<br/>+* [[Sega Mega-CD]] add-on<br/>+* [[Sega 32X]] add-on<br/>+* [[List of Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis games]]<br/>+* [[:Category:Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis games]]<br/>+* [[List of Mega Drive game music]]<br/>+*[[.smd]]<br/>+<br/>+==References==<br/>+{{Dedicated video game consoles}}<br/>+<div class="references-small"><references /></div><br/>+<br/>+==External links==<br/>+* {{gameinfo|Sega MegaDrive}}<br/>+* [http://www.sega-16.com Sega-16] - The definitive online home for the Genesis, with hundreds of reviews and articles.<br/>+* [http://www.eidolons-inn.net/segabase/SegaBase-Genesis.html SegaBase] - Comprehensive history of this system<br/>+* [http://www.guardiana.net/ Megadrive & Genesis Games Database] - Probably the most serious and complete DB<br/>+* [http://www.retrojunk.com/details_commercial/1220/ Sega Teradrive Commercial] - @ Retrojunk.com<br/>+===Technical Information===<br/>+*[http://www.gamesx.com/avpinouts/genesisav.htm A/V Pinouts]<br/>+*[http://www.gamesx.com/cartouts/gennycart.htm Cartridge Pinout]<br/>+*[http://www.gamesx.com/cartouts/gennyport.htm Expansion Port Pinout]<br/>+*[http://www.gamesx.com/controldata/gencont.htm Controller Information]<br/>+<br/>+{{Sega|Mega Drive/Genesis}}<br/>+<br/>+[[Category:Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis| ]]<br/>+[[Category:Fourth-generation video game consoles]]<br/>+[[Category:1988 introductions]]<br/>+[[Category:1989 introductions]]<br/>+[[Category:1990 introductions]]<br/>+<br/>+[[ar:ميغا درايف]]<br/>+[[br:Sega Mega Drive]]<br/>+[[ca:Mega Drive]]<br/>+[[de:Sega Mega Drive]]<br/>+[[eo:Mega Drive]]<br/>+[[es:Sega Mega Drive]]<br/>+[[fi:Sega Mega Drive]]<br/>+[[fr:Megadrive]]<br/>+[[gl:Mega Drive]]<br/>+[[hr:Sega Mega Drive]]<br/>+[[it:Sega Mega Drive]]<br/>+[[ja:メガドライブ]]<br/>+[[ko:메가 드라이브]]<br/>+[[nl:Sega Mega Drive]]<br/>+[[nn:Sega Megadrive]]<br/>+[[no:Sega Mega Drive]]<br/>+[[pl:Sega Mega Drive]]<br/>+[[pt:Sega Mega Drive]]<br/>+[[ru:Sega Mega Drive]]<br/>+[[simple:Sega Mega Drive]]<br/>+[[sk:Sega Mega Drive]]<br/>+[[sv:Sega Mega Drive]]<br/>+[[zh:Mega Drive]]</td>

The Russian [[Terek Cossack Host]] was established in lowland Chechnya in 1577 by free [[Cossacks]] who were resettled from the [[Volga]] to the [[Terek River]]. In 1783, Russia and the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] kingdom of [[Kartl-Kakheti]] signed the [[Treaty of Georgievsk]], under which Kartl-Kakheti became a Russian [[protectorate]]. To secure communications with Georgia and other regions of the [[Transcaucasia]], the [[Russian Empire]] began spreading its influence into the Caucasus region, starting the [[Caucasus War]] in 1817. Russian forces first moved into [[Highland (geography)|highland]] Chechnya in 1830, and the conflict in the area lasted until 1859, when a 250,000-strong army under [[Aleksandr Baryatinsky|General Baryatinsky]] broke down the highlanders' resistance. Frequent uprisings in the Caucasus also occurred during the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877–78]].<br/> <br/> ===Soviet Union===<br/>-Following the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], Chechens established a short-lived [[Caucasian Imamate]] which included parts of Chechnya, [[Dagestan]] and [[Ingushetia]]; there was also the secular pan-Caucasian [[Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus]].<ref>Armstrong, Patrick.

In November 2003, an article appeared in the weekly [[Moskovskiye Novosti]], authored by an investigative journalist, Igor Korolkov.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Krolkov|first1=Igor|title=Фоторобот не первой свежести|url=http://www.index.org.ru/turma/ic/2003/213/739-7.htm|agency=[[Moskovskiye Novosti]]|issue=213 (739)|date=11 November 2003}}</ref> It described a meeting between [[Mikhail Trepashkin]] and Mark Blumenfeld, a former businessman who had rented the basement in the apartment house on Guryanov Street to Gochiyaev, in which Mr Blumenfeld stated that the person who was making use of the Laipanov passport, and who was publicly presented by the investigation as Gochiyaev, was not in fact Gochiyaev. In Lefortovo Prison, Blumenfeld had been shown a photo of someone he was told was Gochiyaev but Blumenfeld replied that he had never seen the man but the investigators insisted that he identify Gochiyaev, at which point Blumenfeld ceased arguing and signed the document. The person who had met Blumenfeld was evidently not the same person depicted in the photograph but was, according to Blumenfeld, a man with a simple face whereas the person Blumenfeld had actually met looked externally like an intellectual. False-Laiponov had been seen by several persons. They all maintained that the original composite photo was very similar to the actual person who rented the storage facilities. The Russian Procuracy General unwittingly substantiated Trepashkin’s claim. Of the four storage premises named (two bombed and two not), the Delo (case) states that the witnesses for three, V.A. Avseev, Mark Blumenfeld and N.A. Gollubeva are not reported to have identified Gochiyaev as False-Laipanov. It should be noted that Blumenfeld’s account was different to the statement that he had signed for the FSB. One witness, Yu.E. Petrunkin, did identify a photograph of Gochiyaev as the man known by him as Laipanov. A driver, V.P.Sinitsyn, hired by False-Laipanov to deliver sacks of sugar, was not reported to have made an identification. Another hired driver, A.V.Prushinskii, stated that he was paid for his work by a man in glasses, about 1.8m tall, similar to the composite photo of Laipanov. It should be noted that Prushinskii was not shown an actual photo of Gochiyaev, even though one existed (it had been shown to Petrunkin).<ref name="moscowbombings"/><br/> <br/>@@ -108,7 +108,7 @@\n<br/> <br/> {{cquote|Gochiyayev was from the Karachayevo-Cherkessia Republic, but he had been living in Moscow for more than ten years. All his family lived here. He had a construction company, Kapstroy 2000. If he wanted to organise the attacks, he wouldn’t have rented basements using the name of his firm. And he would have asked his family to leave the city for a safer place. For that reason, the more I investigated, the more I was sure that he didn’t organise the bombings. I sent an official request to the FSB to check the militia printouts and verify that Gochiyayev had really made those phone calls, but I found only obstacles on my way. I’m sure Gochiyayev had nothing to do with the attacks, but he was the ideal candidate: His liking for Wahhabi ideas was well-known. }}<br/> <br/>-Other researchers have criticized the theory, stating that it is a [[conspiracy theory]].

This was facilitated by a [[land reform]] introduced by Japanese Governor-General [[Terauchi Masatake]] which subsequently proved extremely unpopular with large segments of the Korean population. The Korean land ownership system was a complex system of absentee landlords, partial owner-tenants, and cultivators with traditional but without legal proof of ownership. Terauchi's new Land Survey Bureau conducted cadastral surveys that reestablished ownership by basis of written proof ([[deed]]s, titles, and similar documents). Ownership was denied to those who could not provide such written documentation (mostly lower class and partial owners, who had only traditional verbal "cultivator rights"). Although the plan succeeded in reforming land ownership/taxation structures, it added tremendously to the bitter and hostile environment of the time by enabling a huge amount of Korean land to be seized by the government and sold at [[subsidy|subsidized]] costs to any Japanese family willing to [[Settler|settle]] in Korea as part of a larger effort at [[colonization]].<ref name="Japan Focus"> {{cite web|url=http://www.japanfocus.org/products/details/2220 |title=Legal Categories, Demographic Change and Japan’s Korean Residents in the Long Twentieth Century |accessdate=2007-02-19 |last=Nozaki |first=Yoshiko |coauthors=Hiromitsu Inokuchi, Tae-young Kim }}</ref>.<br/>+<br/>+Japanese landlords included both individuals and corporations, such as the [[Oriental Development Company]].

They take turns [[insult]]ing; "burning", "capping", "cracking", "heating", "ranking", "sparking", "sunning", "janking", "snapping", "checking", "riding", "frying", "cooking", "jonein'", "cutting one up", "projectoring" or even "pwning/owning" (on online games) {{Fact|date=February 2007}} — on one another, their adversary's mother, or other family member until one of them has no [[comeback]]. In addition to any of the terms listed above, playing the dozens can also be referred to as a "cut-low fight," or simply an "insult fight."  Similar traditions exist in other [[Western world|Western cultures]].<br/>-<br/>-<div style="float: right; clear: right; width: 170px;">  <br/>-{{AfricanAmerican}}   <br/>-</div><br/>-<br/>-Each putdown, or ''snap'', ups the ante. Defeat can be humiliating, but a skilled contender, win or lose, may gain [[respect]]. The dozens is part of the African American oral tradition of wordplay and verbal sparring, elements evident in the [[Roots of hip hop music|development of hip-hop]], especially the practice of ''[[freestyle battle|freestyle battling]]''. Being defeated by an opponent is often referred to as ''being served''. Being served may cause a loss of street [[credibility|cred]] or credibility.<br/>-<br/>-==History and practice==<br/>-The dozens can be a harmless game of casual, good-natured jibes, an exchange of malicious insults, [[taunt]]s or, if tempers flare, a prelude to physical violence. While the competition usually seems light-hearted, smiles sometimes mask real tensions. In its purest form, the dozens is part of a custom of verbal sparring, of "[[wolf ticket|woofin']]" and "[[Signifying|signifyin']]" ostensibly intended to defuse conflict nonviolently, descended from oral traditions of indigenous West African cultures. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}<br/>-The contest is generally judged informally by any onlookers or bystanders who may be watching. The dozens is a battle for the respect of onlookers and is rarely seen without spectators. The onlookers express approval or disapproval with laughter, jeers, or slang filled catcalls such as, "Ohhhhh! Burn!."<br/>-<br/>-The term ''the dozens'' is believed to refer to the devaluing on the auction block of slaves who were past their prime, deformed, aged, or no longer capable of hard labor after years of back-breaking toil. These slaves often were sold by the dozen. In "Still Laughing to Keep from Crying: [[Black humor|Black Humor]]," African American author and professor Mona Lisa Saloy writes:<br/>-<br/>-<blockquote>The dozens has its origins in the slave trade of New Orleans where deformed slaves—generally slaves punished with dismemberment for disobedience—were grouped in lots of a 'cheap dozen' for sale to slave owners. For a Black to be sold as part of the 'dozens' was the lowest blow possible.<ref>{{cite web|author=Mona Lisa Saloy|year=2001|url=http://www.louisianafolklife.org/LT/Articles_Essays/still_laugh.html|title=Still Laughing to Keep from Crying: Black Humor|work=Louisiana Folklife Festival booklet|accessdate=2005-11-15}}</ref></blockquote><br/>-<br/>-"Yo' momma" is a common, widely recognized retort in slang. It is a cryptic and sometimes comical allusion to the dozens. A more extended version is the '''[[Yo Momma]] joke''', the most common way of playing the dozens, using a mix of exaggeration or even pop culture references to talk about the health, size, age, skin color, or sexual promiscuity of the opponent's mother (fathers and sisters are also popular targets, as well as the person they are insulting):<br/>-<br/>-::''Yo momma so fat, she jumped in the air and got stuck!''<br/>-::''Yo momma so dumb, she thought a [[quarterback]] was a refund!''<br/>-::''Yo momma so old, when God said: "Let there be light," she threw the switch!''<br/>-::''Yo momma's teeth is so yellow, [[I Can't Believe It's Not Butter]]!''<br/>-::''Yo momma so stupid, she got hit by a parked car!''<br/>-::''Yo momma so stupid, she died of hunger in a supermarket!''<br/>-::''Yo mamma so stupid, she put a quarter in a parking meter and said "Where's my gumball?"''<br/>-::''Yo momma so stupid, she stole a free sample.''<br/>-Children have been known to express contempt or defiance by reciting a short poem that refers to the dozens, but in which the insults are mostly implied:<br/>-<br/>-::Yo' momma, Yo' daddy, Yo' sista, too. Go tell them bitches, go back to the zoo.<br/>-<br/>-::Yo' momma, Yo' daddy, Yo' bald-head granny, Yo Grandma's Grandma's Cousin's Uncle Dog<br/>-<br/>-::Yo' momma, Yo' daddy, Yo' greasy-greasy granny, with the hole in her panty, goin' Beep-Beep-Beep down Sesame Street<br/>-<br/>-::Yo' momma, Yo' daddy, Yo' bald-head granny, she ninty one, she ninty two, she [[Sex|gettin down]] with [[Pikachu]]<br/>-<br/>-::She ninety-nine.

On page 241 of the paperback edition: "I looked at him, feeling a quick dislike and thinking, half in amusement, I don't play the dozens."  Ellison's correspondence with his friend, writer and fellow [[Tuskegee]] student, [[Albert Murray (writer)|Albert Murray]], is titled ''Trading Twelves'', which refers to competition among jazz musicians, who trade twelve bar solos, raising the ante each time.<br/>-<br/>-On the sitcom ''[[Benson (TV series)|Benson]]'' (episode unknown) Benson and Clayton compete in a formal 'Dozens' competition.<br/>-<br/>-[[Alternative hip-hop]] group [[The Pharcyde]] released a song on their debut album ''[[Bizarre Ride II: The Pharcyde]]'' entitled "Ya' Mama", the lyrics of which consist entirely of snaps. A remix of this song is used as the theme of MTV's trash-talk show ''[[Yo Momma]]'' (see below for more information about the show). The [[Australian hip-hop]] group [[Butterfingers]] have a song called "Yo Momma" that includes the chorus "Yo Momma's on the top of my things-to-do list." In addition, underground hip-hop artist [[Count Bass D]] begins his album [[Pre-Life Crisis]] with a song  about snaps called "The Dozens."<br/>-<br/>-The book ''Snaps'' (1994), written by James Percely, is a compendium of over 450 jokes. Its popularity gave rise to sequels ''Double Snaps'' (1995), ''Triple Snaps'' (1996), and ''Snaps 4'' (1998). The books use the epithet "your mother", as opposed to the more common "yo' momma". The book series spawned a television series titled ''Snaps'' which ran briefly on [[HBO]]. The movies ''[[White Men Can't Jump]]'', ''[[Remember the Titans]]'', ''[[8 Mile]]'', and ''[[House Party]]'' include exchanges of snaps.<br/>-<br/>-In a recurring ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' sketch from the [[1990s]] entitled "I'm Chillin'", which was presented as an inner-city public-access talk show, the host (played by then-castmember [[Chris Rock]]) would regularly present a segment entitled "Mother Joke of the Day".  Rock's character would present a "mother joke" submitted by a fictitious viewer, after which [[Don Pardo]] would describe a fictitious prize to be awarded to the viewer in question, including a beverage known as "F'd Up Malt Liquor".<br/>-<br/>-The [[Wayans Brothers|Keenan Ivory Wayans]] TV show ''[[In Living Color]]'' regularly featured a game show segment titled ''The Dirty Dozens'' and parodies of popular game shows, such as ''[[Wheel of Fortune (US game show)|Wheel of Dozens]]'' and ''[[Family Feud|Family Dozens]]''.  Their brothers, Shawn and Marlon, have also been involved in these, so much so that in 2004, they released a mobile phone game based on ''The Dozens'', as well as a card game.<br/>-<br/>-The book ''A Portrait of Yo Mama As a Young Man'' (2005), written by Andrew Barlow and Kent Roberts, is a [[postmodernism|postmodern]] take on the dozens which redefines the form through the use of reflexivity, absurdism, and anti-humor. In addition to jokes, the book contains charts, poetry, a résumé, and various other short humor pieces. The title is derived from [[James Joyce|James Joyce's]] ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]''.<br/>-<br/>-The title of the [[Mexico|Mexican]] film ''[[Y tu mamá también]]'' (literally, "And your mother, too") is taken from a scene in the movie where in the two young male protagonists do their equivalent of the dozens.<br/>-<br/>-In 2006, [[MTV]] premiered a [[game show]] titled ''[[Yo Momma]]'' [[executive producer|executive produced]] and [[game show host|hosted]] by [[Wilmer Valderrama]]. Contestants face off in playing the dozens. The person judged to be the funniest wins a cash prize. The four winners from that week then face off in a final round, where the weekly winner gets another cash prize and additional prizes as well.<br/>-<br/>-In the TV series, ''The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy'', Grim's scythe turns Billy and Mandy's school principal, Principal Goodvibes, into a semi-rapper; he insults Grim's momma once, and is seen having a dozens competition with Erwin that Goodvibes loses badly. Then the grandmother steps in and plays the dozens with the principal, who loses again.<br/>-<br/>-Fictional artist [[MC Hawking]] (a gangsta-rapping parody of theoretical physicist [[Stephen Hawking]]) has a song called "The Dozens" on his CD ''A Brief History of Rhyme: MC Hawking's Greatest Hits'', where he raps "yo momma" jokes like "Yo momma's such a slut, the other night I had to park my dick on her ass and wait an hour to get in."<br/>-<br/>-Award-winning author and [[University of California, Los Angeles]] professor Mike Rose refers to "running the dozens" in his oft-anthologized essay, "I Just Wanna Be Average". ("Tyrrell was the coolest kid I knew. He ran the dozens like a metric halfback...")<br/>-<br/>-In jazz, at least three pieces have dozens-related titles: "Yo' Mama's Mambo" which pianist/composer [[Horace Silver]] plays; "How's Your Mama" which alto saxophonist/composer [[Phil Woods]] plays as his theme song; and "Yo Mama", a blues which trumpeter [[Jack Sheldon]] usually sandwiches between his own versions of the dozens.<br/>-<br/>-In the 2001 film ''[[Heist (film)|Heist]]'', written and directed by [[David Mamet]], [[Gene Hackman]]'s character Joe Moore assaults an adversary and subsequently asks him, "You want to play the dozens? Huh? Here we go. There was an error at the hospital, you died at birth, your turn."<br/>-<br/>-== The dozens in other cultures ==<br/>-<br/>-Historically, similar verbal competitions were practiced in other cultures. Ancient Germanic cultures, including the Norse and Anglo-Saxons, practiced a ritual exchange of insults known as [[flyting]], which is similar in function to the dozens. In sixteenth-century [[Scotland]], the term flyting was used to describe an exchange of abusive poems by poets. [[Arab]] poets exchanged creative insults in ''naqa'id'', a practice continued in the ''zajal'' verbal jousting of present-day [[Lebanon]].  American [[cowboy]]s in the late nineteenth century participated in '''cussing contests''', the winners of which were sometimes rewarded with new saddles.<br/>-<br/>-In Shakespeare's England insult competitions were common, with professional experts who were known as 'roarers'. Ben Jonson (a contemporary of Shakespeare) wrote a comedy, 'The Roarer', about a foppish young man who hires a roarer to teach him the art so that he can best his wife-to-be in arguments. Some aspects of insults are discussed in the essay 'Lars Porsena, or the Future of Swearing in the English Language' by the English poet Robert Graves.<br/>-<br/>-Outside of insult contests, the phrase "[[Mother insult|your mom]]" is also used as a serious insult or general retort.<br/>-<br/>-==References==<br/>-<br/>-<references /><br/>-<br/>-==See also==<br/>-{{Wiktionarypar|Your

origins of Down syndrome}}<br/>+[[Image:Down_Syndrome_Karyotype.png|right|thumb|[[Karyotype]] for trisomy Down syndrome. Notice the three copies of chromosome 21.]]<br/>+Down syndrome is a chromosomal abnormality characterized by the presence of an extra copy of genetic material on the [[Chromosome 21 (human)|21st chromosome]], either in whole ([[Aneuploidy#Trisomy|trisomy]] [[Chromosome 21 (human)|21]]) or part (such as due to [[Chromosomal translocation|translocations]]). The effects of the extra copy vary greatly among individuals, depending on the extent of the extra copy, genetic background, environmental factors, and random chance. Down syndrome occurs in all human populations, and analogous effects have been found in other species such as chimpanzees<ref>McClure HM, Belden KH, Pieper WA, Jacobson CB. Autosomal trisomy in a chimpanzee: resemblance to Down's syndrome. ''Science.'' 1969 Sep 5;165(897):1010-2. PMID 4240970</ref> and mice. Recently, researchers have created [[transgenic]] mice with most of human chromosome 21 (in addition to the normal mouse chromosomes).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4268226.stm |title=Down's syndrome recreated in mice| publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2006-06-14 |date=2005-09-22}}</ref> The extra chromosomal material can come about in several distinct ways. A normal human karyotype is designated as 46,XX or 46,XY, indicating 46 chromosomes with an XX arrangement for females and 46 chromosomes with an XY arrangement for males.<ref>For a description of human karyotype see {{cite web |author=Mittleman, A. (editor) |year=1995 |url=http://www.iscn1995.org/ |title=An International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomeclature |accessdate=2006-06-04}}</ref><br/>+<br/>+===Trisomy 21===<br/>+Trisomy 21 (47,XX,+21) is caused by a [[Meiosis|meiotic]] [[nondisjunction]] event. With nondisjunction, a [[gamete]] (''i.e.'', a sperm or egg cell) is produced with an extra copy of chromosome 21; the gamete thus has 24 chromosomes. When combined with a normal gamete from the other parent, the embryo now has 47 chromosomes, with three copies of chromosome 21. Trisomy 21 is the cause of approximately 95% of observed Down syndromes, with 88% coming from nondisjunction in the maternal gamete and 8% coming from nondisjunction in the paternal gamete.<ref name="occurrence">{{cite web |url=http://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/pubs/downsyndrome.cfm#TheOccurrence |title=Down syndrome occurrence rates (NIH) |accessdate=2006-06-02}}</ref> <br/>+<br/>+===Mosaicism===<br/>+Trisomy 21 is generally caused prior to conception, and all cells in the body are affected. However, when some of the cells in the body are normal and other cells have trisomy 21, it is called [[Mosaic (genetics)|Mosaic]] Down Syndrome (46,XX/47,XX,+21).<ref>[http://www.mosaicdownsyndrome.com Mosaic Down Syndrome on the Web]</ref> This can occur in one of two ways: A [[nondisjunction]] event during an early cell division in a normal embryo leads to a fraction of the cells with trisomy 21; or a Down syndrome embryo undergoes [[nondisjunction]] and some of the cells in the embryo revert back to the normal chromosomal arrangement. There is considerable variability in the fraction of trisomy 21, both as a whole and among tissues. This is the cause of 1–2% of the observed Down syndromes.<ref name="occurrence" /><br/>+<br/>+===Robertsonian translocation===<br/>+The extra chromosome 21 material that causes Down syndrome may be due to a [[Robertsonian translocation]]. In this case, the long arm of [[Chromosome 21 (human)|chromosome 21]] is attached to another chromosome, often [[Chromosome 14 (human)|chromosome 14]] (45,XX,t(14;21q)) or itself (called an [[isochromosome]], 45,XX,t(21q;21q)). Normal [[disjunction]] leading to gametes have a significant chance of creating a gamete with an extra chromosome 21. Translocation Down syndrome is often referred to as ''familial Down syndrome''. It is the cause of 2-3% of observed cases of Down syndrome.<ref name="occurrence" /> It does not show the maternal age effect, and is just as likely to have come from fathers as mothers.<br/>+<br/>+===Duplication of a portion of chromosome 21===<br/>+Rarely, a region of chromosome 21 will undergo a duplication event. This will lead to extra copies of some, but not all, of the genes on chromosome 21 (46,XX,dup(21q)).<ref>Petersen MB, Tranebjaerg L, McCormick MK, Michelsen N, Mikkelsen M, Antonarakis SE. ''Clinical, cytogenetic, and molecular genetic characterization of two unrelated patients with different duplications of 21q.'' Am J Med Genet Suppl. 1990;7:104-9.<br/>+PMID 2149934</ref> If the duplicated region has genes that are responsible for Down syndrome physical and mental characteristics, such individuals will show those characteristics.

'''Meconium''' historically referred to related, weaker preparations made from other parts of the poppy or different species of poppies.  Modern opium production is the culmination of millennia of production, in which the source poppy, methods of extraction and processing, and methods of consumption have become increasingly potent. <br/>-<br/>-Cultivation of opium poppies for food, [[anaesthesia]], and ritual purposes dates back at least to [[Neolithic]] Europe.  The [[Sumerian]], [[Assyrian]], [[Egyptian]], [[Minoan]], [[Greek]], [[Roman]], and [[Arabic]] Empires each made widespread use of opium, which was the most potent form of [[pain relief]], allowing ancient surgeons to perform prolonged surgical procedures.  Opium is mentioned in the most important medical texts of the ancient world, including the [[Ebers Papyrus]] and the writings of [[Dioscorides]], [[Galen]], and [[Avicenna]].<br/>-<br/>-Recreational use of the drug began in a sexual context in China in the fifteenth century, but was limited by its rarity and expense.  Opium trade became more regular by the seventeenth century, when it was mixed with tobacco for smoking, and addiction was first recognized.  Opium prohibition in China began in 1729, and was followed by a century of exponentially increasing opium use.  British smugglers favored opium as a product cheaply obtained from Indian provinces under British exploitation, which was highly valued and in demand in China.  A massive confiscation of opium by the Chinese led to the first of two [[Opium Wars]] in 1838 and 1860, which won Britain the right to trade opium to every part of China, until more than a quarter of the male population was addicted by 1905.  Recreational or addictive opium use in other nations remained rare into the late nineteenth century, recorded by an ambivalent literature that often praised the drug.<br/>-<br/>-Global regulation of opium began with the stigmatization of Chinese and Indian immigrants and [[opium dens]], leading rapidly from town ordinances in the 1870s to the formation of the [[International Opium Commission]] in 1909.  During this period the portrayal of opium in literature became squalid and violent, British opium trade was largely supplanted by domestic Chinese production, purified [[morphine]] and [[heroin]] became widely available for injection, and [[patent medicines]] containing opiates reached a peak of popularity.  Opium was prohibited in many countries during the early twentieth century, leading to the modern pattern of opium production as a precursor for illegal recreational drugs or tightly regulated legal prescription drugs.  Illicit opium production, now dominated by Afghanistan, has increased steadily in recent years to over 6600 tons yearly.<br/>+'''Opium''' is a [[narcotic]] resin produced from [[Opium poppy|opium poppies]] ''([[Papaver]] somniferum)''.

Reynolds’ precociousness did not, however, lead to poetic success to the degree of his peers. Reynolds’ literary fame is largely dependent on his close friendship with Keats, with whom he was on intimate terms for a few years. Later he became close friends with [[Thomas Hood]] with whom he worked on the London Magazine. With Hood Reynolds published the Odes and Addresses to Great People in 1825. The book was reviewed by Charles Lamb and mistakenly thought to have been written by him by a number  of people including Coleridge.<ref>Claude page 286</ref> Lamb wrote a letter to Coleridge on July 2nd of 1825 confessing that he had not written the book.<br/>-   <br/>-Though Reynolds wrote numerous essay contributions to a number of London periodicals, he failed to gain any significant success and largely gave up literature for the practice of law. In this field Reynolds was similarly unlucky when the law firm in which he worked folded. Later in life he worked as a clerk in the Isle of Wight. <br/>+'''John Hamilton Reynolds''' (1794 -1852) was an English poet, satirist, critic, and playwright.

At that time, heated discussions were continually held in political circles on the issue as to whether such a poor state as the Grand Duchy of [[Hessen]] could afford a technically oriented higher educational institution, or even a polytechnic. After the foundation of the '''TH Darmstadt''' in 1877, student numbers kept on being so low that in the years from 1881 to 1882 there were long debates in public about closing down the University. In this difficult situation, the local government and the University made the courageous decision to set up the first chair of [[electrical engineering]] worldwide. Thus the School of Electrical Engineering came into being as the sixth faculty of the TH Darmstadt, which was a novelty in academia, because until then no other polytechnic or university had had its own Faculty of Electrical Engineering. This forward-looking higher education policy paved the way for Darmstadt to take up a leading position in the rapidly developing field of Electrical Engineering, which in turn led to a continuously rising number of students, so that the closure of the TH Darmstadt never was demanded again.</td>

A typical blog combines text, images, and links to other blogs, web pages, and other media related to its topic. Most blogs are primarily textual although some focus on [[photograph]]s ([[photoblog]]), [[video]]s ([[vlog]]), or [[audio]] ([[podcasting]]), and are part of a wider network of [[social media]].<br/>-<br/>-The word ''blog'' can also be used as a verb, meaning ''to maintain or add content to a blog.''<br/>-<br/>-== History ==<br/>-[[Chronicle]]s, [[commonplace]]s, [[personal journal|diaries]], and [[perzine]]s can all be seen as predecessors of blogs.<br/>-<br/>-Before blogging became popular, digital communities took many forms, including [[Usenet]], [[electronic mailing list|e-mail lists]] and [[bulletin board system]]s (BBS). In the 1990s, [[Internet forum]] software, such as [[WebEx]], created running conversations with "threads". Threads are topical connections between messages on a metaphorical "corkboard".<br/>-<br/>-=== 1994 – 2001 ===<br/>-{{Main|Online diary}}<br/>-[[Image:Brad Fitzpatrick.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Brad Fitzpatrick]], an early blogger.]]<br/>-The modern blog evolved from the [[online diary]] where people would keep a running account of their personal lives. Most such writers called themselves diarists, [[journalist]]s, or journalers. A few called themselves [[escribitionist]]s. The Open Pages [[webring]] included members of the online-journal community. [[Justin Hall]], who began eleven years of personal blogging in 1994 while a student at [[Swarthmore College]], is generally recognized as one of the earliest bloggers.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/02/20/MNGBKBEJO01.DTL|title=Time to get a life — pioneer blogger Justin Hall bows out at 31|publisher=SFgate|date=2005-02-20|accessdate=2006-06-09}}</ref><br/>-<br/>-Other forms of journals kept online also existed. A notable example was game programmer [[John Carmack|John Carmack's]] widely read journal, published via the [[finger protocol]]. Websites, including both corporate sites and [[personal homepage]]s, had and still often have "What's New" or "News" sections, often on the [[home page|index page]] and sorted by date. One example of a news based "weblog" is the [http://drudgereport.com/ "Drudge Report"] founded by the self styled maverick reporter [[Matt Drudge]], though apparently Drudge dislikes this classification. One noteworthy early precursor to a blog was the [[tongue-in-cheek]] personal website that was frequently updated by [[Usenet]] legend [[Kibo]].<br/>-<br/>-Early weblogs were simply manually updated components of common [[website]]s. However, the evolution of tools to facilitate the production and maintenance of web articles posted in said chronological fashion made the publishing process feasible to a much larger, less technical, population. Ultimately, this resulted in the distinct class of online publishing that produces blogs we recognize today. For instance, the use of some sort of browser-based software is now a typical aspect of "blogging". blogs can be hosted by dedicated [[blog hosting service]]s, or they can be run using [[blog software]], such as [[blogger (service)|blogger]] or [[LiveJournal]], or on regular [[web hosting service]]s, such as [[DreamHost]].<br/>-<br/>-The term "weblog" was coined by [[Jorn Barger]] on [[17 December]] [[1997]]. The short form, "blog," was coined by Peter Merholz, who jokingly broke the word ''weblog'' into the phrase ''we blog'' in the sidebar of his blog Peterme.com in April or May of 1999.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/surveys/displaystory.cfm?story_id=6794172|title=It's the links, stupid|publisher=[[The Economist]]|date=2006-4-20|accessdate=2006-07-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/19991013021124/http://peterme.com/index.html|title=Peterme.com|author=Peter Merholz|publisher=[[The Internet Archive]]|date=1999|accessdate=2006-07-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kottke.org/03/08/its-weblog-not-web-log|author=[[Jason Kottke]]|title=kottke.org|date=August 26, 2003|accessdate=2006-07-21}}</ref> This was quickly adopted as both a noun and verb ("to blog," meaning "to edit one's weblog or to post to one's weblog").<br/>-<br/>-After a slow start, blogging rapidly gained in popularity: the site [[Xanga]], launched in 1996, had only 100 diaries by 1997, but over 50,000,000 as of December 2005. Blog usage spread during 1999 and the years following, being further popularized by the near-simultaneous arrival of the first hosted blog tools:<br/>-* [[Open Diary]] launched in October 1998, soon growing to thousands of online diaries. Open Diary innovated the reader comment, becoming the first blog community where readers could add comments to other writers' blog entries.<br/>-* [[Brad Fitzpatrick]] started [[LiveJournal]] in March 1999.<br/>-* Andrew Smales created [[Pitas.com]] in July 1999 as an easier alternative to maintaining a "news page" on a website, followed by [[Diaryland]] in September 1999, focusing more on a personal diary community.<ref>Jensen, Mallory [http://www.cjr.org/issues/2003/5/blog-jensen.asp?printerfriendly=yes A Brief History of Weblogs]</ref><br/>-* [[Evan Williams (blogger)|Evan Williams]] and [[Meg Hourihan]] ([[Pyra Labs]]) launched [[blogger.com]] in August 1999 (purchased by [[Google]] in February 2003)<br/>-<!-- * Paul Kedrosky's [[GrokSoup]] -- EXPAND OR DELETE? --><br/>-<br/>-Blogging combined the personal web page with tools to make linking to other pages easier &mdash; specifically [[permalink]]s, [[blogroll]]s and [[TrackBack]]s. This, together with [[List of search engines#blog search engines|weblog search engines]] enabled bloggers to track the threads that connected them to others with similar interests.<br/>-<br/>-=== 2001 – 2004 ===<br/>-Several broadly popular American blogs emerged in 2001: [[Andrew Sullivan]]'s AndrewSullivan.com, [[Ron Gunzburger]]'s [[Politics1.com]], Taegan Goddard's [[Political Wire]] and [[Jerome Armstrong]]'s [[MyDD]] — all blogging primarily on [[political blog|politics]] (two earlier popular American political blogs were Bob Somerby's [[Daily Howler]] launched in 1998 and [[Mickey Kaus]]' Kausfiles launched in 1999).<br/>-<br/>-By 2001, blogging was enough of a phenomenon that how-to manuals began to appear, primarily focusing on technique. The importance of the blogging community (and its relationship to larger society) increased rapidly. Established schools of [[journalism]] began researching blogging and noting the differences between journalism and blogging.<br/>-<br/>-In 2002, Jerome Armstrong's friend and sometime [[business]] partner [[Markos Moulitsas Zúniga]] began [[Daily Kos|DailyKos]]. With up to a million visits a day during peak events, it has now become one of the Internet's most trafficked blogs.<br/>-<br/>-Also in 2002, many blogs focused on comments by [[United States Senate Majority Leader|U.S. Senate Majority Leader]] [[Trent Lott]]. Senator Lott, at a party honoring [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Strom Thurmond]], praised Senator Thurmond by suggesting that the United States would have been better off had Thurmond been elected president. Lott's critics saw these comments as a tacit approval of [[racial segregation]], a policy advocated by Thurmond's [[U.S. presidential election, 1948|1948 presidential campaign]]. This view was reinforced by documents and recorded interviews dug up by bloggers. (See [[Josh Marshall]]'s ''[[Talking Points Memo]]''.) Though Lott's comments were made at a public event attended by the media, no major media organizations reported on his controversial comments until after blogs broke the story.  Blogging helped to create a political crisis that forced Lott to step down as majority leader.<br/>-<br/>-The impact of this story gave greater credibility to blogs as a medium of news dissemination. Though often seen as partisan gossips, bloggers sometimes lead the way in bringing key information to public light, with mainstream media having to follow their lead. More often, however, news blogs tend to react to material already published by the mainstream media.<br/>-<br/>-Since 2002, blogs have gained increasing notice and coverage for their role in breaking, shaping, and [[Spin (public relations)|spinning]] [[news]] stories. The [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq war]] saw bloggers taking measured and passionate points of view that go beyond the traditional [[left-right politics|left-right]] divide of the [[political spectrum]].<br/>-<br/>-Blogging by established politicians and political candidates, to express opinions on war and other issues, cemented blogs' role as a news source. (See [[Howard Dean]] and [[Wesley Clark]].) Meanwhile, an increasing number of experts blogged, making blogs a source of in-depth analysis. (See Daniel Drezner and [[J. Bradford DeLong]].)<br/>-<br/>-The second Iraq war was the first "blog war" in another way: Iraqi bloggers gained wide readership, and one, [[Salam Pax]], published a book of his blog. Blogs were also created by soldiers serving in the Iraq war. Such "[[warblog]]" gave readers new perspectives on the realities of war, as well as often offering different viewpoints from those of official news sources.<br/>-<br/>-Blogging was used to draw attention to obscure news sources. For example, bloggers posted links to traffic cameras in Madrid as a huge anti-terrorism demonstration filled the streets in the wake of the [[11 March 2004 Madrid attacks|March 11 attacks]].<br/>-<br/>-Bloggers began to provide nearly-instant commentary on televised events, creating a secondary meaning of the word "blogging": to simultaneously transcribe and [[Editorial|editorialize]] speeches and events shown on television. (For example, "I am blogging Rice's testimony" means "I am posting my reactions to [[Condoleezza Rice|Condoleezza Rice's]] testimony into my blog as I watch her on television.") Real-time commentary is sometimes referred to as "liveblogging."<br/>-<br/>-=== 2004 – present ===<br/>-[[Image:Wordpress main theme.png|thumb|300px|A [[WordPress]] test blog running [[Kubrick (Wordpress theme)|Kubrick]].]]<br/>-In 2004, the role of blogs became increasingly mainstream, as [[political consultant]]s, news services and candidates began using them as tools for outreach and opinion forming. Even politicians not actively campaigning, such as the [[Labour Party (UK)|UK's Labour Party's]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Tom Watson (politician)|Tom Watson]], began to blog to bond with constituents.<br/>-<br/>-[[Minnesota Public Radio]] broadcast a program by [[Christopher Lydon]] and [[Matt Stoller]] called "The blogging of the President," which covered a transformation in politics that blogging seemed to presage. The ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'' began regular coverage of blogs and blogging. Anthologies of blog pieces reached print, and blogging personalities began appearing on radio and television. In the summer of 2004, both United States [[Democratic National Convention|Democratic]] and [[Republican National Convention|Republican]] Parties' conventions credentialed bloggers, and blogs became a standard part of the publicity arsenal. Mainstream television programs, such as [[Chris Matthews]]' ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews|Hardball]]'', formed their own blogs. [[Merriam-Webster]]'s Dictionary declared "blog" as the word of the year in 2004.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/blog_declared_Word_of_the_Year Wikinews|publisher=Wikinews|title=blog declared Word of the Year|date=2004-12-01|accessdate=2006-06-22}}</ref><br/>-<br/>-Blogs were among the driving forces behind the "[[Rathergate]]" scandal, to wit: (television journalist) Dan Rather presented documents (on the CBS show ''[[60 Minutes]]'') that conflicted with accepted accounts of [[President Bush's military service]] record. Bloggers declared the documents to be [[forgery|forgeries]] and presented evidence and arguments in support of that view, and CBS apologized for what it said were inadequate reporting techniques (see [[Little Green Footballs]]). Many bloggers view this scandal as the advent of blogs' acceptance by the mass media, both as a source of news and opinion and as means of applying political pressure.<br/>-<br/>-Some bloggers have moved over to other media. The following bloggers (and others) have appeared on radio and television: [[Atrios|Duncan Black]] (known widely by his pseudonym, Atrios), [[Glenn Reynolds]] ([[Instapundit]]) , [[Markos Moulitsas Zúniga]] ([[Daily Kos]]), [[Alex Steffen]] ([[Worldchanging]]) and [[Ana Marie Cox]] ([[Wonkette]]). [[Hugh Hewitt]] is an example of a media personality who has moved in the other direction, adding to his reach in "old media" by being an influential blogger.<br/>-<br/>-Some blogs were an important source of news during the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|December 2004 Tsunami]] such as [[Medecins Sans Frontieres]], which used SMS text messaging to report from affected areas in Sri Lanka and Southern India.<br/>-<br/>-In the [[United Kingdom]], ''[[The Guardian]]'' [[newspaper]] launched a redesign in September 2005, which included a daily digest of blogs on page 2. Also in June 2006, [[BBC News]] launched a weblog for its editors, following other news companies <ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/5116654.stm|title=Down with blogs... so here's another|first=Dawn|last=Wilson|date=2006-06-26|accessdate=2006-06-26|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref>.<br/>-<br/>-In January 2005, ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine listed eight bloggers that business people "could not ignore": [[Engadget|Peter Rojas]], [[Xeni Jardin]], [[Ben Trott]], [[Mena Trott]], [[Jonathan I.

Technorati provides current information on both popular searches and [[tag]]s used to categorize blog postings.<br/>-<br/>-== Business models ==<br/>-{{unsourced}}<br/>-While the great majority of blogs are non-commercial, full-time bloggers have struggled to find a way to make a profit from their work. The most common and simplest method is to accept targeted [[web banner|banner advertising]]. However, some bloggers have been hesitant to use this because of negative reader response to the ads. A more discreet form of advertising is for bloggers to promote merchandise from other sites, receiving a commission when a customer buys the item after following a blog link.<br/>-<br/>-Others have tried a [[click-to-donate]] model. Prominent political blogger [[Andrew Sullivan]] claimed at one point that accepting voluntary donations to his blog was more lucrative than his magazine work for [[The New Republic]]. Following the practice of public television, Sullivan boosted donations with periodic "[[pledge drives]]," one of which was reported to net him $120,000. Sullivan's attempt at securing corporate sponsorship for his blog fell apart after strong negative reader response to the deal.<br/>-<br/>-No other high-profile blogger has accepted a single corporate sponsor since Sullivan's failed deal. However, In the early twenty-first century, many magazines and newspapers began sponsoring personal blogs by their employees. The business model in this case is essentially the same as that of a traditional newspaper columnist. In a creative extension of the model, employees at other media companies began blogs focusing on the companies' products. For example, many actors in pornography blog about their work on company sites, creating a sense of personal connection between consumer and product.<br/>-<br/>-== Anatomy of a blog entry ==<br/>-[[Image:Typical blog.png|thumb|250px|A [[screenshot]] of a typical blog.]]<br/>-A variety of different systems are used to create and maintain blogs. Dedicated [[web application]]s can eliminate the need for bloggers to manage this software. With web interfaces, these systems allow travelers to blog from anywhere on the Internet, and allow users to create blogs without having to maintain their own server. Such systems allow users to work with tools such as Ecto, Elicit and [[Blogger (service)|Blogger]] which allow users to maintain their Web-hosted blog without the need to be online while composing or editing posts. Blog creation tools and blog hosting are also provided by some Web hosting companies ([[Tripod]]), Internet service providers ([[America Online]]), online publications ([[Salon.com]]) and internet portals ([[Yahoo! 360°]] or [[Google]]). Some advanced users have developed custom blogging systems from scratch using [[Server-side scripting|server-side]] software, and often implement membership management and password protected areas. Others have created a mix of a blog and wiki, called a [[bliki]].<br/>-<br/>-A blog entry typically consists of the following:<br/>-* ''Title'', the main title, or headline, of the post.<br/>-* ''Body'', main content of the post.<br/>-* ''[[Permalink]]'', the [[URL]] of the full, individual article.<br/>-* ''Post Date'', date and time the post was published.<br/>-<br/>-A blog entry optionally includes the following:<br/>-* ''Comments''<br/>-* ''Categories'' (or [[tag]]s) - subjects that the entry discusses<br/>-* ''[[Trackback]]'' and or ''[[pingback]]'' - links to other sites that refer to the entry<br/>-<br/>-=== Comments ===<br/>-{{main|Feedback comment system}}<br/>-<br/>-Comments are a way to provide discussion on blog entries. Readers can leave a [[comment]] on a post, which can correct errors or contain their opinion on the post or the post's subject. Services like [[coComment]] aim to ease discussion through comments, by allowing tracking of them.<br/>-<br/>-== Blog popularity ==<br/>-Recently, researchers have analyzed the dynamics of how blogs become popular. There are essentially two measures of this: popularity through citations, as well as popularity through affiliation (i.e. [[blogroll]]). The basic conclusion from studies of the structure of blogs is that while it takes time for a blog to become popular through blogrolls, permalinks can boost popularity more quickly, and are perhaps more indicative of popularity and authority than blogrolls, since they denote that people are actually reading the blog's content and deem it valuable or noteworthy in specific cases.<ref>Marlow, C.

It gathered this information for over 4 years, and autonomously tracked the most contagious information spreading in the blog community. The project is no longer active.<br/>-<br/>-Blogs are also given rankings by [[Technorati]] based on the amount of incoming links and [[Alexa Internet]] based on the web hits of Alexa Toolbar users.  In August 2006, Technorati listed the most linked-to blog as that of Chinese actress [[Xu Jinglei]] and the most-read blog as group-written [[Boing Boing]].<ref>Fickling, David, [http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/news/archives/2006/08/15/internet_killed_the_tv_star.html Internet killed the TV star], [[The Guardian]] NewsBlog, [[15 August]] [[2006]]</ref><br/>-<br/>-It was reported by Chinese media [[Xinhua]] that the blog of [[Xu Jinglei]] received more than 50 million page views, claiming to be the most popular blog in the world.<ref>[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-08/24/content_672747.htm]</ref>  In mid-2006, it also had the most incoming links of any blogs on the Internet.<ref>[http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/news/archives/2006/08/15/internet_killed_the_tv_star.html]</ref><br/>-<br/>-==Blogging and the mass media==<br/>-Many bloggers differentiate themselves from the [[mainstream media]], while others are members of that media working through a different channel. Some institutions see blogging as a means of "getting around the filter" and pushing [[messages]] directly to the public. Some critics worry that bloggers respect neither [[copyright]] nor the role of the [[mass media]] in presenting society with credible news.<br/>-<br/>-Bloggers' credibility problem, however, can be an advantage for the bloggers and for the mainstream journalists who take an interest in them. News organizations are sometimes reluctant to tell stories that will upset important people. But when bloggers or activists make sensational claims, then they become stories themselves, and journalists can use them as cover for reporting the underlying scandals.<br/>-<br/>-Many mainstream journalists, meanwhile, write their own blogs -- well over 300, according to CyberJournalist.net's J-blog list. The first known use of a Weblog on a news site was in August 1998, when [[Jonathan Dube]] of The [[Charlotte Observer]] published one chronicling Hurricane Bonnie.<ref>{{cite news|title=blogging Bonnie.|work=Poynter.org|date=18 September, 2003 |url=http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=52&aid=48413/}}</ref><br/>-<br/>-Blogs have also had an influence on [[minority language]]s, bringing together scattered speakers and learners; this is particularly so with blogs in [[Goidelic language|Gaelic languages]], whose creators can be found as far away from traditional Gaelic areas as [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Alaska]]. Minority language publishing (which may lack economic feasibility) can find its audience through inexpensive blogging.<br/>-<br/>-== Legal issues ==<br/>-The emergence of blogging has brought a range of legal liabilities. Employers have "[[dooce]]d" (fired) employees who maintain personal blogs that discuss their employers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/11/03/airline_blogger_sacked/|title=Queen of the Sky gets marching orders|publisher=The Register|date=2004-11-03|accessdate=2006-06-23}}</ref> The major areas of concern are the issues of proprietary or confidential information, and defamation. Several cases have been brought before the national courts against bloggers and the courts have returned with mixed verdicts. In ''John Doe v. Patrick Cahill'', the [[Delaware Supreme Court]] held that stringent standards had to be met to unmask anonymous bloggers, and also took the unusual step of dismissing the libel case itself (as unfounded under American libel law) rather than referring it back to the [[trial court]] for reconsideration. In a bizarre twist, the Cahills were able to find the ISP address of John Doe, who turned out to be the person they suspected: the town's mayor, Councilman Cahill's political rival.

This was facilitated by a [[land reform]] introduced by Japanese Governor-General [[Terauchi Masatake]] which subsequently proved extremely unpopular with large segments of the Korean population. The Korean land ownership system was a complex system of absentee landlords, partial owner-tenants, and cultivators with traditional but without legal proof of ownership. Terauchi's new Land Survey Bureau conducted cadastral surveys that reestablished ownership by basis of written proof ([[deed]]s, titles, and similar documents). Ownership was denied to those who could not provide such written documentation (mostly lower class and partial owners, who had only traditional verbal "cultivator rights"). Although the plan succeeded in reforming land ownership/taxation structures, it added tremendously to the bitter and hostile environment of the time by enabling a huge amount of Korean land to be seized by the government and sold at [[subsidy|subsidized]] costs to any Japanese family willing to [[Settler|settle]] in Korea as part of a larger effort at [[colonization]].<ref name="Japan Focus"> {{cite web|url=http://www.japanfocus.org/products/details/2220 |title=Legal Categories, Demographic Change and Japan’s Korean Residents in the Long Twentieth Century |accessdate=2007-02-19 |last=Nozaki |first=Yoshiko |coauthors=Hiromitsu Inokuchi, Tae-young Kim }}</ref>.<br/>+<br/>+Japanese landlords included both individuals and corporations, such as the [[Oriental Development Company]].

These may be referred to as fuel bungs.<br/>-<br/>-The most common every-day example of a bung is the [[stopper (plug)|stopper]] of a [[wine bottle]].

Other bungs, particularly those used in chemical barrels, may be made of metal and are screwed into place via threading.<br/>-<br/>-==Rubber bungs==<br/>-In [[chemistry]], bungs are usually made of hardened rubber. Some chemistry bungs may also include one or more holes so a [[glass tube]] or [[laboratory funnel]] may be inserted through the bung and into the container or another piece of apparatus. The rubber bung may be used to seal a flask because the user may require the contents to be mixed via shaking the flask or may require that the contents be kept inside the flask and prevented from leaking out. In all cases, the bung keeps the experimentation environment completely sealed so that [[liquids]] or [[gases]] cannot escape.<br/>-<br/>-Apart from self-made glassware, rubber bungs are rarely used now. They have been supplanted by [[laboratory glassware]] which come with standard [[ground glass joint]]s which allow the pieces to be fitted together easily. Ground glass joints are also much more resistant to solvents and chemicals used.<br/>-<br/>-Plastic bungs are commonly used to stop the air leaking from the lower parts of an air-bed. This type of bung is commonly made in two parts; the plastic outer screw on cap and the inner rubber bung used to seal the hole.<br/>+[[Ground glass joint|Ground glass stoppers]] and rubber stoppers are commonly used with laboratory glassware, mainly because of their nonreactivity. Some stoppers used in labs have holes in them to allow the insertion of glass or rubber tubing. This is often used when a reaction is taking place in the flask or test tube and the byproduct or result of the reaction is desired to be collected. For instance, if one were to boil water in a test tube in an attempt to collect the water vapor, one can seal the test tube with a stopper with holes in it. Upon inserting tubing into the hole(s) and exposing the tube to heat, the water vapor will rise through the hole, make its way through the tubing, and into the collection chamber of choice. The water vapor would not be able to escape into the air, because the stopper and the tubing, if set up correctly, should be airtight.<br/> <br/> ==See also==<br/>-* [[Bunghole]]<br/> * [[Closure (container)]]<br/> <br/>-==References==<br/>-{{Reflist}}<br/>+{{DEFAULTSORT:Stopper (Plug)}}<br/>+[[Category:Laboratory equipment]]<br/>+[[Category:Containers]]<br/>+[[Category:Wine packaging and storage]]<br/>+[[Category:Seals (mechanical)]]<br/> <br/>-{{Laboratory equipment}}<br/>-<br/>-[[Category:Laboratory equipment]]<br/>-[[Category:Seals (mechanical)]]<br/>-[[Category:Containers]]<br/>-<br/>-[[de:Spund]]<br/>-[[es:Tapón]]<br/>+[[ca:Tap de suro]]<br/>+[[de:Korken]]<br/>+[[es:Tapón de corcho]]<br/>+[[fr:Bouchon à vin]]<br/> [[gl:Rolla]]<br/>+[[nl:Kurk (stop)]]<br/> [[new:बुङ]]<br/>+[[pl:Korek]]<br/>+[[pt:Rolha]]<br/>+[[zh-yue:枳]]</td>

Historically, the city is the stage of the [[Jhongli incident]] ([http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%AD%E5%A3%A2%E4%BA%8B%E4%BB%B6 中壢事件] ) of 1977, the most significant event of the democratization movements of [[Taiwan]] prior to the 1980s. Ethnically, it is considered a kind of capital city for the [[Hakka people]] who live in great numbers here and in surrounding areas. In recent years a large number of foreign workers (mainly from the [[Philippines]] and [[Thailand]]) have also settled in and around the city, making it a center for foreign laborers.<br/>+<br/>+[[Image:Jhongli3.jpg|thumb|right|Zhongli City Health Dept.]]<br/>+<br/>+== Basic information ==<br/>+* [[Area]]: 76.52 km²<br/>+* [[Population]]: 355,707 people (2006)<br/>+* [[Mayor]]: Ye Pu-liang ( 葉步樑 )<br/>+<br/>+== Transportation ==<br/>+Zhongli is served by both [[National Highway No. 1 (Taiwan)|National Highway No. 1]] and [[Provincial Highway No. 66 (Taiwan)|Provincial Highway No. 66]].

Aside from video games, Nintendo is also the majority owner of the [[Seattle Mariners]], a [[Major League Baseball]] team in [[Seattle]], [[Washington]]. In 2001, Nintendo purchased a sizable portion of [[Gyration Inc]], a company specializing in gyros and motion sensors.<br/>+<br/>+Nintendo has the distinction of historically being both the oldest intact company in the [[video game console]] market and one of the largest and well-known [[console manufacturer]]s, as well as being the most dominant entity in the handheld console market.  <!--The beginning statement of an article should not be a whole description of the subject's history--><br/>+<br/>+==History==<br/>+{{main|History of Nintendo}} <!--It was agreed that this section was the main problem with the articles length. Please do not add anymore information to this section.--><br/>+<br/>+===Early life=== <br/>+Nintendo started as a small Japanese business by [[Fusajiro Yamauchi]] near the end of 1889 as Nintendo Koppai. Based in Kyoto, Japan, the business produced and marketed a [[playing card]] game called [[Hanafuda]]. The handmade cards soon began to gain popularity, and Yamauchi had to hire assistants to mass produce cards to keep up with the demand.<br/>+<br/>+===Middle life===<br/>+In 1956, Hiroshi Yamauchi paid a visit to the US, to engage in talks with the [[United States Playing Card Company]], the dominant playing card manufacturer in the US. Yamauchi was shocked to find that the world's biggest company in his business was relegated to using a small office. This was a turning point where Yamauchi realized the limitations of the playing card business. He then gained access to Disney's characters and put them on the playing cards, in order to drive sales.<br/>+<br/>+In 1963, ''Nintendo Playing Card Company Limited'' was renamed to ''Nintendo Company, Limited'' by Hiroshi. Nintendo now began to experiment in other areas of business using the newly injected capital. During the period of time between 1963 and 1968, Nintendo set up a [[Taxicab|taxi]] company, a "[[love hotel]]" chain, a TV network, a food company (trying to sell instant rice, similar to [[instant noodle]]s), and several other things (including a toy remote controlled vacuum cleaner called Chiritory [http://squirl.info/asset/show/345?c=ToysAndGame&cid=465&i=6]- which was later seen as a two-player game in [[WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgame$]] in 2003). All these ventures failed, except toymaking, where they had some earlier experience from selling playing cards. Then, after the Tokyo Olympics, playing card sales dropped, leaving Nintendo with a measly 60 yen in stocks.<br/>+<br/>+Riddled with debt, Nintendo struggled to survive in the Japanese toy industry; it was still small at this point, and dominated by already well established companies such as [[Bandai]] and [[Tomy]]. Because of the generally short product life cycle of toys, the company always had to come up with new product. This was the beginning of a major new era for Nintendo.<br/>+<br/>+In 1970, [[Hiroshi Yamauchi]] was observing a hanafuda factory.  He noticed an extending arm, which was made by one of their maintenance engineers, [[Gunpei Yokoi]], for his own amusement. Yamauchi ordered Yokoi to develop it as a proper product for the Christmas rush.<br/>+<br/>+The 1970s also saw the hiring of [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], the man who (along with Yokoi) would become a living legend in the world of gaming and the secret to Nintendo's longevity; his creative vision was instrumental in determining the path Nintendo's future (and indeed, the industry's as a whole) would follow. Yokoi began to mentor Miyamoto during this period of time in R&D, teaching him all that he knew.<br/>+<br/>+===Electronic era===<br/>+Nintendo at this time saw how successful video games were and began to dabble in them.  Its first step in that field was to secure the rights to distribute the [[Magnavox Odyssey]] in Japan, which it did in [[1975]].  At the time, home video game consoles were extremely rare &mdash; even the seminal [[Pong|Atari PONG]] console had yet to be produced.  <br/>+<br/>+Nintendo's first video [[arcade game]] was 1978's ''[[Computer Othello]]''; a large handful of others followed in the next several years, ''[[Radar Scope]]'' and ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]'' being among the most famous of these. The early 1980s saw Nintendo's video game division (led by Yokoi) creating some of its most famous arcade titles. The massively popular ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]'' was created in 1981 with Miyamoto as its mastermind, and released in the arcades and on the [[Atari 2600]], [[Intellivision]], and [[ColecoVision]] video game systems (although Nintendo itself generally had no involvement with these early console ports). This release method would be used on several later Nintendo arcade games of this same period, including the original ''[[Mario Bros.]]'' (not to be confused with the later [[Super Mario Bros.]]). <br/>+In addition to this arcade and dedicated console game activity, Nintendo was testing the consumer handheld video game waters with the [[Game & Watch]]. Then, in [[1985]], Nintendo struck gold with its [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] and continued with the handheld gaming market with their highly successful [[GameBoy]]. Nintendo continued producing updates of these two concepts, leading it to become one of the world's most recognized video-game manufacturers.<br/>+<br/>+Now Nintendo's main line-up of video-game systems are the [[Nintendo DS]]/[[Nintendo DS Lite]] the [[Game Boy Advance SP]] / [[GameBoy Micro]], the [[Nintendo GameCube]], and the [[Wii]].<br/>+<br/>+==Gaming systems==<br/>+===Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)===<br/>+[[Image:Nintendo entertainment system.jpeg|thumb|right|100px|The Nintendo Entertainment System]]<br/>+{{main|Nintendo Entertainment System}}<br/>+''Nintendo Entertainment System'', or ''NES'', is an [[8-bit]] [[video game console]] released by Nintendo in [[North America]], [[Brazil]], [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and [[Australia]]. Its [[Japan]]ese equivalent is known as the <br/>+Famicom (Family Computer). NES is the most successful gaming console of its time in Asia and North America, since Nintendo claims to have sold over 60 million NES units worldwide<ref>{{cite web | title=Classic Systems&mdash;Nintendo Entertainment System | work=Nintendo | url=http://www.nintendo.com/systemsclassic?type=nes | format=html | accessdate=February 11 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>. It helped revitalize the video game industry following the [[video game crash of 1983]] and set the standard for subsequent consoles in everything from [[game design]] (the first modern [[platform game]], ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', was the system’s first "[[killer game]]") to business practices. The NES was the first console for which the manufacturer openly courted [[third-party developer]]s.<br/>+<br/>+===Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES)===<br/>+[[Image:Super Nintendo Entertainment System-USA.jpg|thumb|left|100px|The Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]<br/>+{{main|Super Nintendo Entertainment System}}<br/>+The ''Super Nintendo Entertainment System'', also known as ''Super Nintendo'', ''Super NES'' or ''SNES'', is a [[16-bit]] [[video game console]] released by Nintendo in [[North America]], [[Brazil]], [[Europe]], and [[Australia]]. In [[Japan]] it is known as the ''Super Famicom'' (Super Family Computer). In [[South Korea]], it is known as the ''Super Comboy'' and was distributed by Hyundai Electronics. <br/>+ <br/>+The SNES was Nintendo's second home console, following the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. Whereas the earlier system had struggled in the PAL region and large parts of [[Asia]], the SNES proved to be a global success, albeit one that could not match its predecessor's popularity in Northeast Asia and [[North America]]—due in part to increased competition from [[Sega]]'s [[Mega Drive]] console (released in North America as the Genesis). Despite its relatively late start, the SNES became the best selling console of the [[16-bit era]].<br/>+<br/>+===Nintendo 64 (N64)===<br/>+[[Image:Nintendo 64.jpg|thumb|right|100px|The Nintendo 64]]<br/>+{{main|Nintendo 64}}<br/>+The Nintendo 64, commonly called the ''N64'', is Nintendo's third home [[Computer and video games|video game]] [[video game console|console]] for the international market. It was released with three [[launch title|launch game]]s in Japan (''[[Super Mario 64]]'', ''[[Pilotwings 64]]'' and ''[[Saikyou Haniu Shogi]]'') but only two in North America and PAL region (''Super Mario 64'' and ''Pilotwings 64''). Other key titles included two [[Legend of Zelda]] games, and [[Goldeneye]].<br/>+<br/>+===Nintendo GameCube (GC)===<br/>+[[Image:Nintendo_Gamecube_Silver.JPG|thumb|left|100px|The Nintendo GameCube]]<br/>+{{main|Nintendo GameCube}}<br/>+The ''Nintendo GameCube'' was Nintendo's fourth home [[video game console]], belonging to the [[History of video game consoles (sixth generation)|sixth generation era]]—the same generation as [[Sega]]'s [[Sega Dreamcast|Dreamcast]], [[Sony]]'s [[PlayStation 2]], and [[Microsoft]]'s [[Xbox]]. Right up until the console's unveiling at [[SpaceWorld]] [[2000]], the design project was known as ''Dolphin''— this can still be seen in the console and its accessories' model numbers. The GameCube itself was the most compact and least expensive of the sixth generation era consoles. The GameCube was the first Nintendo game console to use [[optical disc]]s rather than game [[Cartridge (electronics)|cartridges]].<br/>+<br/>+===Wii===<br/>+[[Image:Wii at E3 1.png|thumb|right|100px|The Wii]]<br/>+{{main|Wii}}<br/>+''Wii'' (pronounced as the word "[[we]]", [[IPA chart for English|IPA]]: {{IPA|/wiː/}}) is Nintendo's [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|seventh-generation]] [[video game console]].  Its official [[project code name]] was ''Revolution'', and as with the GameCube, this reference appears on the console and its accesories.<br/>+<br/>+The major feature of the Wii is the console's wireless [[Game controller|controller]], the [[Wii Remote]], that may be used as a handheld pointing device and can [[motion detection|detect motion and rotation]] in [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions]]. The controller comes with a "nunchuk" accessory which provides additional controls, including more motion sensing. The controller also contains a [[Loudspeaker|speaker]] and a [[Force feedback|rumble device]] to provide sensory feedback, and can be used to turn the Wii on and off. The console also features a [[sleep mode|stand-by]] mode entitled [[WiiConnect24]], enabling it to receive messages and updates over the [[Internet]] while consuming very little electrical power. The console ships with a [[Wii Sports|free game]], unusual for a games console of its era.<br/>+<br/>+===Game Boy===<br/>+[[Image:Game Boy Advance SP.jpg|thumb|left|100px|The Game Boy Advance SP]]<br/>+{{main|Game Boy line}}<br/>+The {{nihongo|''Game Boy''|ゲームボーイ|Gēmu Bōi}} line is a line of [[Battery (electricity)|battery]]-powered [[handheld game console]]s sold by Nintendo.
