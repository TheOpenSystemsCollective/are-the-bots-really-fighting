Aside from video games, Nintendo is also the majority owner of the [[Seattle Mariners]], a [[Major League Baseball]] team in [[Seattle]], [[Washington]]. In 2001, Nintendo purchased a sizable portion of [[Gyration Inc]], a company specializing in gyros and motion sensors.<br/>+<br/>+Nintendo has the distinction of historically being both the oldest intact company in the [[video game console]] market and one of the largest and well-known [[console manufacturer]]s, as well as being the most dominant entity in the handheld console market.  <!--The beginning statement of an article should not be a whole description of the subject's history--><br/>+<br/>+==History==<br/>+{{main|History of Nintendo}} <!--It was agreed that this section was the main problem with the articles length. Please do not add anymore information to this section.--><br/>+<br/>+===Early life=== <br/>+Nintendo started as a small Japanese business by [[Fusajiro Yamauchi]] near the end of 1889 as Nintendo Koppai. Based in Kyoto, Japan, the business produced and marketed a [[playing card]] game called [[Hanafuda]]. The handmade cards soon began to gain popularity, and Yamauchi had to hire assistants to mass produce cards to keep up with the demand.<br/>+<br/>+===Middle life===<br/>+In 1956, Hiroshi Yamauchi paid a visit to the US, to engage in talks with the [[United States Playing Card Company]], the dominant playing card manufacturer in the US. Yamauchi was shocked to find that the world's biggest company in his business was relegated to using a small office. This was a turning point where Yamauchi realized the limitations of the playing card business. He then gained access to Disney's characters and put them on the playing cards, in order to drive sales.<br/>+<br/>+In 1963, ''Nintendo Playing Card Company Limited'' was renamed to ''Nintendo Company, Limited'' by Hiroshi. Nintendo now began to experiment in other areas of business using the newly injected capital. During the period of time between 1963 and 1968, Nintendo set up a [[Taxicab|taxi]] company, a "[[love hotel]]" chain, a TV network, a food company (trying to sell instant rice, similar to [[instant noodle]]s), and several other things (including a toy remote controlled vacuum cleaner called Chiritory [http://squirl.info/asset/show/345?c=ToysAndGame&cid=465&i=6]- which was later seen as a two-player game in [[WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgame$]] in 2003). All these ventures failed, except toymaking, where they had some earlier experience from selling playing cards. Then, after the Tokyo Olympics, playing card sales dropped, leaving Nintendo with a measly 60 yen in stocks.<br/>+<br/>+Riddled with debt, Nintendo struggled to survive in the Japanese toy industry; it was still small at this point, and dominated by already well established companies such as [[Bandai]] and [[Tomy]]. Because of the generally short product life cycle of toys, the company always had to come up with new product. This was the beginning of a major new era for Nintendo.<br/>+<br/>+In 1970, [[Hiroshi Yamauchi]] was observing a hanafuda factory.  He noticed an extending arm, which was made by one of their maintenance engineers, [[Gunpei Yokoi]], for his own amusement. Yamauchi ordered Yokoi to develop it as a proper product for the Christmas rush.<br/>+<br/>+The 1970s also saw the hiring of [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], the man who (along with Yokoi) would become a living legend in the world of gaming and the secret to Nintendo's longevity; his creative vision was instrumental in determining the path Nintendo's future (and indeed, the industry's as a whole) would follow. Yokoi began to mentor Miyamoto during this period of time in R&D, teaching him all that he knew.<br/>+<br/>+===Electronic era===<br/>+Nintendo at this time saw how successful video games were and began to dabble in them.  Its first step in that field was to secure the rights to distribute the [[Magnavox Odyssey]] in Japan, which it did in [[1975]].  At the time, home video game consoles were extremely rare &mdash; even the seminal [[Pong|Atari PONG]] console had yet to be produced.  <br/>+<br/>+Nintendo's first video [[arcade game]] was 1978's ''[[Computer Othello]]''; a large handful of others followed in the next several years, ''[[Radar Scope]]'' and ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]'' being among the most famous of these. The early 1980s saw Nintendo's video game division (led by Yokoi) creating some of its most famous arcade titles. The massively popular ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]'' was created in 1981 with Miyamoto as its mastermind, and released in the arcades and on the [[Atari 2600]], [[Intellivision]], and [[ColecoVision]] video game systems (although Nintendo itself generally had no involvement with these early console ports). This release method would be used on several later Nintendo arcade games of this same period, including the original ''[[Mario Bros.]]'' (not to be confused with the later [[Super Mario Bros.]]). <br/>+In addition to this arcade and dedicated console game activity, Nintendo was testing the consumer handheld video game waters with the [[Game & Watch]]. Then, in [[1985]], Nintendo struck gold with its [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] and continued with the handheld gaming market with their highly successful [[GameBoy]]. Nintendo continued producing updates of these two concepts, leading it to become one of the world's most recognized video-game manufacturers.<br/>+<br/>+Now Nintendo's main line-up of video-game systems are the [[Nintendo DS]]/[[Nintendo DS Lite]] the [[Game Boy Advance SP]] / [[GameBoy Micro]], the [[Nintendo GameCube]], and the [[Wii]].<br/>+<br/>+==Gaming systems==<br/>+===Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)===<br/>+[[Image:Nintendo entertainment system.jpeg|thumb|right|100px|The Nintendo Entertainment System]]<br/>+{{main|Nintendo Entertainment System}}<br/>+''Nintendo Entertainment System'', or ''NES'', is an [[8-bit]] [[video game console]] released by Nintendo in [[North America]], [[Brazil]], [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and [[Australia]]. Its [[Japan]]ese equivalent is known as the <br/>+Famicom (Family Computer). NES is the most successful gaming console of its time in Asia and North America, since Nintendo claims to have sold over 60 million NES units worldwide<ref>{{cite web | title=Classic Systems&mdash;Nintendo Entertainment System | work=Nintendo | url=http://www.nintendo.com/systemsclassic?type=nes | format=html | accessdate=February 11 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>. It helped revitalize the video game industry following the [[video game crash of 1983]] and set the standard for subsequent consoles in everything from [[game design]] (the first modern [[platform game]], ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', was the system’s first "[[killer game]]") to business practices. The NES was the first console for which the manufacturer openly courted [[third-party developer]]s.<br/>+<br/>+===Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES)===<br/>+[[Image:Super Nintendo Entertainment System-USA.jpg|thumb|left|100px|The Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]<br/>+{{main|Super Nintendo Entertainment System}}<br/>+The ''Super Nintendo Entertainment System'', also known as ''Super Nintendo'', ''Super NES'' or ''SNES'', is a [[16-bit]] [[video game console]] released by Nintendo in [[North America]], [[Brazil]], [[Europe]], and [[Australia]]. In [[Japan]] it is known as the ''Super Famicom'' (Super Family Computer). In [[South Korea]], it is known as the ''Super Comboy'' and was distributed by Hyundai Electronics. <br/>+ <br/>+The SNES was Nintendo's second home console, following the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. Whereas the earlier system had struggled in the PAL region and large parts of [[Asia]], the SNES proved to be a global success, albeit one that could not match its predecessor's popularity in Northeast Asia and [[North America]]—due in part to increased competition from [[Sega]]'s [[Mega Drive]] console (released in North America as the Genesis). Despite its relatively late start, the SNES became the best selling console of the [[16-bit era]].<br/>+<br/>+===Nintendo 64 (N64)===<br/>+[[Image:Nintendo 64.jpg|thumb|right|100px|The Nintendo 64]]<br/>+{{main|Nintendo 64}}<br/>+The Nintendo 64, commonly called the ''N64'', is Nintendo's third home [[Computer and video games|video game]] [[video game console|console]] for the international market. It was released with three [[launch title|launch game]]s in Japan (''[[Super Mario 64]]'', ''[[Pilotwings 64]]'' and ''[[Saikyou Haniu Shogi]]'') but only two in North America and PAL region (''Super Mario 64'' and ''Pilotwings 64''). Other key titles included two [[Legend of Zelda]] games, and [[Goldeneye]].<br/>+<br/>+===Nintendo GameCube (GC)===<br/>+[[Image:Nintendo_Gamecube_Silver.JPG|thumb|left|100px|The Nintendo GameCube]]<br/>+{{main|Nintendo GameCube}}<br/>+The ''Nintendo GameCube'' was Nintendo's fourth home [[video game console]], belonging to the [[History of video game consoles (sixth generation)|sixth generation era]]—the same generation as [[Sega]]'s [[Sega Dreamcast|Dreamcast]], [[Sony]]'s [[PlayStation 2]], and [[Microsoft]]'s [[Xbox]]. Right up until the console's unveiling at [[SpaceWorld]] [[2000]], the design project was known as ''Dolphin''— this can still be seen in the console and its accessories' model numbers. The GameCube itself was the most compact and least expensive of the sixth generation era consoles. The GameCube was the first Nintendo game console to use [[optical disc]]s rather than game [[Cartridge (electronics)|cartridges]].<br/>+<br/>+===Wii===<br/>+[[Image:Wii at E3 1.png|thumb|right|100px|The Wii]]<br/>+{{main|Wii}}<br/>+''Wii'' (pronounced as the word "[[we]]", [[IPA chart for English|IPA]]: {{IPA|/wiː/}}) is Nintendo's [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|seventh-generation]] [[video game console]].  Its official [[project code name]] was ''Revolution'', and as with the GameCube, this reference appears on the console and its accesories.<br/>+<br/>+The major feature of the Wii is the console's wireless [[Game controller|controller]], the [[Wii Remote]], that may be used as a handheld pointing device and can [[motion detection|detect motion and rotation]] in [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions]]. The controller comes with a "nunchuk" accessory which provides additional controls, including more motion sensing. The controller also contains a [[Loudspeaker|speaker]] and a [[Force feedback|rumble device]] to provide sensory feedback, and can be used to turn the Wii on and off. The console also features a [[sleep mode|stand-by]] mode entitled [[WiiConnect24]], enabling it to receive messages and updates over the [[Internet]] while consuming very little electrical power. The console ships with a [[Wii Sports|free game]], unusual for a games console of its era.<br/>+<br/>+===Game Boy===<br/>+[[Image:Game Boy Advance SP.jpg|thumb|left|100px|The Game Boy Advance SP]]<br/>+{{main|Game Boy line}}<br/>+The {{nihongo|''Game Boy''|ゲームボーイ|Gēmu Bōi}} line is a line of [[Battery (electricity)|battery]]-powered [[handheld game console]]s sold by Nintendo.

A candidate had to have a majority of county unit votes to win and if no candidate received a majority, then a run-off election would be held between the top two finishers.<br/>+<br/>+There were 410 County unit votes. The eight most populous counties had six unit votes each (a total of 48), the next thirty most populous counties had four votes each (a total of 120) and the remaining 121 counties had two votes each (a total of 242). The counties with two votes therefore had a majority of the votes, despite only making up one-third of the population in 1962 when the system was abolished by the courts.<br/>+<br/>+[[Eugene Talmadge]]'s 1946 primary victory was due to the Unit system. Talmadge lost to [[James V. Carmichael]] by 16,000 votes but won the election since he received 244 county unit votes, as opposed to 144 for Carmichael.<br/>+<br/>+In 1963, the county unit system was declared unconstitutional by the [[United States Supreme Court]] in its ''[[Gray v. Sanders]]'' decision. The Supreme Court found that the system violated the 'one man, one vote' principle.  The Federal District Court for the District of North Georgia had previously enjoined the state from using the county unit system in the spring of 1962 and had instead instituted a statewide preferential primary.  The gubernatorial primary was won by Sen. Carl Sanders over former Governor Marvin Griffin (a Talmadge-machine backed candidate).<br/>+<br/>+==External links==<br/>+<br/>+*[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-1381 New Georgia Encyclopedia Article]<br/>+* [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=372&invol=368 Gray v.

This terror and the crimes carried out during MLC's war against Bozizé's rebels between October 2002 and March 2003 is now being investigated by the [[International Criminal Court]], which says it has identified 600 rape victims and the real numbers are expected to be higher.<ref name=d>[http://web.archive.org/web/20070614084915/http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/press/pressreleases/ICC-OTP-BN-20070522-220_A_EN.pdf – International Criminal Court: Background – Situation in the Central African Republic, 22 May 2007] {{Wayback|url=http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/press/pressreleases/ICC-OTP-BN-20070522-220_A_EN.pdf|date =20070627171746}}</ref><br/> <br/> Most of the crimes were committed by Congolese MLC soldiers, but Bozizé's rebels, including elements from Chad, were also responsible.<ref name=e>[http://www.sangonet.com/actu-snews/santeah/fich-RCA-unhcr2005.pdf – UNHCR: Fiche Pays République Centrafricaine, January 2005]</ref> During Bozizé's time in power, new clashes have taken place between his soldiers and the MLC. Bozizé has strengthened military presence along the border and deployed an amphibious force patrolling the Ubangi river. There were refugees from DRC in C.A.R. from July 1999 (when Kabila advanced in the region bordering C.A.R.). The refugees were repatriated following an agreement between UNHCR and the governments of the two countries in 2004.

He is normally associated with [[Surrey county cricket teams|Surrey]] teams in general and with the famous [[Chertsey Cricket Club|Chertsey]] club in particular. He continued as a player until he was 50 and played his last match on 2–5 September 1789 for [[All-England Eleven|All-England]] v [[Hampshire county cricket teams|Hampshire]] at [[Vine Cricket Ground|Sevenoaks Vine]].<ref>[http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/0/117.html See scorecard in ''CricketArchive''.]</ref> It is not known what took place in his career following this game, but [[John Major]] suspected that Stevens enlisted in the [[British Army]].
