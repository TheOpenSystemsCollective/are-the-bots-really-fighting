For that mission he founded Arya Samaj enunciating the Ten Universal Principles as a code for Universalism ''Krinvanto Vishwaryam''  meaning the whole world be an abode for Nobles (Aryas). His next step was to take up the difficult task of reforming Hinduism with dedication despite multiple repeated attempts on his personal life.

Hindu priests discouraged the [[laity]] from reading [[Vedic]] scriptures and encouraged rituals, such as bathing in the [[Ganges River]] and feeding of priests on anniversaries, which Dayananda pronounced as [[superstitions]] or self-serving practices. By exhorting the nation to reject such superstitious notions, his aim was to educate the nation to ''Go back to the Vedas''. He wanted the people who followed Hinduism to go back to its roots and to follow the Vedic life, which he pointed out. He exhorted the Hindu nation to accept social reforms, including the importance of Cows for national prosperity as well as the adoption of [[Hindi]] as the national language for national integration. Through his daily life and practice of yoga and asanas, teachings, preaching, sermons and writings, he inspired the Hindu nation to aspire to ''Swarajya'' (self governance), nationalism, and spiritualism.

The anonymous 1869 author had harshly rejected the theories of early LGBT activist [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]] whose "filthy pederasty" he contrasted with chaste, "sublime paedophilia" basing both definitions on the classical meaning ''boy'' for ''œÄŒ±ŒπœÇ'' instead of the non-classical meaning ''child'', and ''ŒµœÅŒ±œÉœÑŒπŒ±'' ("erastia") as pure "sexual desire", contrasted with more sublime ''œÜŒπŒªŒØŒ±''.</ref>. As ''paederastia'' and ''pederasty'' were used in a derogatory manner since the time of ancient Rome until the mid-20th century due to its exclusive sexual meaning while ''paedophilia'' was not due to the originally more sublime meaning of œÜŒπŒªŒØŒ± in classical Greek compared to ŒµœÅŒ±œÉœÑŒπŒ±, the latter version of the story might be more likely.<br/>+<br/>+The term '''''paedophilia erotica''''' was coined in [[1886]] by the Vienna psychiatrist [[Richard Freiherr von Krafft-Ebing|Richard von Krafft-Ebing]] in his writing ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis]]''.<ref>Krafft-Ebing, Richard von (1886).

It is sometimes called a "counterweight trebuchet" in order to distinguish it from an earlier weapon that has come to be called the "traction trebuchet." Sometimes the word ''trebuchet'' is used to refer ambiguously to either weapon, but originally it referred to the counterweighted weapon.<br/>+<br/>+The counterweight trebuchet appeared in both Christian and Muslim lands around the Mediterranean in the twelfth century. It could fling three hundred pound (140&nbsp;kg) projectiles at high speeds into an enemy fortification, quickly obliterating walls and defenses. Occasionally it was used to throw the bodies of people and animals who had died from various diseases including the [[black plague]] over [[castle walls]], in an attempt to infect the people under siege, being the medieval technology for [[biological warfare]]. Trebuchets were far more accurate than other forms of [[medieval]] [[catapults]].<br/>+<br/>+==History==<br/>+[[image:Trebuchet2.png|thumb|right|Side view.]]<br/>+The invention of the trebuchet derives from the ancient [[Sling (weapon)|sling]].  A variation of the sling contained a short piece of wood to extend the arm and provide greater leverage.  This was evolved into the traction trebuchet by the Chinese, in which a number of people pull on ropes attached to the short arm of a lever that has a sling on the long arm.  This type of trebuchet is smaller and has a shorter range but is a more portable machine and has a faster rate of fire than a larger counterweight powered one. The smallest traction trebuchets could be powered by the weight and pulling strength of one person using a single rope; but most were designed and sized to utilize from 20 to 100 men, generally two per rope.  These teams would sometimes be local citizens assisting in the siege or in the defense of their town.  Traction trebuchets had a range of from 200 to well over 300 feet (60 to 100+ meters) when casting weights up to 130 pounds (60&nbsp;kg). It is believed that the first traction trebuchets were used in China as early as in the 5th century BC, descriptions of which can be found in the 5th century BC [[Mozi]].  <br/>+<br/>+The traction trebuchet next appears in Byzantium. The ''Strategikon'' of Emperor Maurice, composed in 539, calls for "ballistae revolving in both directions," ('ŒíŒ±ŒªŒªŒØœÇœÑœÅŒ±œÇ Œ≠Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ∑œÅœâŒ∏ŒµŒΩ œÉœÑœÅŒµœÜœåŒºŒµŒΩŒ±œÇ), probably traction trebuchets. (Dennis 1998, p. 99) The ''Miracles of St. Demetrius'', composed by John I, archbishop of Thessalonike, clearly describe traction trebuchets in the Avaro-Slav artillery: "Hanging from the back sides of these pieces of timber were slings and from the front strong ropes, by which, pulling down and releasing the sling, they propel the stones up high and with a loud noise." (John I 597 1:154, ed. Lemerle 1979)<br/>+<br/>+[[Image:Trebuchet1.png|thumb|right|[[19th century]] French three-quarter drawing of a medieval trebuchet.]]<br/>+There is some doubt as to the exact period in which traction trebuchets or knowledge of them reached Scandinavia. The [[Vikings]] may have known them at a very early stage, as the monk Abbo de St. Germain reports on the [[Siege of Paris (885-886)|siege of Paris]] in his epic ''De bello Parisiaco'' dated about 890 AD that engines of war were used. Another source mentions that Nordic people or "the Norsemen" used engines of war at the siege of Angers as early as 873 AD. <br/>+<br/>+Our first clear written record of a counterweight trebuchet comes from an Islamic scholar, Mardi al-Tarsusi, who wrote in 1187, "Trebuchets are machines invented by unbelieving devils." (Al-Tarsusi, Bodleian MS 264) This by itself suggests that by the time of [[Saladin]], Muslims were acquainted with counterweight engines, but did not believe that Muslims had invented them. Al-Tarsusi does not specifically say that the "unbelieving devils" were Christian Europeans, but Saladin was in fact actively engaged against Crusaders for much of his career, and the manuscript predates the Chinese and Mongol weapons. (Needham p. 218)<br/>+<br/>+At the [[Siege of Acre]] in [[1191]], [[Richard the Lionheart]] assembled two trebuchets which he named "[[God's Own Catapult]]" and "[[Bad Neighbour]]". During a siege of [[Stirling Castle]] in 1304, [[Edward I of England|Edward Longshanks]] ordered his engineers to make a giant trebuchet for the English army, named "[[Warwolf]]". Range and size of the weapons varied. In 1421 the future [[Charles VII of France]] commissioned a trebuchet (''coyllar'') that could shoot a stone of 800&nbsp;kg, while in [[1188]] at Ashyun balls up to 1,500&nbsp;kg were used. Average weight of the projectiles was probably around 50-100&nbsp;kg, with a range of ca. 300 meters. Rate of fire could be noteworthy: at the [[siege of Lisbon]] (1147), two engines were capable of launching a stone every 15 seconds. Also human corpses could be used in special occasion: in [[1422]] Prince [[Sigismund Korybut|Korybut]], for example, in the siege of [[Karl≈°tejn]] shot men and manure within the enemy walls, apparently managing to spread infection among the defenders.<br/>+<br/>+Counterweight trebuchets did not appear in [[China]] until [[1273]], at the [[Battle of Xiangyang|Siege of Fancheng and Xiangyang]]. The [[Mongol]] army, unable to capture the cities despite besieging the [[Song Dynasty|Song]] defenders for years, brought in two Persian engineers who built hinged counterweight trebuchets and soon reduced the cities to rubble, forcing the surrender of the garrison. These engines were called by the Chinese historians the Huihui Pao (ÂõûÂõûÁ†≤) or Xiangyang Pao (Ë•ÑÈôΩÁ†≤) ("huihui" means Muslim), because they were first encountered in that battle.<br/>+<br/>+The largest trebuchets needed exceptional quantities of timber: at the [[siege of Damietta]], in 1249, [[Louis IX of France]] was able to build a stockade for the whole Crusade camp with the wood from 24 captured Egyptian trebuchets. <br/>+<br/>+With the introduction of [[gunpowder]], the trebuchet lost its place as the siege engine of choice to the [[cannon]].  Trebuchets were used both at the [[siege of Burgos]] (1475-1476) and [[siege of Rhodes (1480)|siege of Rhodes]] (1480). The last recorded military use was by [[Hern√°n Cort√©s]], at the [[1521]] siege of the Aztec capital [[Tenochtitl√°n]]. Accounts of the attack note that its use was motivated by the limited supply of gunpowder. The attempt was reportedly unsuccessful: the first projectile landed on the trebuchet itself, destroying it.<br/>+<br/>+In 1779 British forces defending [[Gibraltar]], finding that their cannons were unable to fire far enough for some purposes, constructed a trebuchet. It is unknown how successful this was: the Spanish attackers were eventually defeated, but this was largely due to a [[sortie]].<br/>+<br/>+==Action of the trebuchet==<br/>+A traction trebuchet functions in the same way as a counterweight trebuchet, except that instead of a hoisted weight, the hurling arm is powered by a crew of men, pulling on ropes attached to the short lever arm.  A counterweight trebuchet is powered by a very heavy [[counterweight]], acting on a [[lever]] arm. The fulcrum of the lever (usually an axle) is supported by a high frame, and the counterweight is suspended from the short arm of the lever.  The sling is attached to the end of the long arm of the lever. One end of the sling is captive, while the other end is hooked to the long arm in such a way as to release when the arm and sling reach the optimal hurling angles. The trebuchet is energized by lowering the long arm and raising the weighted short arm, usually with a winch, and is locked into the charged state by a trigger mechanism (cocked). With the long arm lowered near ground level, the sling is loaded with the projectile, and laid out on the ground, with the captive and hooked ends away from the target, and the load and pouch laid on the ground toward the target, under the trebuchet. When the trigger is released, the weighted short arm is driven by gravity into an accelerating pendulum motion, causing the lighter, long arm of the lever to revolve around the fulcrum at the opposite arc, which in turn, pulls the sling and its contents into a whipping motion at the end of the long arm. As the arm continues to swing past the vertical position, the counterweight rises, causing the lever motion to begin to slow down, while the sling continues to whip forward around the end of the long arm. When the sling reaches its launch angle, one end slips from its hook, releasing the projectile toward the target. <br/>+<br/>+Each of the components of the trebuchet affect its performance. The lever is critical. It must be as light as possible, for maximum acceleration, yet strong enough not to break under the stress. The ratio of the length of the long to the short arms of the lever, and to the sling length, are important factors in determining the range of the projectile. The object of a good design is to transfer as much energy as possible from the falling counterweight into the projectile.  The maximum range for a hypothetical 100% energy transfer, <math>R_\textrm{max}</math>, of the projectile can be shown to be <math>R_\textrm{max} = 2 h m_\textrm{c} / m_\textrm{p}</math>, where <math>h</math> is the distance the counterweight falls, and <math>m_\textrm{c}</math> and <math>m_\textrm{p}</math> are the mass of the counterweight and projectile, respectively.  The efficiency of a real trebuchet is then easily determined as the ratio of the actual range achieved to the calculated maximum range.  <br/>+<br/>+Medieval designs were probably carried out by making variations on a scale model and determined empirically. There are no really detailed descriptions of medieval or earlier trebuchets that give, for example, the dimensions or shape of the beam, the ratio of its long arm to its short arm, and so on. No specimens or models from medieval times survive. The few extant contemporary drawings of them are highly schematic and even sometimes show physically impossible proportions. Methods used for optimizing their performance and design were apparently closely held military secrets, and are not available to present-day reconstructors.<br/>+<br/>+Emplacing and aiming the trebuchet was also, no doubt, done by empirical trials. Small adjustments can be made by changing the angle of the hook holding the free end of the sling, a process which requires a heated forge on a full-scale engine. For larger, quicker adjustments, the length of the sling can be altered.  Small adjustments from side-to-side can also be made by moving the channel in which the missile and sling slide in the base of the frame.  The trebuchet itself could be moved as well, but with larger trebuchets, this would have been difficult; the largest trebuchets could weigh many [[ton]]s. <br/>+<br/>+Because of the time required to load the sling and to raise the counterweight, a large trebuchet's rate of fire is slow, often not more than a couple of shots an hour.  This was due both to their sheer size and the massive weight of their counterweights.  Smaller trebuchets can fire a couple of times a minute.  The payload of a trebuchet was usually a large rounded stone, although other projectiles were occasionally used: dead animals, beehives, the severed heads of captured enemies, small stones burned into clay balls which would explode on impact like grapeshot, barrels of burning tar or oil, [[Greek fire]], or even unsuccessful negotiators, prisoners of war, hostages, and captured spies.  Pots of burning lime were also used as projectiles.<br/>+<br/>+Trebuchets were formidably powerful weapons, with a range of up to about 300 [[yard]]s/ 270&nbsp;m. [[Castle]] designers often built their fortifications with trebuchets in mind; for instance, [[Caerphilly Castle]] in [[Wales]] was surrounded by artificial lakes to keep besiegers and their siege weapons at a distance. The range of many trebuchets was in fact shorter than that of an [[English longbow]] in skilled hands, making it somewhat dangerous to be a trebuchet operator during a siege.<br/>+<br/>+A trebuchet can increase its efficiency (and hence either range or payload) by allowing the counterweight to take the straightest possible downward path. This maximizes the transfer of the counterweight's potential energy to the projectile rather than to stressing the frame. Mounting the counterweight on a pivot (below top) straightens the path of its fall, increasing its effectiveness.  A fixed counterweight trebuchet in particular can therefore be made more efficient by the addition of wheels to allow the frame to move freely back and forth (below bottom). This also allowed the trebuchet to fire farther.<br/>+<br/>+The addition of wheels also makes the trebuchet more stable as part of the forward momentum of the falling counterweight is transferred to the forward motion of the trebuchet instead of a tilting action of the vertical frame, possibly tipping over of the machine or severely damaging the structure. The velocity of the trebuchet frame is added to that of the item being thrown, increasing its velocity and range by up to 33 percent. The wheeled trebuchet can effectively employ a fixed counterweight, mounted to the short end of the throwing arm, rather than the pendulum weight described above. The weights were usually stones and rubble, since lead was far too expensive and could be used for better purposes in a siege.<br/>+<br/>+==Modern use==<br/>+Today, many hobbyists build and experiment with trebuchets.  Trebuchets are also used in classrooms to illustrate mechanical and physical principles.  Trebuchets range in size from table-top to huge machines weighing many tons. <br/>+<br/>+The largest working trebuchet of medieval design today is at [[Warwick Castle]], which is used as a tourist attraction and is fired by members of the public under professional supervision. It stands 19&nbsp;m tall and uses a 6&nbsp;tonne counterweight to fire 15&nbsp;kg stone balls distances exceeding several hundred feet. T-Wrecks, a trebuchet with a more contemporary design, can throw pianos weighing 230&nbsp;kg (500 lbs) over 150&nbsp;m (500 ft). In England a group of farmers threw a car close to 120&nbsp;m (400 ft) and a 250 litre (55 [[Imperial gallon]], 66 [[US gallon]]s) drum filled with gasoline over 300&nbsp;m (1000 ft). <br/>+<br/>+Recent modern developments include: the ''floating arm trebuchet''[http://www.trebuchet.com/story.php/fat.html], where the counterweight is constrained to drop down vertically, while the fixed axle is replaced by rollers; a variation is the ''F2K trebuchet''. Other variations are the  "scissor-jack" [http://www.siege-engine.com/ScissorTreb.shtml], "whipper" [http://faculty.ssfs.org/~fullejo/Punkin%20Chunkin/Whipper.htm].  Modern hobbyist trebuchets sometimes replace the counterweight with banks of [[spring (device)|spring]]s[http://www.people.vanderbilt.edu/~frank.v.cioppettini/trebuchet.html].<br/>+<br/>+Another notable variation on the classical trebuchet involves one that props the counterweight in its initial configuration.  Since the center of mass is higher than the conventional one in which the counterweight hangs from the end of the short end of the beam, more energy is available for throwing the projectile.  This is a little more complex, though, and few have been built.  King Arthur, a propped counterweight trebuchet built by the team led by Christopher Gerow, was a [[Punkin Chunkin contest]] champion for four years running.  Its reign was ended in [[2004]] by the huge Yankee Siege[http://www.yankeesiege.com/], video[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lka2VyNHxI], with a record throw of 424.9&nbsp;m (1394 ft). <br/>+<br/>+Another trebuchet type is the multi-rotational trebuchet, which is powered by a weight turning a wheel. Although the wheel allows the counterweight to fall straight down and enables the arm to complete multiple rotations, it creates an important difference that separates multi-rotational trebuchets from others. Whereas the high efficiency of a floating arm trebuchet comes from the constrained motion of the arm in addition to the sling, the high efficiency of a multi-rotational trebuchet comes from the sling alone. Due to the behavior of the sling under multiple rotations, small changes in sling length result in large changes in performance.<br/>+<br/>+A United States organization, [[Science Olympiad]], hosts a "Storm the Castle" event for middle and high school students involving the trebuchet.  The competitors build a small trebuchet that is less than 1 meter on a side (exact dimensions vary from year to year) and are scored based on the distance and accuracy of their throws.<br/>+<br/>+A trebuchet operated by Roloff Farms (featured on the TV show [[Little People, Big World]]) malfunctioned in October 2006, resulting in injuries to two people.<br/>+<br/>+==Etymology==<br/>+Trebuchet  is [[Old French]], from ''trebucher'' "to throw over" &lt; ''tres'' "over, beyond" and ''buc'' "[[torso]]" < [[Latin]]  ''trans'' and a [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] word. <!--the modern French form is ''tr√©buchet'' which dictionaries define as "bird trap" or "assay balance" but online you can see it refers to the siege engine.

A typical blog combines text, images, and links to other blogs, web pages, and other media related to its topic. Most blogs are primarily textual although some focus on [[photograph]]s ([[photoblog]]), [[video]]s ([[vlog]]), or [[audio]] ([[podcasting]]), and are part of a wider network of [[social media]].<br/>+<br/>+The word ''blog'' can also be used as a verb, meaning ''to maintain or add content to a blog.''<br/>+<br/>+== History ==<br/>+[[Chronicle]]s, [[commonplace]]s, [[personal journal|diaries]], and [[perzine]]s can all be seen as predecessors of blogs.<br/>+<br/>+Before blogging became popular, digital communities took many forms, including [[Usenet]], [[electronic mailing list|e-mail lists]] and [[bulletin board system]]s (BBS). In the 1990s, [[Internet forum]] software, such as [[WebEx]], created running conversations with "threads". Threads are topical connections between messages on a metaphorical "corkboard".<br/>+<br/>+=== 1994 ‚Äì 2001 ===<br/>+{{Main|Online diary}}<br/>+[[Image:Brad Fitzpatrick.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Brad Fitzpatrick]], an early blogger.]]<br/>+The modern blog evolved from the [[online diary]] where people would keep a running account of their personal lives. Most such writers called themselves diarists, [[journalist]]s, or journalers. A few called themselves [[escribitionist]]s. The Open Pages [[webring]] included members of the online-journal community. [[Justin Hall]], who began eleven years of personal blogging in 1994 while a student at [[Swarthmore College]], is generally recognized as one of the earliest bloggers.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/02/20/MNGBKBEJO01.DTL|title=Time to get a life ‚Äî pioneer blogger Justin Hall bows out at 31|publisher=SFgate|date=2005-02-20|accessdate=2006-06-09}}</ref><br/>+<br/>+Other forms of journals kept online also existed. A notable example was game programmer [[John Carmack|John Carmack's]] widely read journal, published via the [[finger protocol]]. Websites, including both corporate sites and [[personal homepage]]s, had and still often have "What's New" or "News" sections, often on the [[home page|index page]] and sorted by date. One example of a news based "weblog" is the [http://drudgereport.com/ "Drudge Report"] founded by the self styled maverick reporter [[Matt Drudge]], though apparently Drudge dislikes this classification. One noteworthy early precursor to a blog was the [[tongue-in-cheek]] personal website that was frequently updated by [[Usenet]] legend [[Kibo]].<br/>+<br/>+Early weblogs were simply manually updated components of common [[website]]s. However, the evolution of tools to facilitate the production and maintenance of web articles posted in said chronological fashion made the publishing process feasible to a much larger, less technical, population. Ultimately, this resulted in the distinct class of online publishing that produces blogs we recognize today. For instance, the use of some sort of browser-based software is now a typical aspect of "blogging". blogs can be hosted by dedicated [[blog hosting service]]s, or they can be run using [[blog software]], such as [[blogger (service)|blogger]] or [[LiveJournal]], or on regular [[web hosting service]]s, such as [[DreamHost]].<br/>+<br/>+The term "weblog" was coined by [[Jorn Barger]] on [[17 December]] [[1997]]. The short form, "blog," was coined by Peter Merholz, who jokingly broke the word ''weblog'' into the phrase ''we blog'' in the sidebar of his blog Peterme.com in April or May of 1999.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/surveys/displaystory.cfm?story_id=6794172|title=It's the links, stupid|publisher=[[The Economist]]|date=2006-4-20|accessdate=2006-07-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/19991013021124/http://peterme.com/index.html|title=Peterme.com|author=Peter Merholz|publisher=[[The Internet Archive]]|date=1999|accessdate=2006-07-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kottke.org/03/08/its-weblog-not-web-log|author=[[Jason Kottke]]|title=kottke.org|date=August 26, 2003|accessdate=2006-07-21}}</ref> This was quickly adopted as both a noun and verb ("to blog," meaning "to edit one's weblog or to post to one's weblog").<br/>+<br/>+After a slow start, blogging rapidly gained in popularity: the site [[Xanga]], launched in 1996, had only 100 diaries by 1997, but over 50,000,000 as of December 2005. Blog usage spread during 1999 and the years following, being further popularized by the near-simultaneous arrival of the first hosted blog tools:<br/>+* [[Open Diary]] launched in October 1998, soon growing to thousands of online diaries. Open Diary innovated the reader comment, becoming the first blog community where readers could add comments to other writers' blog entries.<br/>+* [[Brad Fitzpatrick]] started [[LiveJournal]] in March 1999.<br/>+* Andrew Smales created [[Pitas.com]] in July 1999 as an easier alternative to maintaining a "news page" on a website, followed by [[Diaryland]] in September 1999, focusing more on a personal diary community.<ref>Jensen, Mallory [http://www.cjr.org/issues/2003/5/blog-jensen.asp?printerfriendly=yes A Brief History of Weblogs]</ref><br/>+* [[Evan Williams (blogger)|Evan Williams]] and [[Meg Hourihan]] ([[Pyra Labs]]) launched [[blogger.com]] in August 1999 (purchased by [[Google]] in February 2003)<br/>+<!-- * Paul Kedrosky's [[GrokSoup]] -- EXPAND OR DELETE? --><br/>+<br/>+Blogging combined the personal web page with tools to make linking to other pages easier &mdash; specifically [[permalink]]s, [[blogroll]]s and [[TrackBack]]s. This, together with [[List of search engines#blog search engines|weblog search engines]] enabled bloggers to track the threads that connected them to others with similar interests.<br/>+<br/>+=== 2001 ‚Äì 2004 ===<br/>+Several broadly popular American blogs emerged in 2001: [[Andrew Sullivan]]'s AndrewSullivan.com, [[Ron Gunzburger]]'s [[Politics1.com]], Taegan Goddard's [[Political Wire]] and [[Jerome Armstrong]]'s [[MyDD]] ‚Äî all blogging primarily on [[political blog|politics]] (two earlier popular American political blogs were Bob Somerby's [[Daily Howler]] launched in 1998 and [[Mickey Kaus]]' Kausfiles launched in 1999).<br/>+<br/>+By 2001, blogging was enough of a phenomenon that how-to manuals began to appear, primarily focusing on technique. The importance of the blogging community (and its relationship to larger society) increased rapidly. Established schools of [[journalism]] began researching blogging and noting the differences between journalism and blogging.<br/>+<br/>+In 2002, Jerome Armstrong's friend and sometime [[business]] partner [[Markos Moulitsas Z√∫niga]] began [[Daily Kos|DailyKos]]. With up to a million visits a day during peak events, it has now become one of the Internet's most trafficked blogs.<br/>+<br/>+Also in 2002, many blogs focused on comments by [[United States Senate Majority Leader|U.S. Senate Majority Leader]] [[Trent Lott]]. Senator Lott, at a party honoring [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Strom Thurmond]], praised Senator Thurmond by suggesting that the United States would have been better off had Thurmond been elected president. Lott's critics saw these comments as a tacit approval of [[racial segregation]], a policy advocated by Thurmond's [[U.S. presidential election, 1948|1948 presidential campaign]]. This view was reinforced by documents and recorded interviews dug up by bloggers. (See [[Josh Marshall]]'s ''[[Talking Points Memo]]''.) Though Lott's comments were made at a public event attended by the media, no major media organizations reported on his controversial comments until after blogs broke the story.  Blogging helped to create a political crisis that forced Lott to step down as majority leader.<br/>+<br/>+The impact of this story gave greater credibility to blogs as a medium of news dissemination. Though often seen as partisan gossips, bloggers sometimes lead the way in bringing key information to public light, with mainstream media having to follow their lead. More often, however, news blogs tend to react to material already published by the mainstream media.<br/>+<br/>+Since 2002, blogs have gained increasing notice and coverage for their role in breaking, shaping, and [[Spin (public relations)|spinning]] [[news]] stories. The [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq war]] saw bloggers taking measured and passionate points of view that go beyond the traditional [[left-right politics|left-right]] divide of the [[political spectrum]].<br/>+<br/>+Blogging by established politicians and political candidates, to express opinions on war and other issues, cemented blogs' role as a news source. (See [[Howard Dean]] and [[Wesley Clark]].) Meanwhile, an increasing number of experts blogged, making blogs a source of in-depth analysis. (See Daniel Drezner and [[J. Bradford DeLong]].)<br/>+<br/>+The second Iraq war was the first "blog war" in another way: Iraqi bloggers gained wide readership, and one, [[Salam Pax]], published a book of his blog. Blogs were also created by soldiers serving in the Iraq war. Such "[[warblog]]" gave readers new perspectives on the realities of war, as well as often offering different viewpoints from those of official news sources.<br/>+<br/>+Blogging was used to draw attention to obscure news sources. For example, bloggers posted links to traffic cameras in Madrid as a huge anti-terrorism demonstration filled the streets in the wake of the [[11 March 2004 Madrid attacks|March 11 attacks]].<br/>+<br/>+Bloggers began to provide nearly-instant commentary on televised events, creating a secondary meaning of the word "blogging": to simultaneously transcribe and [[Editorial|editorialize]] speeches and events shown on television. (For example, "I am blogging Rice's testimony" means "I am posting my reactions to [[Condoleezza Rice|Condoleezza Rice's]] testimony into my blog as I watch her on television.") Real-time commentary is sometimes referred to as "liveblogging."<br/>+<br/>+=== 2004 ‚Äì present ===<br/>+[[Image:Wordpress main theme.png|thumb|300px|A [[WordPress]] test blog running [[Kubrick (Wordpress theme)|Kubrick]].]]<br/>+In 2004, the role of blogs became increasingly mainstream, as [[political consultant]]s, news services and candidates began using them as tools for outreach and opinion forming. Even politicians not actively campaigning, such as the [[Labour Party (UK)|UK's Labour Party's]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Tom Watson (politician)|Tom Watson]], began to blog to bond with constituents.<br/>+<br/>+[[Minnesota Public Radio]] broadcast a program by [[Christopher Lydon]] and [[Matt Stoller]] called "The blogging of the President," which covered a transformation in politics that blogging seemed to presage. The ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'' began regular coverage of blogs and blogging. Anthologies of blog pieces reached print, and blogging personalities began appearing on radio and television. In the summer of 2004, both United States [[Democratic National Convention|Democratic]] and [[Republican National Convention|Republican]] Parties' conventions credentialed bloggers, and blogs became a standard part of the publicity arsenal. Mainstream television programs, such as [[Chris Matthews]]' ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews|Hardball]]'', formed their own blogs. [[Merriam-Webster]]'s Dictionary declared "blog" as the word of the year in 2004.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/blog_declared_Word_of_the_Year Wikinews|publisher=Wikinews|title=blog declared Word of the Year|date=2004-12-01|accessdate=2006-06-22}}</ref><br/>+<br/>+Blogs were among the driving forces behind the "[[Rathergate]]" scandal, to wit: (television journalist) Dan Rather presented documents (on the CBS show ''[[60 Minutes]]'') that conflicted with accepted accounts of [[President Bush's military service]] record. Bloggers declared the documents to be [[forgery|forgeries]] and presented evidence and arguments in support of that view, and CBS apologized for what it said were inadequate reporting techniques (see [[Little Green Footballs]]). Many bloggers view this scandal as the advent of blogs' acceptance by the mass media, both as a source of news and opinion and as means of applying political pressure.<br/>+<br/>+Some bloggers have moved over to other media. The following bloggers (and others) have appeared on radio and television: [[Atrios|Duncan Black]] (known widely by his pseudonym, Atrios), [[Glenn Reynolds]] ([[Instapundit]]) , [[Markos Moulitsas Z√∫niga]] ([[Daily Kos]]), [[Alex Steffen]] ([[Worldchanging]]) and [[Ana Marie Cox]] ([[Wonkette]]). [[Hugh Hewitt]] is an example of a media personality who has moved in the other direction, adding to his reach in "old media" by being an influential blogger.<br/>+<br/>+Some blogs were an important source of news during the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|December 2004 Tsunami]] such as [[Medecins Sans Frontieres]], which used SMS text messaging to report from affected areas in Sri Lanka and Southern India.<br/>+<br/>+In the [[United Kingdom]], ''[[The Guardian]]'' [[newspaper]] launched a redesign in September 2005, which included a daily digest of blogs on page 2. Also in June 2006, [[BBC News]] launched a weblog for its editors, following other news companies <ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/5116654.stm|title=Down with blogs... so here's another|first=Dawn|last=Wilson|date=2006-06-26|accessdate=2006-06-26|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref>.<br/>+<br/>+In January 2005, ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine listed eight bloggers that business people "could not ignore": [[Engadget|Peter Rojas]], [[Xeni Jardin]], [[Ben Trott]], [[Mena Trott]], [[Jonathan I.

Technorati provides current information on both popular searches and [[tag]]s used to categorize blog postings.<br/>+<br/>+== Business models ==<br/>+{{unsourced}}<br/>+While the great majority of blogs are non-commercial, full-time bloggers have struggled to find a way to make a profit from their work. The most common and simplest method is to accept targeted [[web banner|banner advertising]]. However, some bloggers have been hesitant to use this because of negative reader response to the ads. A more discreet form of advertising is for bloggers to promote merchandise from other sites, receiving a commission when a customer buys the item after following a blog link.<br/>+<br/>+Others have tried a [[click-to-donate]] model. Prominent political blogger [[Andrew Sullivan]] claimed at one point that accepting voluntary donations to his blog was more lucrative than his magazine work for [[The New Republic]]. Following the practice of public television, Sullivan boosted donations with periodic "[[pledge drives]]," one of which was reported to net him $120,000. Sullivan's attempt at securing corporate sponsorship for his blog fell apart after strong negative reader response to the deal.<br/>+<br/>+No other high-profile blogger has accepted a single corporate sponsor since Sullivan's failed deal. However, In the early twenty-first century, many magazines and newspapers began sponsoring personal blogs by their employees. The business model in this case is essentially the same as that of a traditional newspaper columnist. In a creative extension of the model, employees at other media companies began blogs focusing on the companies' products. For example, many actors in pornography blog about their work on company sites, creating a sense of personal connection between consumer and product.<br/>+<br/>+== Anatomy of a blog entry ==<br/>+[[Image:Typical blog.png|thumb|250px|A [[screenshot]] of a typical blog.]]<br/>+A variety of different systems are used to create and maintain blogs. Dedicated [[web application]]s can eliminate the need for bloggers to manage this software. With web interfaces, these systems allow travelers to blog from anywhere on the Internet, and allow users to create blogs without having to maintain their own server. Such systems allow users to work with tools such as Ecto, Elicit and [[Blogger (service)|Blogger]] which allow users to maintain their Web-hosted blog without the need to be online while composing or editing posts. Blog creation tools and blog hosting are also provided by some Web hosting companies ([[Tripod]]), Internet service providers ([[America Online]]), online publications ([[Salon.com]]) and internet portals ([[Yahoo! 360¬∞]] or [[Google]]). Some advanced users have developed custom blogging systems from scratch using [[Server-side scripting|server-side]] software, and often implement membership management and password protected areas. Others have created a mix of a blog and wiki, called a [[bliki]].<br/>+<br/>+A blog entry typically consists of the following:<br/>+* ''Title'', the main title, or headline, of the post.<br/>+* ''Body'', main content of the post.<br/>+* ''[[Permalink]]'', the [[URL]] of the full, individual article.<br/>+* ''Post Date'', date and time the post was published.<br/>+<br/>+A blog entry optionally includes the following:<br/>+* ''Comments''<br/>+* ''Categories'' (or [[tag]]s) - subjects that the entry discusses<br/>+* ''[[Trackback]]'' and or ''[[pingback]]'' - links to other sites that refer to the entry<br/>+<br/>+=== Comments ===<br/>+{{main|Feedback comment system}}<br/>+<br/>+Comments are a way to provide discussion on blog entries. Readers can leave a [[comment]] on a post, which can correct errors or contain their opinion on the post or the post's subject. Services like [[coComment]] aim to ease discussion through comments, by allowing tracking of them.<br/>+<br/>+== Blog popularity ==<br/>+Recently, researchers have analyzed the dynamics of how blogs become popular. There are essentially two measures of this: popularity through citations, as well as popularity through affiliation (i.e. [[blogroll]]). The basic conclusion from studies of the structure of blogs is that while it takes time for a blog to become popular through blogrolls, permalinks can boost popularity more quickly, and are perhaps more indicative of popularity and authority than blogrolls, since they denote that people are actually reading the blog's content and deem it valuable or noteworthy in specific cases.<ref>Marlow, C.

Some institutions see blogging as a means of "getting around the filter" and pushing [[messages]] directly to the public. Some critics worry that bloggers respect neither [[copyright]] nor the role of the [[mass media]] in presenting society with credible news.<br/>+<br/>+Bloggers' credibility problem, however, can be an advantage for the bloggers and for the mainstream journalists who take an interest in them. News organizations are sometimes reluctant to tell stories that will upset important people. But when bloggers or activists make sensational claims, then they become stories themselves, and journalists can use them as cover for reporting the underlying scandals.<br/>+<br/>+Many mainstream journalists, meanwhile, write their own blogs -- well over 300, according to CyberJournalist.net's J-blog list. The first known use of a Weblog on a news site was in August 1998, when [[Jonathan Dube]] of The [[Charlotte Observer]] published one chronicling Hurricane Bonnie.<ref>{{cite news|title=blogging Bonnie.|work=Poynter.org|date=18 September, 2003 |url=http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=52&aid=48413/}}</ref><br/>+<br/>+Blogs have also had an influence on [[minority language]]s, bringing together scattered speakers and learners; this is particularly so with blogs in [[Goidelic language|Gaelic languages]], whose creators can be found as far away from traditional Gaelic areas as [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Alaska]]. Minority language publishing (which may lack economic feasibility) can find its audience through inexpensive blogging.<br/>+<br/>+== Legal issues ==<br/>+The emergence of blogging has brought a range of legal liabilities.

Several cases have been brought before the national courts against bloggers and the courts have returned with mixed verdicts. In ''John Doe v. Patrick Cahill'', the [[Delaware Supreme Court]] held that stringent standards had to be met to unmask anonymous bloggers, and also took the unusual step of dismissing the libel case itself (as unfounded under American libel law) rather than referring it back to the [[trial court]] for reconsideration. In a bizarre twist, the Cahills were able to find the ISP address of John Doe, who turned out to be the person they suspected: the town's mayor, Councilman Cahill's political rival. The Cahills amended their original complaint, and the mayor settled the case rather than going to trial. <ref>[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data2/delawarestatecases/266-2005.pdf "John Doe No. 1 v.
