Please do not add anymore information to this section.--><br/>+<br/>+===Early life=== <br/>+Nintendo started as a small Japanese business by [[Fusajiro Yamauchi]] near the end of 1889 as Nintendo Koppai. Based in Kyoto, Japan, the business produced and marketed a [[playing card]] game called [[Hanafuda]]. The handmade cards soon began to gain popularity, and Yamauchi had to hire assistants to mass produce cards to keep up with the demand.<br/>+<br/>+===Middle life===<br/>+In 1956, Hiroshi Yamauchi paid a visit to the US, to engage in talks with the [[United States Playing Card Company]], the dominant playing card manufacturer in the US. Yamauchi was shocked to find that the world's biggest company in his business was relegated to using a small office. This was a turning point where Yamauchi realized the limitations of the playing card business. He then gained access to Disney's characters and put them on the playing cards, in order to drive sales.<br/>+<br/>+In 1963, ''Nintendo Playing Card Company Limited'' was renamed to ''Nintendo Company, Limited'' by Hiroshi. Nintendo now began to experiment in other areas of business using the newly injected capital. During the period of time between 1963 and 1968, Nintendo set up a [[Taxicab|taxi]] company, a "[[love hotel]]" chain, a TV network, a food company (trying to sell instant rice, similar to [[instant noodle]]s), and several other things (including a toy remote controlled vacuum cleaner called Chiritory [http://squirl.info/asset/show/345?c=ToysAndGame&cid=465&i=6]- which was later seen as a two-player game in [[WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgame$]] in 2003). All these ventures failed, except toymaking, where they had some earlier experience from selling playing cards. Then, after the Tokyo Olympics, playing card sales dropped, leaving Nintendo with a measly 60 yen in stocks.<br/>+<br/>+Riddled with debt, Nintendo struggled to survive in the Japanese toy industry; it was still small at this point, and dominated by already well established companies such as [[Bandai]] and [[Tomy]]. Because of the generally short product life cycle of toys, the company always had to come up with new product. This was the beginning of a major new era for Nintendo.<br/>+<br/>+In 1970, [[Hiroshi Yamauchi]] was observing a hanafuda factory.  He noticed an extending arm, which was made by one of their maintenance engineers, [[Gunpei Yokoi]], for his own amusement. Yamauchi ordered Yokoi to develop it as a proper product for the Christmas rush.<br/>+<br/>+The 1970s also saw the hiring of [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], the man who (along with Yokoi) would become a living legend in the world of gaming and the secret to Nintendo's longevity; his creative vision was instrumental in determining the path Nintendo's future (and indeed, the industry's as a whole) would follow. Yokoi began to mentor Miyamoto during this period of time in R&D, teaching him all that he knew.<br/>+<br/>+===Electronic era===<br/>+Nintendo at this time saw how successful video games were and began to dabble in them.  Its first step in that field was to secure the rights to distribute the [[Magnavox Odyssey]] in Japan, which it did in [[1975]].  At the time, home video game consoles were extremely rare &mdash; even the seminal [[Pong|Atari PONG]] console had yet to be produced.  <br/>+<br/>+Nintendo's first video [[arcade game]] was 1978's ''[[Computer Othello]]''; a large handful of others followed in the next several years, ''[[Radar Scope]]'' and ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]'' being among the most famous of these. The early 1980s saw Nintendo's video game division (led by Yokoi) creating some of its most famous arcade titles. The massively popular ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]'' was created in 1981 with Miyamoto as its mastermind, and released in the arcades and on the [[Atari 2600]], [[Intellivision]], and [[ColecoVision]] video game systems (although Nintendo itself generally had no involvement with these early console ports). This release method would be used on several later Nintendo arcade games of this same period, including the original ''[[Mario Bros.]]'' (not to be confused with the later [[Super Mario Bros.]]). <br/>+In addition to this arcade and dedicated console game activity, Nintendo was testing the consumer handheld video game waters with the [[Game & Watch]]. Then, in [[1985]], Nintendo struck gold with its [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] and continued with the handheld gaming market with their highly successful [[GameBoy]]. Nintendo continued producing updates of these two concepts, leading it to become one of the world's most recognized video-game manufacturers.<br/>+<br/>+Now Nintendo's main line-up of video-game systems are the [[Nintendo DS]]/[[Nintendo DS Lite]] the [[Game Boy Advance SP]] / [[GameBoy Micro]], the [[Nintendo GameCube]], and the [[Wii]].<br/>+<br/>+==Gaming systems==<br/>+===Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)===<br/>+[[Image:Nintendo entertainment system.jpeg|thumb|right|100px|The Nintendo Entertainment System]]<br/>+{{main|Nintendo Entertainment System}}<br/>+''Nintendo Entertainment System'', or ''NES'', is an [[8-bit]] [[video game console]] released by Nintendo in [[North America]], [[Brazil]], [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and [[Australia]]. Its [[Japan]]ese equivalent is known as the <br/>+Famicom (Family Computer). NES is the most successful gaming console of its time in Asia and North America, since Nintendo claims to have sold over 60 million NES units worldwide<ref>{{cite web | title=Classic Systems&mdash;Nintendo Entertainment System | work=Nintendo | url=http://www.nintendo.com/systemsclassic?type=nes | format=html | accessdate=February 11 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>. It helped revitalize the video game industry following the [[video game crash of 1983]] and set the standard for subsequent consoles in everything from [[game design]] (the first modern [[platform game]], ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', was the system’s first "[[killer game]]") to business practices. The NES was the first console for which the manufacturer openly courted [[third-party developer]]s.<br/>+<br/>+===Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES)===<br/>+[[Image:Super Nintendo Entertainment System-USA.jpg|thumb|left|100px|The Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]<br/>+{{main|Super Nintendo Entertainment System}}<br/>+The ''Super Nintendo Entertainment System'', also known as ''Super Nintendo'', ''Super NES'' or ''SNES'', is a [[16-bit]] [[video game console]] released by Nintendo in [[North America]], [[Brazil]], [[Europe]], and [[Australia]]. In [[Japan]] it is known as the ''Super Famicom'' (Super Family Computer). In [[South Korea]], it is known as the ''Super Comboy'' and was distributed by Hyundai Electronics. <br/>+ <br/>+The SNES was Nintendo's second home console, following the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. Whereas the earlier system had struggled in the PAL region and large parts of [[Asia]], the SNES proved to be a global success, albeit one that could not match its predecessor's popularity in Northeast Asia and [[North America]]—due in part to increased competition from [[Sega]]'s [[Mega Drive]] console (released in North America as the Genesis). Despite its relatively late start, the SNES became the best selling console of the [[16-bit era]].<br/>+<br/>+===Nintendo 64 (N64)===<br/>+[[Image:Nintendo 64.jpg|thumb|right|100px|The Nintendo 64]]<br/>+{{main|Nintendo 64}}<br/>+The Nintendo 64, commonly called the ''N64'', is Nintendo's third home [[Computer and video games|video game]] [[video game console|console]] for the international market. It was released with three [[launch title|launch game]]s in Japan (''[[Super Mario 64]]'', ''[[Pilotwings 64]]'' and ''[[Saikyou Haniu Shogi]]'') but only two in North America and PAL region (''Super Mario 64'' and ''Pilotwings 64''). Other key titles included two [[Legend of Zelda]] games, and [[Goldeneye]].<br/>+<br/>+===Nintendo GameCube (GC)===<br/>+[[Image:Nintendo_Gamecube_Silver.JPG|thumb|left|100px|The Nintendo GameCube]]<br/>+{{main|Nintendo GameCube}}<br/>+The ''Nintendo GameCube'' was Nintendo's fourth home [[video game console]], belonging to the [[History of video game consoles (sixth generation)|sixth generation era]]—the same generation as [[Sega]]'s [[Sega Dreamcast|Dreamcast]], [[Sony]]'s [[PlayStation 2]], and [[Microsoft]]'s [[Xbox]]. Right up until the console's unveiling at [[SpaceWorld]] [[2000]], the design project was known as ''Dolphin''— this can still be seen in the console and its accessories' model numbers. The GameCube itself was the most compact and least expensive of the sixth generation era consoles. The GameCube was the first Nintendo game console to use [[optical disc]]s rather than game [[Cartridge (electronics)|cartridges]].<br/>+<br/>+===Wii===<br/>+[[Image:Wii at E3 1.png|thumb|right|100px|The Wii]]<br/>+{{main|Wii}}<br/>+''Wii'' (pronounced as the word "[[we]]", [[IPA chart for English|IPA]]: {{IPA|/wiː/}}) is Nintendo's [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|seventh-generation]] [[video game console]].  Its official [[project code name]] was ''Revolution'', and as with the GameCube, this reference appears on the console and its accesories.<br/>+<br/>+The major feature of the Wii is the console's wireless [[Game controller|controller]], the [[Wii Remote]], that may be used as a handheld pointing device and can [[motion detection|detect motion and rotation]] in [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions]]. The controller comes with a "nunchuk" accessory which provides additional controls, including more motion sensing. The controller also contains a [[Loudspeaker|speaker]] and a [[Force feedback|rumble device]] to provide sensory feedback, and can be used to turn the Wii on and off. The console also features a [[sleep mode|stand-by]] mode entitled [[WiiConnect24]], enabling it to receive messages and updates over the [[Internet]] while consuming very little electrical power. The console ships with a [[Wii Sports|free game]], unusual for a games console of its era.<br/>+<br/>+===Game Boy===<br/>+[[Image:Game Boy Advance SP.jpg|thumb|left|100px|The Game Boy Advance SP]]<br/>+{{main|Game Boy line}}<br/>+The {{nihongo|''Game Boy''|ゲームボーイ|Gēmu Bōi}} line is a line of [[Battery (electricity)|battery]]-powered [[handheld game console]]s sold by Nintendo.

As a singles heel through the sixties, he was a top-of-card fixture battling well-established crowd favourites such as Mark Lewin, Spiros Arion, Tex Mackenzie, Dominic Denucci and Mario Milano. Enormous numbers from Australia's nascent ethnic community turned out to support Arion, Denucci and Milano, and Kox risked riots at every appearance. His brainbuster finisher was as famous as his chronic rule breaking and surreptitious use of foreign objects. Fans longed to see the brainbuster deployed on the side of good, and this boon was granted in 1971 when the Killer turned into a good guy in a nationally televised mea culpa - he pledged to change his ways on a solemn promise to his dying mother. <br/>+<br/>+This created much heat in the already booming Australian wrestling promotion, where the fixture was an ongoing television "war" between the good guys referred to as "The People's Army" (Lewin, Curtis, Arion, Milano and visiting faces from overseas) and the "mercenary soldiers" managed by Kentucky biker / preacher Big Bad John. The turning of the tables saw the erstwhile Killer create great excitement in tag matches against his former heel comrades Abdullah the Butcher, Brute Bernard, Dick "The Bulldog" Brower, Tiger Singh, Waldo Von Ehrich and Japanese badboys like Mr Fuiji and the Tojo Brothers.<br/>+<br/>+In the wrestling profession, Killer Karl Kox was always a popular figure for his humour, behind-the-scenes practical jokes and inventiveness in furthering the promotion ("the greatest gimmicks man in the business" said one admiring colleague). His grudge matches were well-calibrated and exciting, building through a series of disqualifications and non-decisions through run-in interference, and often climaxing in a conditional match in which "the loser packs his bags and leaves town." This saw off one or the other of the combatants as they travelled to fulfill other promotional runs in other countries; battle would be re-joined next season when the participants returned for another highly profitable run. <br/>+<br/>+Among Killer Karl Kox's famous matches in Australia, his feuds with man-mountain Haystacks Calhoun usually involved the insinuation of foreign objects into the proceedings by Kox. At the end of one season, Kox "left Australia for medical treatment in the states" when, in a strap match with Bulldog Brower, his eye was nearly removed (the wound was unbandaged to show the television audience). A headline making event was when a television match for the Australian championship against Spiros Arion was declared ended due to time limit by well-loved commentator Jack Little. Kox responded by applying the Brain Buster to the unfortunate Little, who was hospitalized and required to call matches the following month in a neck brace.<br/>+<br/>+=== Stage names ===<br/>+*'''Killer Karl Kox'''<br/>+*Killer Kox<br/>+*Masked Menace<br/>+*"Killer" Carl Cox<br/>+<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:karlkoxdusty.jpg|left|Killer Karl Kox choking Dusty Rhodes]] --><br/>+<br/>+== Championships and accomplishments==<br/>+'''[[National Wrestling Alliance]]'''<br/>+*'''Regional'''<br/>+:*NWA Central States Tag Team Championship (1 time) - with [[Akihisa Mera|Takachiho]]<br/>+:*NWA Florida Brass Knuckles Championship (3 times)<br/>+:*[[NWA Florida Heavyweight Championship]] (1 time)<br/>+:*[[NWA Florida United States Tag Team Championship]] (4 times) - with Bobby Duncum (1), [[Dick Slater]] (1), and [[Jimmy Garvin]] (2)<br/>+:*[[NWA Georgia Heavyweight Championship]] (1 time)<br/>+:*[[NWA Southeast Heavyweight Championship]] (3 times)<br/>+'''[[Universal Wrestling Federation (United States)|Mid-South Wrestling]]'''<br/>+:*[[UWF Tag Team Championship|Mid-South Tag Team Championship]] (1 time) - with [[Sylvester Ritter|Junkyard Dog]]<br/>+:*[[Mid-South North American Championship|NWA Tri-State North American Championship]] (1 time)<br/>+'''[[All Japan Pro Wrestling]]'''<br/>+:*AJPW All Asian Tag Team Championship (1 time) - with Joe Carrollo<br/>+:*NWA International Tag Team Championship (1 time) - with Cyclone Negro<br/>+'''[[World Class Championship Wrestling]]'''<br/>+:*[[NWA Texas Brass Knuckles Championship|WCCW Texas Brass Knuckles Championship]] (3 times)<br/>+'''[[Pro Wrestling Illustrated]]'''<br/>+*''Pro Wrestling Illustrated'' ranked him # '''417''' of the 500 best singles wrestlers during the "PWI Years" in 2003.<br/>+<br/>+== Reference ==<br/>+<!-- *[http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/profiles/k/killer-karl-kox.html Profile at obsessedwithwrestling.com] blacklisted link --><br/>+<br/>+{{DEFAULTSORT:Gerwig, Herb}}<br/>+[[Category:Year of birth missing]]<br/>+[[Category:Living people]]<br/>+[[Category:American professional wrestlers]]</td>

The islands are a self-governing [[British overseas territories|Overseas Territory]] of the [[United Kingdom]], but have been the subject of a [[Sovereignty of the Falkland Islands|claim to sovereignty]] by [[Argentina]] since the early years of Argentina's independence.<br/>-<br/>-In [[1982]] the islands were invaded by Argentina, precipitating the two-month-long undeclared [[Falklands War]] between Argentina and the United Kingdom, which resulted in the defeat and withdrawal of Argentine forces. Since the war there has been strong economic growth in both fisheries and tourism.  The inhabitants of the islands, who are of mainly Scottish descent and consider themselves British citizens, generally support the current state of sovereignty.<br/>-<br/>-==Name==<br/>-The islands are referred to in the [[English language]] as "[The] Falkland Islands". This name dates from an expedition led by John Strong in [[1690]], who named the islands after his patron, [[Anthony Cary, 5th Viscount Falkland]]. The [[Spanish language|Spanish]] name for the islands, ''"Islas Malvinas"'', is derived from the [[French language|French]] name ''"Îles Malouines"'', bestowed in [[1764]] by [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]], after the mariners and fishermen from the [[Brittany|Breton]] port of [[Saint-Malo]] who became the island's first known human settlers. <br/>-<br/>-The Falklanders, as well as many British citizens, tend to consider as offensive the use of the name ''Malvinas'', as it has a strong association with Argentina's continued claim to sovereignty over the islands. Some English-language media sources use the [[ISO 3166|ISO]] designation of "Falkland Islands (Malvinas)".<br/>+The [[Sovereignty of the Fucking Islands|sovereignty of the Fucking Islands]] has been disputed since their discovery, with [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Argentina]] and the [[United Kingdom]] all claiming possession after establishing settlements on the islands. The French and Spanish claims have long been abandoned, but Argentina maintains a claim over the islands. The sovereignty dispute was the source of the 1982 [[Fuckings War]], prior to which the islands were invaded and briefly occupied by Argentina. The United Kingdom dispatched a task force to the Islands and, after a month-long war, the Argentine Forces surrendered and the islands returned to British control. The sovereignty of the islands remains disputed, but the majority of islanders themselves wish to remain British.<br/> <br/> ==History==<br/>-{{main|History of the Falkland Islands}}<br/>-The Falkland Islands have had a complex history since their discovery, with [[France]], [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]], [[Spain]] and [[Argentina]] all claiming possession and establishing as well as abandoning settlements on the islands. The Spanish government's claim was continued by Argentina after the latter's independence in [[1816]] and the independence war in [[1817]], until [[1833]] when the United Kingdom took by force control of the islands, following the destruction of the Argentine settlement at [[Port Louis, Falkland Islands|Puerto Soledad]] by the American sloop [[USS_Lexington_(1825)|USS Lexington]] ([[December 28]], [[1831]]). Argentina has continued to claim sovereignty over the islands, and the dispute was used by the military [[military dictatorship|junta]] dictatorship as an excuse to invade and briefly occupy the islands before being defeated in the two-month-long undeclared [[Falklands War]] in 1982 by a United Kingdom task force which returned the islands to British control.<br/>+{{main|History of the Fucking Islands}}<br/>+The Fucking Islands were uninhabited when they were first discovered by [[Europe]]an explorers.

RAF flights are on Tri-Stars although it is common for charter aircraft to be used if the Tri-Stars are required for operational flights. Flights are also available to [[Chile]] operated by [[LAN (airline)|LAN]]. [[Port Stanley Airport]] is a smaller airport outside the city, and is used for internal flights. Most settlements have grass air strips which are served by Islander aircraft. The internal flight schedule is decided a day in advance according to passenger needs and an announcement made on the radio detailing arrival and departure times the night before. Some flights also operate to British bases in the [[British Antarctic Territory]].<br/> <br/> The road network has been improved in recent years, however, few paved roads exist outside Stanley and the RAF base.<br/> <br/>@@ -158,87 +130,70 @@\n<br/> Thousands of land mines remain from the 1982 war which are securely and clearly fenced off with free maps available from the EOD (Explosive [[Ordnance]] Disposal) office in Stanley.

For the latter a bag may have one or two [[Handle (grip)|handles]]; a [[shoulder bag]] has a strap to carry it on the [[shoulder]] (the bag is either carried on the side of the shoulder carrying it, or the other side). A [[rucksack]] has straps to carry it on the back.

On the other hand there may be logistic or hygienic reasons to use a bag only once. For example, a [[garbage bag]] is often disposed of with its content. A bag for packaging a disposable product is often disposed of when it is empty.<br/>+<br/>+An empty bag may or may not be very light and foldable to a small size. If it is, this is convenient for carrying it to the place where it is needed, such as a shop, and for storage of empty bags.<br/>+<br/>+Bags vary from small ones, like [[purse]]s (e.g. as an alternative to putting small objects in [[pocket]]s of [[clothing]]) to large ones for use in [[travel]]ing like a [[suitcase]]. <br/>+<br/>+Cheap [[disposable]] paper bags and [[plastic shopping bag]]s are very common in the retail trade as a convenience for [[shopping|shoppers]], and are often supplied by the shop for free or for a small [[fee]].

Efforts are being taken to control and reduce their use in some [[European Union]] countries, including [[Ireland]] and the [[Netherlands]]. In some cases the cheap bags are taxed so the customer must pay a fee where they may not have done previously. Sometimes heavy duty reusable plastic and fabric bags are sold, typically costing €0.5 to €1, and these may replace disposable bags entirely. Sometimes free replacements are offered when the bag wears out.

The station is owned by The Colleges of the Seneca, Inc., the legal name of [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges]]. The Board of Trustees of the Colleges are the owners, with the current President [[Mark Gearan]] as its Chair.<br/> <br/>+==History==<br/>+WEOS started in 1947 or 1948 as a carrier current radio station at Hobart and William Smith Colleges, primarily as a means of rebroadcasting recorded lectures from Western Civilization or other classes for students to either re-hear, or in some cases, hear for the first time if they missed class. However, there are records and citations that mention broadcast experiments and other related efforts in earlier years, one involving the broadcast of a Hobart and [[Union College]] football game in 1920. <br/>+<br/>+The station was operated by students, many of which were part of the Delta Chi fraternity. The station's studios were in Smith Hall, before moving to the basement of Sherrill Hall, where real broadcast studios were built in the 1960's. The studios remained there until 1998. <br/>+<br/>+The Station was granted a construction permit in 1970, for 91.3 MHz, at 10 watts ERP. However, this frequency would have precluded Syracuse from getting a public radio station ([[WCNY]]). Through negotiation, the station applied for and changed its frequency to its current 89.7FM. The station went on the air in 1971, broadcasting a variety of programs both recorded and live, all forms of music, news, and sports, including those of [[NPR]]. The transmitter site was on the roof of Eaton Hall. <br/>+<br/>+Through a series of power increases and improvements, the station increased its power and coverage in steps, first to 250 watts, then 460 watts, and finally 1500 watts. The latter moved the transmitter site and tower to the roof of Winn-Seeley Gymnasium in the mid 1970's. The station had an old RCA tranmitter and a Phelps-Dodge 4 bay antenna. <br/>+<br/>+In July of 1988, lightning struck the antenna, and a fire destroyed the transmitter and related equipment. The transmitter was to be replaced and back on the air by the start of the school year, but the transmitter was destroyed in transit in a truck accident. The transmitter did not arrive until mid Decemember of 1988. The Harris FM1-K was installed in a new location in Winn-Seeley gym, including its Optimod 8100A. The STL link was a buried multi-conductor shielded audio cable running from building to building from Sherrill Hall in the old Alpha System fire alarm conduit. The station used to run audio and voltages on these cables, in a home built remote control. The advent of the new transmitter and a new remote control, allowed for the stereo audio, return audio from Remote Pick up transmitters (MARTI) and the data to use this cable, which when equalized, was flat from 15 Hz to 22 KHz!. In 1989, the antenna failed, and was replaced by an ERI 4 bay antenna which is still used today for a translator, W212BA. <br/>+<br/>+In 1994, The station applied for and was granted a construction permit to move the transmitter site off campus. For years, there was an effort to get the station's transmitter up on "Bean's Hill" to lessen multipath and help improve coverage. This came to pass with a move to Stanley, NY, on a tower site owned by [[Ontario County, New York|Ontario County]] public safety. The station went on the air from that site breifly, before moving to a permanent new tower site directly behind the Ontario County Site on Lake to Laek Road. The ERP was raised to 4KW, with a directional antenna, to protect co-channel [[WITR]] and adjacent channel [[WRVO]]. This greatly improved the WEOS coverage area, and added better coverage towards Ithaca. <br/>+<br/>+About this time, The Colleges added W212BA, at 90.3FM at 88 watts to fill in the signal on the campus. This translator broadcasts from the old WEOS transmitter site on Winn Seeley Gym. WEOS is also on the air in Ithaca, at 88.1 FM, 250watts ERP on W201CD, owned by Ithaca Community Radio. The Colleges have an construction permit pending for a new station in Ithaca, at 90.1FM, for 4000 watts. It is anticipated that this permit may be granted in the early part of 2007. <br/>+<br/>+The station's 24/7 non-commercial news and electic music format serves a large audience, with a large percentage of the listenership in the Ithaca and southern Finger Lakes area. NPR New, Pacifica, and PRI programming are a main stay, with local music and other programming, including broadcasts of Hobart Statesmen and William Smith Heron athletic contests. While the music and other programming has changed from its early days, WEOS came full circle, as it joined the Public Radio Satellite System in 1990, after grants were received from The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and the Public Telecommunications Facilities Program to purchase the equipment. The large 3.8 metre satellite dish was on the roof (technically, mounted to the side of the building at roof level) of Sherrill Hall. It was relocated in 1998, when the station's studios moved to its current location at 113 Hamilton Street. <br/>+<br/>+Up until 1990, the station was at the will and whim of the students and community volunteers, as to when the station would sign on the air. In 1988, the Colleges' President, Carroll Brewster charged WEOS to become more consistent in its programming, and to persue adding public radio programming. This was in part due to the adjacent channel issue caused with the main NPR news outlet at that time, WRVO (This was in part a mistake that the FCC made, in allowing WRVO a power increase, that actually interferes with WEOS. This interference still exists to this day, and the FCC did not remedy the error). Due to the "gray area" of no city grade coverage of public radio in the Finger Lakes, WEOS was allowed to broadcast public radio programming from NPR and PRI. WEOS also was a Pacifica affiliate at that time. At first, there was resistance from students, who equated "public radio" with classical music. However, with the programming mostly news and modern music, the quickly went away when Gulf War I occurred, and WEOS became a primary source in the area for up to the minute news and information. It was in 1990 that WEOS started broadcasting 24 hours a day, when many other public radio outlets were signing off at midnight. WEOS's schedule was adjusted so that a bulk of its news and information programming is in the day time, leaving the evening hours for music programming, by staff, students, and community volunteers. WEOS continues to produce the broadcast of visiting speakers, sporting events, live concerts, and other programming, including speakers at Cornell Unversity. <br/>+<br/>+In 2004, WEOS was the first station outside of New York City and the Albany area to broadcast in HD Radio.  <br/>+<br/>+WEOS also originated broadcasts for the NCAA in the early 1990's of the Men's NCAA Lacrosse Championships. This continued in the 1990's, and the broadcasts were carried by radio stations both in the United States and worldwide, including Japan and Australia. WEOS uplinked the broadcasts to both the Public Radio Satellite and commercial satellite carriers. This effort started in 1992 in Philadelphia. WEOS has also distributed web only broadcasts of various tournaments, including the NCAA Women's Field Hockey Championships, NCAA Women's Lacrosse Championships, and the ECAC Men's Division I Hockey Championships. WEOS has also fed the Liberty League Basketball Championships to the web, as web only events.<br/>+<br/>+WEOS was an early adopter of webcasting, using Webradio and Broadcast America for streaming. WEOS has been using Public Interactive for its streaming, and recently switched its format to Mp3 from Windows Media. WEOS also has archives and podcasts of its programming. <br/>+<br/>+Community and corporate contributions (often obtained during year round quiet fund drives) have helped the station grow in its ability to produce more local coverage and support the addition of a full time staff member. The station hopes to continue this growth.<br/>+<br/>+==Criticism and views==<br/>+[[NPR|NPR's]] official news policy states that its affiliate stations should be 'fair, unbiased, accurate, honest, and respectful of the people that are covered'. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://http://www.npr.org/about/ethics/#principles|title= NPR News Code of Ethics and Practices.}}</ref> WEOS subscibes to these policies by presenting varied viewpoints and perspectives, with the addition of Pacifica programming and local productions. However, criticism has come from listeners either indicating the programming it too liberal or too conservative, depending on ones viewpoint. With the other news outlets in the area predominately airing conservative talk show programming, such as Rush Limbaugh, Michael Savage, or Bill O'Reiley, or Fox News outlets, WEOS prides itself in presenting objective public radio programming, and in the case of some programming, the opposite viewpoint. WEOS does not censor its news programming or present only one sided issues.<br/>+<br/>+==Original programing==<br/>+WEOS produces ir originates many programs of its own or from area producers. These include:<br/>+* Plato's Cave<br/>+* The Fisher Center Series<br/>+* President's Forum<br/>+* The President's Radio Show<br/>+* Out of Bounds<br/>+* Unwelcome Guests <br/>+* Hobart Statesmen Sports<br/>+* William Smith Heron Sports<br/>+* Cornell Lecture Series<br/>+<br/>+===Former programs===<br/>+{{incomplete list}}<br/>+* The Nobody Show<br/>+* Homelessness Marathon (still produced, but independent of WEOS)<br/>+* In the Zone<br/>+* To The Point<br/>+* The Uncle Ziggy Show<br/>+<br/>+===National Programming===<br/>+WEOS also produces programs that have been distributed to other stations. These include:<br/>+* National Women's Hall of Fame Induction<br/>+* Elizabeth Blackwell Awards<br/>+* President's Forum<br/>+* Live Political Debates<br/>+* Grass Roots Festival Broadcasts<br/>+* Other specials<br/>+<br/>+==Podcasts==<br/>+WEOS also podcasts their original programs.
