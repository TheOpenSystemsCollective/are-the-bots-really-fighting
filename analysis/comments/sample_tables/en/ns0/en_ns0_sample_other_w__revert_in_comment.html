Active for a short period from 1996 to 1998, The Firm included four [[New York]] rappers -- [[Nas (rapper)|Nas]], [[Foxy Brown]], [[AZ (rapper)|AZ]], and [[Nature (artist)|Nature]] -- but was actually the pet project of its producers: Nas Escobar (as he referred to himself at the time), [[Steve Stoute|Steve "Commissioner" Stoute]], [[Dr. Dre]], and the [[Trackmasters]].<br/>-<br/>-An early form of the Firm appeared on "Affirmative Action," a standout song from Nas' second album, ''[[It Was Written]]''. Foxy Brown, AZ, and [[Cormega]] joined Nas for the song&mdash;each taking a verse&mdash;and it became an album highlight as well as a much-talked-about song on the streets. Of course, Cormega got the boot in favor of Nature for reasons that vary depending on who you ask (reportedly because either Stoute or Nas&mdash;or both&mdash;preferred Nature, or that Mega would not sign a contract with Stoute). Up until this incident, Cormega and Nas had been comrades. Following the incident, however, Cormega took his beef to the streets, penning the inflammatory track "Fuck Nas and Nature" and letting it circulate through the mix-tape market. Things would never be the same between the two former comrades, even after their short-lived truce in 2001, which ended in Nas' dissing Mega on the song "Destroy & Rebuild" from 2001's ''[[Stillmatic]]''.<br/>-<br/>-Dre and the Trackmasters split the production duties, and Stoute brought in a number of guests to pad the album, most likely hoping to spin off successful careers for several of the newcomers.<br/>-<br/>-The album sold well despite lacking a charting single, but was not critically successful, and each Firm member went back to their respective solo careers, rarely speaking about The Firm.

In 2003 under Arista Records, Lupe dropped the single "Pop Pop" where he presented himself as a gangsta rapper with lyrics glorifying both gun use and jewels.

The relationship between the two began when representatives from the brand saw photos of Lupe wearing a cap from their skateboarding line, [[DGK]], in the [[Chicago Tribune]]. When the two came into contact, Fiasco asked for some DGK products on the strength that he advertised for the brand. {{fact}} The company looked at the hype surrounding his name, his relationship with the director of Global Marketing for RbK International, and the fact that he was a sneaker enthusiast. {{fact}} Soon after, Lupe was invited to a few of the parties the company had thrown. {{fact}} The deal was a major accomplishment for the Chicago native, considering that apart from the other musicians on the Reebok roster, he was the only person to have not had an album released. Lupe was then tapped to be a part of the "O.G" marketing campaign, where Hip Hop artists such as [[Lil' Wayne]] and [[Mike Jones]] all designed their own personal colorway of the Reebok "O.G" model. {{fact}} He designed a white/grey model of the shoe, which is currently sold in footwear stores in malls across the world.

The music featured on the show is mostly hip-hop and many of the songs played are either his own, of the artists on his label "1st and 15th", personal favorites, or gag records. In between playing music, discussions are held on issues ranging from politics, music, sports, entertainment, etc. Also, 45 minutes into the show, a contest called the "freshen up package" is held where three questions are made up, and the first person to call in with the correct answers successfully, wins the prize(s). <br/>+In the past prizes have ranged from clothing packages, skateboarding items, CDs, etc. FNF radio is scheduled to air every Monday at 11:00 pm EST.<br/>+<br/>+==Personal life==<br/>+Lupe Fiasco is the youngest of four brothers. He has five sisters. His father was a prolific African drummer, and his mother was a gourmet chef. Lupe began to [[Hip hop music|rap]] when he was in the 8th grade, but began to pursue it fully when he turned 17.  He is highly influenced by [[Crucial Conflict]] and [[Nas]] among others. Lupe regards ''[[It Was Written]]'' as one of his favorite albums and cites it as his primary source inspiration. For instance, when asked of his influences in an interview with AllHipHop.com, Lupe stated the following: <i>"You know I really tried to go back and recreate [Nas'] It Was Written, you know what I'm saying like that?

For me, I just look at it like I studied a master piece. I modeled my album after a master piece; and not song for song; not line for line; not beat for beat. It was more-for me it was like mood for mood. The way he set the mood on that album to me was just like incredible. And at the time in my life-like, I fell in love with `It Was Written' when I was seventeen, eighteen-a very impressionable time-so I was like I love that album.

The play is one of Shakespeare's most popular and is widely performed across the world. <br/>+<br/>+== Date and sources ==<br/>+It is not known exactly when ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' was written or first performed, but, on the basis of topical references and an allusion to [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser's]] ''Epithalamion'', it is usually dated in 1595 or 1596. Some have theorized that the play might have been written for an aristocratic wedding; numerous such weddings took place in 1596, while others suggest it was written for the Queen to celebrate the feast day of St. John, but no concrete evidence exists to link the play with either of them. In either case, it would also have been performed at [[The Theatre]], and, later, [[Globe Theatre|The Globe]] in [[London]].<br/>+<br/>+There is no known source for the plot of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'', although individual elements can be traced to classical literature; for example, the story of [[Pyramus and Thisbe]] is told in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' and the transformation of Bottom into an [[donkey|ass]] is descended from [[Apuleius]]' ''[[The Golden Ass]]''; Shakespeare would have studied both texts at school. In addition, Shakespeare could have been working on ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' at about the same time that he wrote the ''Dream'', and it is possible to see Pyramus and Thisbe as a comic reworking of the tragic play.<br/>+A further, frequently ignored source is ''[[The Knight's Tale]]'' in [[Chaucer]]'s [[Canterbury Tales]].<sup>[http://www.shakespeare-online.com/sources/mssources.html]</sup><br/>+<br/>+==Performance and publication==<br/>+The play was entered into the [[Stationers' Register|Register]] of the [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers|Stationers Company]] on Oct. 8, [[1600]] by the bookseller Thomas Fisher, who published the [[first quarto]] edition later that year. A [[second quarto]] was printed in [[1619]] by William Jaggard, as part of his so-called [[False Folio]]. The play next appeared in print in the [[First Folio]] of [[1623]].<br/>+<br/>+The title page of [[first quarto|Q1]] states that the play was "sundry times publicly acted" prior to 1600. The first performance known with certainty occurred at Court on Jan. 1, 1604.<br/>+<br/>+During the years  of the [[Puritan]] [[English Interregnum|Interregnum]] when the theatres were closed (1642-60), the comic subplot of Bottom and his compatriots was performed as a "droll." Drolls were comical playlets, often adapted from the subplots of Shakespearean and other plays, that could be attached to the acts of acrobats and jugglers and other allowed performances, thus circumventing the ban against drama.<br/>+<br/>+When the theatres re-opened in 1660, ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' was acted in adapted form, like many other Shakespearean plays. [[Samuel Pepys]] saw it on Sept. 29, 1662, and thought it "The most insipid, ridiculous play that ever I saw...."<ref>F. E.

In response, Egeus quotes before Theseus an ancient Athenian law whereby a daughter must marry the suitor chosen by her father, or else face death or lifelong chastity worshipping [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] as a [[nun]]. Hermia and her lover Lysander therefore decide to elope by escaping through the forest at night. Hermia informs her best friend Helena, but Helena has recently been rejected by Demetrius and decides to win back his favor by revealing the plan to him. Demetrius, followed doggedly by Helena, chases Hermia, who, in turn, chases Lysander, from whom she becomes separated.<br/>+<br/>+Meanwhile, [[Oberon (Fairy King)|Oberon]], king of the fairies, and his queen, [[Titania (Fairy Queen)|Titania]], arrive in the same forest to attend Theseus and Hippolyta's wedding. Oberon and Titania are estranged because Titania refuses to give her Indian page-boy to Oberon for use as his "Knight" or "henchman," since the child's mother was one of Titania's worshippers. Oberon seeks to punish Titania's disobedience and recruits the mischievous [[Puck (Shakespeare)|Puck]] (also called [[Hobgoblin]] and [[Robin Goodfellow]]) to help him apply a magical juice from a flower called "love-in-idleness," which makes the victim fall in love with the first living thing he sees when he awakens.  Oberon applies the juice to Titania in order to distract her and force her to give up the page-boy.<br/>+<br/>+Having seen Demetrius act cruelly toward Helena, Oberon orders Puck to spread some of the juice on the eyelids of the young Athenian man.  Instead, Puck puts the juice on the eyes of Lysander, who then falls in love with Helena.  When Oberon finds this out, he makes Puck apply the juice to Demetrius. Due to Puck's errors, Hermia's two lovers temporarily turn against her in favor of Helena.  Helena, however, is convinced that her two suitors are mocking her, as neither loved her originally. The four pursue and quarrel with each other all night, losing themselves in the dark and in the maze of their romantic entanglements.  <br/>+<br/>+Meanwhile, a band of "rude mechanicals" (lower-class labourers) have arranged to perform a crude play about [[Pyramus and Thisbe]] for Theseus's wedding, and venture into the forest, near Titania's [[bower]], for their rehearsal. [[Nick Bottom]], a stage-struck [[weaver]], is spotted by Puck, who transforms his head into that of an ass (donkey). Titania is awoken by Bottom's singing, and she immediately falls in love with him. She treats him as if he is a nobleman and lavishes attention upon him. While in this state of devotion, she encounters Oberon and casually gives him the Indian boy. <br/>+<br/>+Having achieved his goals, Oberon releases Titania and orders Puck to remove the ass's head from Bottom. The magical enchantment is removed from Lysander but is allowed to remain on Demetrius, so that he may reciprocate Helena's love. The fairies then disappear, and Theseus and Hippolyta arrive on the scene, during an early morning hunt. They wake the lovers and, since Demetrius doesn't love Hermia anymore, Theseus over-rules Egeus's demands and arranges a group wedding. The lovers decide that the night's events must have been a dream. After they all exit, Bottom awakes, and he too decides that he must have experienced a dream "past the wit of man."<br/>+<br/>+In Athens, Theseus, Hippolyta and the lovers watch the mechanicals perform "Pyramus and Thisbe." It is ridiculous and badly performed but gives everyone pleasure regardless, and after the mechanicals dance a [[Bergomask]] (rustic dance), everyone retires to bed. Finally, as night falls, Oberon and Titania bless the house, its occupants, and the future children of the newlyweds, and Puck delivers an epilogue to the audience asking for applause.<br/>+<br/>+==The ''Dream'' on the stage==<br/>+After the Jacobean/Caroline era, ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' was never performed in its entirety until the [[1840s]]. Instead, it was heavily adapted in forms like [[Henry Purcell]]'s musical masque/play ''[[The Fairy Queen]]'' (1692). Richard Leveridge turned the Pyramus and Thisbe scenes into an Italian opera burlesque, acted at [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]] in 1716. John Frederick Lampe elaborated upon Leveridge's version in 1745. Charles Johnson had used the Pyramus and Thisbe material in the finale of ''Love in a Forest'', his 1723 adaptation of ''[[As You Like It]].''  In 1755, [[David Garrick]] did the opposite of what had been done a century earlier: he extracted Bottom and his companions and acted the rest, in an adaptation called ''The Fairies.'' Frederic Reynolds produced an operatic version in 1816.<ref>Halliday, pp. 255, 271, 278, 316-17, 410.</ref><br/>+<br/>+===The Victorian ''Dream''===<br/>+In 1840, [[Lucia Elizabeth Vestris|Madame Vestris]] at [[Covent Garden]] returned the play to the stage with a relatively full text, but padded it out greatly with musical sequences and balletic dances. Vestris took the role of Oberon, and for the next seventy years, Oberon and [[Puck (Shakespeare)|Puck]] would always be played by women. After the success of Vestris' production, [[nineteenth century theatre]] continued to treat the ''Dream'' as an opportunity for huge spectacle, often with a cast numbering nearly one hundred. Huge, detailed sets were created for the palace and the forest, and the fairies tended to be envisaged as gossamer-winged ballerinas. The much-loved overture by [[Felix Mendelssohn]] was always used throughout this period, with the text often being cut to provide greater space for music and dance.<br/>+<br/>+[[Augustin Daly's]] production opened in 1895 in London and ran for 21 performances. The special effects were constructed by the famous [[Martinka]] Magic Company, which was later owned by [[Houdini]].<br/>+<br/>+[[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] staged a 1911 production with live rabbits.<br/>+<br/>+===Granville-Barker, Max Reinhardt and after===<br/>+In the early [[twentieth century]], a reaction against this huge spectacle emerged. Innovative director [[Harley Granville-Barker]] introduced in 1914 the modern way of staging the ''Dream'': he removed the huge casts and Mendelssohn, using instead Elizabethan folk music. He replaced the huge sets with a simple system of patterned curtains. He used a completely original vision of the fairies, seeing them as golden robotic insectoid creatures based on [[Cambodia]]n idols. This increased simplicity and emphasis on directorial imagination has dominated subsequent ''Dreams'' on the stage.<br/>+<br/>+[[Max Reinhardt (theatre director)|Max Reinhardt]] staged ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' thirteen times between 1905 and 1934, introducing a revolving set. After he fled Germany he devised a more spectacular outdoor version at the [[Hollywood Bowl]], in September 1934. The shell was removed and replaced by a "forest" planted in tons of dirt hauled in especially for the event, and a trestle was constructed from the hills to the stage. The wedding procession inserted between Acts IV and V crossed a trestle with torches down the hillside. The cast included [[John Davis Lodge]], [[William Farnum]], [[Sterling Holloway]], 18-year-old [[Olivia de Havilland]], and [[Mickey Rooney]], with [[Erich Wolfgang Korngold]]'s orchestrations of Mendelssohn. (The young Austrian composer would go on to make a Hollywood career.) On the strength of this production, [[Warner Brothers]] signed Reinhardt to direct a filmed version, Hollywood's first Shakespeare event since Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford's ''[[Taming of the Shrew]]'' (1929). Rooney (Puck) and De Havilland (Hermia) were the only hold-overs from the cast.<br/>+<br/>+*[http://www.laphil.org/resources/piece_detail.cfm?id=1372 Los Angeles Philharmonic notes]<br/>+*[http://www.courttheatre.org/home/plays/9899/midsummer/PNmidsummer.shtml Notes, including production history]<br/>+<br/>+===Brook and after===<br/>+Another landmark production was that of [[Peter Brook]] in 1970. Brook swept away every tradition associated with the play, staging it in a blank white box, in which masculine fairies engaged in [[circus (performing arts)|circus]] tricks such as [[trapeze]] artistry. Brook also introduced the subsequently popular idea of doubling Theseus/Oberon and Hippolyta/Titania, as if to suggest that the world of the fairies is a mirror version of the world of the mortals.<br/>+Since Brook's production, directors have felt free to use their imaginations freely to decide for themselves what the play's story means, and to represent that visually on stage. In particular, there has been an increased amount of sexuality on stage, as many directors see the 'palace' as a symbol of restraint and repression, while the 'wood' can be a symbol of wild, unrestrained sexuality, which is both liberating and terrifying.<br/>+<br/>+==Film adaptations==<br/>+:''See also [[Shakespeare on screen#A Midsummer Night's Dream]]<br/>+The Shakespeare play has inspired several movies.  The following are the best known. <br/>+<br/>+*'''[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0026714/ 1935]''' - directed by [[Max Reinhardt (theatre director)|Max Reinhardt]] and [[William Dieterle]], produced by [[Henry Blanke]] and adapted by [[Charles Kenyon]] and [[Mary C.

Brown (comedian)|Joe E. Brown]] as [[Francis Flute]], [[Dick Powell]] as [[Lysander (Shakespeare)|Lysander]] and [[Victor Jory]] as [[Oberon (Fairy King)|Oberon]]. Many of the actors in this version had never performed Shakespeare, and never would do so again, notably Cagney and Brown, who were nevertheless highly acclaimed for their performances in the film. All critics agreed that Dick Powell, who played Lysander, was horribly miscast, and Powell himself agreed. <ref>Eckert, Charles W., ed. [[Focus on Shakespearean Films]], p. 48 Watts, Richard W.

The full 132 minute version was not seen again until it turned up on [[cable television]] in 1994.

A typical blog combines text, images, and links to other blogs, web pages, and other media related to its topic. Most blogs are primarily textual although some focus on [[photograph]]s ([[photoblog]]), [[video]]s ([[vlog]]), or [[audio]] ([[podcasting]]), and are part of a wider network of [[social media]].<br/>+<br/>+The word ''blog'' can also be used as a verb, meaning ''to maintain or add content to a blog.''<br/>+<br/>+== History ==<br/>+[[Chronicle]]s, [[commonplace]]s, [[personal journal|diaries]], and [[perzine]]s can all be seen as predecessors of blogs.<br/>+<br/>+Before blogging became popular, digital communities took many forms, including [[Usenet]], [[electronic mailing list|e-mail lists]] and [[bulletin board system]]s (BBS). In the 1990s, [[Internet forum]] software, such as [[WebEx]], created running conversations with "threads". Threads are topical connections between messages on a metaphorical "corkboard".<br/>+<br/>+=== 1994 – 2001 ===<br/>+{{Main|Online diary}}<br/>+[[Image:Brad Fitzpatrick.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Brad Fitzpatrick]], an early blogger.]]<br/>+The modern blog evolved from the [[online diary]] where people would keep a running account of their personal lives. Most such writers called themselves diarists, [[journalist]]s, or journalers. A few called themselves [[escribitionist]]s. The Open Pages [[webring]] included members of the online-journal community. [[Justin Hall]], who began eleven years of personal blogging in 1994 while a student at [[Swarthmore College]], is generally recognized as one of the earliest bloggers.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/02/20/MNGBKBEJO01.DTL|title=Time to get a life — pioneer blogger Justin Hall bows out at 31|publisher=SFgate|date=2005-02-20|accessdate=2006-06-09}}</ref><br/>+<br/>+Other forms of journals kept online also existed. A notable example was game programmer [[John Carmack|John Carmack's]] widely read journal, published via the [[finger protocol]]. Websites, including both corporate sites and [[personal homepage]]s, had and still often have "What's New" or "News" sections, often on the [[home page|index page]] and sorted by date. One example of a news based "weblog" is the [http://drudgereport.com/ "Drudge Report"] founded by the self styled maverick reporter [[Matt Drudge]], though apparently Drudge dislikes this classification. One noteworthy early precursor to a blog was the [[tongue-in-cheek]] personal website that was frequently updated by [[Usenet]] legend [[Kibo]].<br/>+<br/>+Early weblogs were simply manually updated components of common [[website]]s. However, the evolution of tools to facilitate the production and maintenance of web articles posted in said chronological fashion made the publishing process feasible to a much larger, less technical, population. Ultimately, this resulted in the distinct class of online publishing that produces blogs we recognize today. For instance, the use of some sort of browser-based software is now a typical aspect of "blogging". blogs can be hosted by dedicated [[blog hosting service]]s, or they can be run using [[blog software]], such as [[blogger (service)|blogger]] or [[LiveJournal]], or on regular [[web hosting service]]s, such as [[DreamHost]].<br/>+<br/>+The term "weblog" was coined by [[Jorn Barger]] on [[17 December]] [[1997]]. The short form, "blog," was coined by Peter Merholz, who jokingly broke the word ''weblog'' into the phrase ''we blog'' in the sidebar of his blog Peterme.com in April or May of 1999.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/surveys/displaystory.cfm?story_id=6794172|title=It's the links, stupid|publisher=[[The Economist]]|date=2006-4-20|accessdate=2006-07-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/19991013021124/http://peterme.com/index.html|title=Peterme.com|author=Peter Merholz|publisher=[[The Internet Archive]]|date=1999|accessdate=2006-07-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kottke.org/03/08/its-weblog-not-web-log|author=[[Jason Kottke]]|title=kottke.org|date=August 26, 2003|accessdate=2006-07-21}}</ref> This was quickly adopted as both a noun and verb ("to blog," meaning "to edit one's weblog or to post to one's weblog").<br/>+<br/>+After a slow start, blogging rapidly gained in popularity: the site [[Xanga]], launched in 1996, had only 100 diaries by 1997, but over 50,000,000 as of December 2005. Blog usage spread during 1999 and the years following, being further popularized by the near-simultaneous arrival of the first hosted blog tools:<br/>+* [[Open Diary]] launched in October 1998, soon growing to thousands of online diaries. Open Diary innovated the reader comment, becoming the first blog community where readers could add comments to other writers' blog entries.<br/>+* [[Brad Fitzpatrick]] started [[LiveJournal]] in March 1999.<br/>+* Andrew Smales created [[Pitas.com]] in July 1999 as an easier alternative to maintaining a "news page" on a website, followed by [[Diaryland]] in September 1999, focusing more on a personal diary community.<ref>Jensen, Mallory [http://www.cjr.org/issues/2003/5/blog-jensen.asp?printerfriendly=yes A Brief History of Weblogs]</ref><br/>+* [[Evan Williams (blogger)|Evan Williams]] and [[Meg Hourihan]] ([[Pyra Labs]]) launched [[blogger.com]] in August 1999 (purchased by [[Google]] in February 2003)<br/>+<!-- * Paul Kedrosky's [[GrokSoup]] -- EXPAND OR DELETE? --><br/>+<br/>+Blogging combined the personal web page with tools to make linking to other pages easier &mdash; specifically [[permalink]]s, [[blogroll]]s and [[TrackBack]]s. This, together with [[List of search engines#blog search engines|weblog search engines]] enabled bloggers to track the threads that connected them to others with similar interests.<br/>+<br/>+=== 2001 – 2004 ===<br/>+Several broadly popular American blogs emerged in 2001: [[Andrew Sullivan]]'s AndrewSullivan.com, [[Ron Gunzburger]]'s [[Politics1.com]], Taegan Goddard's [[Political Wire]] and [[Jerome Armstrong]]'s [[MyDD]] — all blogging primarily on [[political blog|politics]] (two earlier popular American political blogs were Bob Somerby's [[Daily Howler]] launched in 1998 and [[Mickey Kaus]]' Kausfiles launched in 1999).<br/>+<br/>+By 2001, blogging was enough of a phenomenon that how-to manuals began to appear, primarily focusing on technique. The importance of the blogging community (and its relationship to larger society) increased rapidly. Established schools of [[journalism]] began researching blogging and noting the differences between journalism and blogging.<br/>+<br/>+In 2002, Jerome Armstrong's friend and sometime [[business]] partner [[Markos Moulitsas Zúniga]] began [[Daily Kos|DailyKos]]. With up to a million visits a day during peak events, it has now become one of the Internet's most trafficked blogs.<br/>+<br/>+Also in 2002, many blogs focused on comments by [[United States Senate Majority Leader|U.S. Senate Majority Leader]] [[Trent Lott]]. Senator Lott, at a party honoring [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Strom Thurmond]], praised Senator Thurmond by suggesting that the United States would have been better off had Thurmond been elected president. Lott's critics saw these comments as a tacit approval of [[racial segregation]], a policy advocated by Thurmond's [[U.S. presidential election, 1948|1948 presidential campaign]]. This view was reinforced by documents and recorded interviews dug up by bloggers. (See [[Josh Marshall]]'s ''[[Talking Points Memo]]''.) Though Lott's comments were made at a public event attended by the media, no major media organizations reported on his controversial comments until after blogs broke the story.  Blogging helped to create a political crisis that forced Lott to step down as majority leader.<br/>+<br/>+The impact of this story gave greater credibility to blogs as a medium of news dissemination. Though often seen as partisan gossips, bloggers sometimes lead the way in bringing key information to public light, with mainstream media having to follow their lead. More often, however, news blogs tend to react to material already published by the mainstream media.<br/>+<br/>+Since 2002, blogs have gained increasing notice and coverage for their role in breaking, shaping, and [[Spin (public relations)|spinning]] [[news]] stories. The [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq war]] saw bloggers taking measured and passionate points of view that go beyond the traditional [[left-right politics|left-right]] divide of the [[political spectrum]].<br/>+<br/>+Blogging by established politicians and political candidates, to express opinions on war and other issues, cemented blogs' role as a news source. (See [[Howard Dean]] and [[Wesley Clark]].) Meanwhile, an increasing number of experts blogged, making blogs a source of in-depth analysis. (See Daniel Drezner and [[J. Bradford DeLong]].)<br/>+<br/>+The second Iraq war was the first "blog war" in another way: Iraqi bloggers gained wide readership, and one, [[Salam Pax]], published a book of his blog. Blogs were also created by soldiers serving in the Iraq war. Such "[[warblog]]" gave readers new perspectives on the realities of war, as well as often offering different viewpoints from those of official news sources.<br/>+<br/>+Blogging was used to draw attention to obscure news sources. For example, bloggers posted links to traffic cameras in Madrid as a huge anti-terrorism demonstration filled the streets in the wake of the [[11 March 2004 Madrid attacks|March 11 attacks]].<br/>+<br/>+Bloggers began to provide nearly-instant commentary on televised events, creating a secondary meaning of the word "blogging": to simultaneously transcribe and [[Editorial|editorialize]] speeches and events shown on television. (For example, "I am blogging Rice's testimony" means "I am posting my reactions to [[Condoleezza Rice|Condoleezza Rice's]] testimony into my blog as I watch her on television.") Real-time commentary is sometimes referred to as "liveblogging."<br/>+<br/>+=== 2004 – present ===<br/>+[[Image:Wordpress main theme.png|thumb|300px|A [[WordPress]] test blog running [[Kubrick (Wordpress theme)|Kubrick]].]]<br/>+In 2004, the role of blogs became increasingly mainstream, as [[political consultant]]s, news services and candidates began using them as tools for outreach and opinion forming. Even politicians not actively campaigning, such as the [[Labour Party (UK)|UK's Labour Party's]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Tom Watson (politician)|Tom Watson]], began to blog to bond with constituents.<br/>+<br/>+[[Minnesota Public Radio]] broadcast a program by [[Christopher Lydon]] and [[Matt Stoller]] called "The blogging of the President," which covered a transformation in politics that blogging seemed to presage. The ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'' began regular coverage of blogs and blogging. Anthologies of blog pieces reached print, and blogging personalities began appearing on radio and television. In the summer of 2004, both United States [[Democratic National Convention|Democratic]] and [[Republican National Convention|Republican]] Parties' conventions credentialed bloggers, and blogs became a standard part of the publicity arsenal. Mainstream television programs, such as [[Chris Matthews]]' ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews|Hardball]]'', formed their own blogs. [[Merriam-Webster]]'s Dictionary declared "blog" as the word of the year in 2004.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/blog_declared_Word_of_the_Year Wikinews|publisher=Wikinews|title=blog declared Word of the Year|date=2004-12-01|accessdate=2006-06-22}}</ref><br/>+<br/>+Blogs were among the driving forces behind the "[[Rathergate]]" scandal, to wit: (television journalist) Dan Rather presented documents (on the CBS show ''[[60 Minutes]]'') that conflicted with accepted accounts of [[President Bush's military service]] record. Bloggers declared the documents to be [[forgery|forgeries]] and presented evidence and arguments in support of that view, and CBS apologized for what it said were inadequate reporting techniques (see [[Little Green Footballs]]). Many bloggers view this scandal as the advent of blogs' acceptance by the mass media, both as a source of news and opinion and as means of applying political pressure.<br/>+<br/>+Some bloggers have moved over to other media. The following bloggers (and others) have appeared on radio and television: [[Atrios|Duncan Black]] (known widely by his pseudonym, Atrios), [[Glenn Reynolds]] ([[Instapundit]]) , [[Markos Moulitsas Zúniga]] ([[Daily Kos]]), [[Alex Steffen]] ([[Worldchanging]]) and [[Ana Marie Cox]] ([[Wonkette]]). [[Hugh Hewitt]] is an example of a media personality who has moved in the other direction, adding to his reach in "old media" by being an influential blogger.<br/>+<br/>+Some blogs were an important source of news during the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|December 2004 Tsunami]] such as [[Medecins Sans Frontieres]], which used SMS text messaging to report from affected areas in Sri Lanka and Southern India.<br/>+<br/>+In the [[United Kingdom]], ''[[The Guardian]]'' [[newspaper]] launched a redesign in September 2005, which included a daily digest of blogs on page 2.

Technorati provides current information on both popular searches and [[tag]]s used to categorize blog postings.<br/>+<br/>+== Business models ==<br/>+{{unsourced}}<br/>+While the great majority of blogs are non-commercial, full-time bloggers have struggled to find a way to make a profit from their work. The most common and simplest method is to accept targeted [[web banner|banner advertising]]. However, some bloggers have been hesitant to use this because of negative reader response to the ads. A more discreet form of advertising is for bloggers to promote merchandise from other sites, receiving a commission when a customer buys the item after following a blog link.<br/>+<br/>+Others have tried a [[click-to-donate]] model. Prominent political blogger [[Andrew Sullivan]] claimed at one point that accepting voluntary donations to his blog was more lucrative than his magazine work for [[The New Republic]]. Following the practice of public television, Sullivan boosted donations with periodic "[[pledge drives]]," one of which was reported to net him $120,000. Sullivan's attempt at securing corporate sponsorship for his blog fell apart after strong negative reader response to the deal.<br/>+<br/>+No other high-profile blogger has accepted a single corporate sponsor since Sullivan's failed deal. However, In the early twenty-first century, many magazines and newspapers began sponsoring personal blogs by their employees. The business model in this case is essentially the same as that of a traditional newspaper columnist. In a creative extension of the model, employees at other media companies began blogs focusing on the companies' products. For example, many actors in pornography blog about their work on company sites, creating a sense of personal connection between consumer and product.<br/>+<br/>+== Anatomy of a blog entry ==<br/>+[[Image:Typical blog.png|thumb|250px|A [[screenshot]] of a typical blog.]]<br/>+A variety of different systems are used to create and maintain blogs. Dedicated [[web application]]s can eliminate the need for bloggers to manage this software. With web interfaces, these systems allow travelers to blog from anywhere on the Internet, and allow users to create blogs without having to maintain their own server. Such systems allow users to work with tools such as Ecto, Elicit and [[Blogger (service)|Blogger]] which allow users to maintain their Web-hosted blog without the need to be online while composing or editing posts. Blog creation tools and blog hosting are also provided by some Web hosting companies ([[Tripod]]), Internet service providers ([[America Online]]), online publications ([[Salon.com]]) and internet portals ([[Yahoo! 360°]] or [[Google]]). Some advanced users have developed custom blogging systems from scratch using [[Server-side scripting|server-side]] software, and often implement membership management and password protected areas. Others have created a mix of a blog and wiki, called a [[bliki]].<br/>+<br/>+A blog entry typically consists of the following:<br/>+* ''Title'', the main title, or headline, of the post.<br/>+* ''Body'', main content of the post.<br/>+* ''[[Permalink]]'', the [[URL]] of the full, individual article.<br/>+* ''Post Date'', date and time the post was published.<br/>+<br/>+A blog entry optionally includes the following:<br/>+* ''Comments''<br/>+* ''Categories'' (or [[tag]]s) - subjects that the entry discusses<br/>+* ''[[Trackback]]'' and or ''[[pingback]]'' - links to other sites that refer to the entry<br/>+<br/>+=== Comments ===<br/>+{{main|Feedback comment system}}<br/>+<br/>+Comments are a way to provide discussion on blog entries. Readers can leave a [[comment]] on a post, which can correct errors or contain their opinion on the post or the post's subject. Services like [[coComment]] aim to ease discussion through comments, by allowing tracking of them.<br/>+<br/>+== Blog popularity ==<br/>+Recently, researchers have analyzed the dynamics of how blogs become popular. There are essentially two measures of this: popularity through citations, as well as popularity through affiliation (i.e. [[blogroll]]). The basic conclusion from studies of the structure of blogs is that while it takes time for a blog to become popular through blogrolls, permalinks can boost popularity more quickly, and are perhaps more indicative of popularity and authority than blogrolls, since they denote that people are actually reading the blog's content and deem it valuable or noteworthy in specific cases.<ref>Marlow, C.

Presented at the International Communication Association Conference, May, 2004, New Orleans, LA.</ref><br/>+<br/>+The [[blogdex]] project was launched by researchers in the [[MIT Media Lab]] to crawl the web and gather data from thousands of blogs in order to investigate their social properties. It gathered this information for over 4 years, and autonomously tracked the most contagious information spreading in the blog community. The project is no longer active.<br/>+<br/>+Blogs are also given rankings by [[Technorati]] based on the amount of incoming links and [[Alexa Internet]] based on the web hits of Alexa Toolbar users.

Some institutions see blogging as a means of "getting around the filter" and pushing [[messages]] directly to the public. Some critics worry that bloggers respect neither [[copyright]] nor the role of the [[mass media]] in presenting society with credible news.<br/>+<br/>+Bloggers' credibility problem, however, can be an advantage for the bloggers and for the mainstream journalists who take an interest in them. News organizations are sometimes reluctant to tell stories that will upset important people. But when bloggers or activists make sensational claims, then they become stories themselves, and journalists can use them as cover for reporting the underlying scandals.<br/>+<br/>+Many mainstream journalists, meanwhile, write their own blogs -- well over 300, according to CyberJournalist.net's J-blog list. The first known use of a Weblog on a news site was in August 1998, when [[Jonathan Dube]] of The [[Charlotte Observer]] published one chronicling Hurricane Bonnie.<ref>{{cite news|title=blogging Bonnie.|work=Poynter.org|date=18 September, 2003 |url=http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=52&aid=48413/}}</ref><br/>+<br/>+Blogs have also had an influence on [[minority language]]s, bringing together scattered speakers and learners; this is particularly so with blogs in [[Goidelic language|Gaelic languages]], whose creators can be found as far away from traditional Gaelic areas as [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Alaska]]. Minority language publishing (which may lack economic feasibility) can find its audience through inexpensive blogging.<br/>+<br/>+== Legal issues ==<br/>+The emergence of blogging has brought a range of legal liabilities. Employers have "[[dooce]]d" (fired) employees who maintain personal blogs that discuss their employers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/11/03/airline_blogger_sacked/|title=Queen of the Sky gets marching orders|publisher=The Register|date=2004-11-03|accessdate=2006-06-23}}</ref> The major areas of concern are the issues of proprietary or confidential information, and defamation. Several cases have been brought before the national courts against bloggers and the courts have returned with mixed verdicts. In ''John Doe v. Patrick Cahill'', the [[Delaware Supreme Court]] held that stringent standards had to be met to unmask anonymous bloggers, and also took the unusual step of dismissing the libel case itself (as unfounded under American libel law) rather than referring it back to the [[trial court]] for reconsideration. In a bizarre twist, the Cahills were able to find the ISP address of John Doe, who turned out to be the person they suspected: the town's mayor, Councilman Cahill's political rival. The Cahills amended their original complaint, and the mayor settled the case rather than going to trial. <ref>[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data2/delawarestatecases/266-2005.pdf "John Doe No. 1 v.

A typical blog combines text, images, and links to other blogs, web pages, and other media related to its topic. Most blogs are primarily textual although some focus on [[photograph]]s ([[photoblog]]), [[video]]s ([[vlog]]), or [[audio]] ([[podcasting]]), and are part of a wider network of [[social media]].<br/>-<br/>-The word ''blog'' can also be used as a verb, meaning ''to maintain or add content to a blog.''<br/>-<br/>-== History ==<br/>-[[Chronicle]]s, [[commonplace]]s, [[personal journal|diaries]], and [[perzine]]s can all be seen as predecessors of blogs.<br/>-<br/>-Before blogging became popular, digital communities took many forms, including [[Usenet]], [[electronic mailing list|e-mail lists]] and [[bulletin board system]]s (BBS). In the 1990s, [[Internet forum]] software, such as [[WebEx]], created running conversations with "threads". Threads are topical connections between messages on a metaphorical "corkboard".<br/>-<br/>-=== 1994 – 2001 ===<br/>-{{Main|Online diary}}<br/>-[[Image:Brad Fitzpatrick.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Brad Fitzpatrick]], an early blogger.]]<br/>-The modern blog evolved from the [[online diary]] where people would keep a running account of their personal lives. Most such writers called themselves diarists, [[journalist]]s, or journalers. A few called themselves [[escribitionist]]s. The Open Pages [[webring]] included members of the online-journal community. [[Justin Hall]], who began eleven years of personal blogging in 1994 while a student at [[Swarthmore College]], is generally recognized as one of the earliest bloggers.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/02/20/MNGBKBEJO01.DTL|title=Time to get a life — pioneer blogger Justin Hall bows out at 31|publisher=SFgate|date=2005-02-20|accessdate=2006-06-09}}</ref><br/>-<br/>-Other forms of journals kept online also existed. A notable example was game programmer [[John Carmack|John Carmack's]] widely read journal, published via the [[finger protocol]]. Websites, including both corporate sites and [[personal homepage]]s, had and still often have "What's New" or "News" sections, often on the [[home page|index page]] and sorted by date. One example of a news based "weblog" is the [http://drudgereport.com/ "Drudge Report"] founded by the self styled maverick reporter [[Matt Drudge]], though apparently Drudge dislikes this classification. One noteworthy early precursor to a blog was the [[tongue-in-cheek]] personal website that was frequently updated by [[Usenet]] legend [[Kibo]].<br/>-<br/>-Early weblogs were simply manually updated components of common [[website]]s. However, the evolution of tools to facilitate the production and maintenance of web articles posted in said chronological fashion made the publishing process feasible to a much larger, less technical, population. Ultimately, this resulted in the distinct class of online publishing that produces blogs we recognize today. For instance, the use of some sort of browser-based software is now a typical aspect of "blogging". blogs can be hosted by dedicated [[blog hosting service]]s, or they can be run using [[blog software]], such as [[blogger (service)|blogger]] or [[LiveJournal]], or on regular [[web hosting service]]s, such as [[DreamHost]].<br/>-<br/>-The term "weblog" was coined by [[Jorn Barger]] on [[17 December]] [[1997]]. The short form, "blog," was coined by Peter Merholz, who jokingly broke the word ''weblog'' into the phrase ''we blog'' in the sidebar of his blog Peterme.com in April or May of 1999.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/surveys/displaystory.cfm?story_id=6794172|title=It's the links, stupid|publisher=[[The Economist]]|date=2006-4-20|accessdate=2006-07-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/19991013021124/http://peterme.com/index.html|title=Peterme.com|author=Peter Merholz|publisher=[[The Internet Archive]]|date=1999|accessdate=2006-07-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kottke.org/03/08/its-weblog-not-web-log|author=[[Jason Kottke]]|title=kottke.org|date=August 26, 2003|accessdate=2006-07-21}}</ref> This was quickly adopted as both a noun and verb ("to blog," meaning "to edit one's weblog or to post to one's weblog").<br/>-<br/>-After a slow start, blogging rapidly gained in popularity: the site [[Xanga]], launched in 1996, had only 100 diaries by 1997, but over 50,000,000 as of December 2005. Blog usage spread during 1999 and the years following, being further popularized by the near-simultaneous arrival of the first hosted blog tools:<br/>-* [[Open Diary]] launched in October 1998, soon growing to thousands of online diaries. Open Diary innovated the reader comment, becoming the first blog community where readers could add comments to other writers' blog entries.<br/>-* [[Brad Fitzpatrick]] started [[LiveJournal]] in March 1999.<br/>-* Andrew Smales created [[Pitas.com]] in July 1999 as an easier alternative to maintaining a "news page" on a website, followed by [[Diaryland]] in September 1999, focusing more on a personal diary community.<ref>Jensen, Mallory [http://www.cjr.org/issues/2003/5/blog-jensen.asp?printerfriendly=yes A Brief History of Weblogs]</ref><br/>-* [[Evan Williams (blogger)|Evan Williams]] and [[Meg Hourihan]] ([[Pyra Labs]]) launched [[blogger.com]] in August 1999 (purchased by [[Google]] in February 2003)<br/>-<!-- * Paul Kedrosky's [[GrokSoup]] -- EXPAND OR DELETE? --><br/>-<br/>-Blogging combined the personal web page with tools to make linking to other pages easier &mdash; specifically [[permalink]]s, [[blogroll]]s and [[TrackBack]]s. This, together with [[List of search engines#blog search engines|weblog search engines]] enabled bloggers to track the threads that connected them to others with similar interests.<br/>-<br/>-=== 2001 – 2004 ===<br/>-Several broadly popular American blogs emerged in 2001: [[Andrew Sullivan]]'s AndrewSullivan.com, [[Ron Gunzburger]]'s [[Politics1.com]], Taegan Goddard's [[Political Wire]] and [[Jerome Armstrong]]'s [[MyDD]] — all blogging primarily on [[political blog|politics]] (two earlier popular American political blogs were Bob Somerby's [[Daily Howler]] launched in 1998 and [[Mickey Kaus]]' Kausfiles launched in 1999).<br/>-<br/>-By 2001, blogging was enough of a phenomenon that how-to manuals began to appear, primarily focusing on technique. The importance of the blogging community (and its relationship to larger society) increased rapidly. Established schools of [[journalism]] began researching blogging and noting the differences between journalism and blogging.<br/>-<br/>-In 2002, Jerome Armstrong's friend and sometime [[business]] partner [[Markos Moulitsas Zúniga]] began [[Daily Kos|DailyKos]]. With up to a million visits a day during peak events, it has now become one of the Internet's most trafficked blogs.<br/>-<br/>-Also in 2002, many blogs focused on comments by [[United States Senate Majority Leader|U.S. Senate Majority Leader]] [[Trent Lott]]. Senator Lott, at a party honoring [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Strom Thurmond]], praised Senator Thurmond by suggesting that the United States would have been better off had Thurmond been elected president. Lott's critics saw these comments as a tacit approval of [[racial segregation]], a policy advocated by Thurmond's [[U.S. presidential election, 1948|1948 presidential campaign]]. This view was reinforced by documents and recorded interviews dug up by bloggers. (See [[Josh Marshall]]'s ''[[Talking Points Memo]]''.) Though Lott's comments were made at a public event attended by the media, no major media organizations reported on his controversial comments until after blogs broke the story.  Blogging helped to create a political crisis that forced Lott to step down as majority leader.<br/>-<br/>-The impact of this story gave greater credibility to blogs as a medium of news dissemination. Though often seen as partisan gossips, bloggers sometimes lead the way in bringing key information to public light, with mainstream media having to follow their lead. More often, however, news blogs tend to react to material already published by the mainstream media.<br/>-<br/>-Since 2002, blogs have gained increasing notice and coverage for their role in breaking, shaping, and [[Spin (public relations)|spinning]] [[news]] stories. The [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq war]] saw bloggers taking measured and passionate points of view that go beyond the traditional [[left-right politics|left-right]] divide of the [[political spectrum]].<br/>-<br/>-Blogging by established politicians and political candidates, to express opinions on war and other issues, cemented blogs' role as a news source. (See [[Howard Dean]] and [[Wesley Clark]].) Meanwhile, an increasing number of experts blogged, making blogs a source of in-depth analysis. (See Daniel Drezner and [[J. Bradford DeLong]].)<br/>-<br/>-The second Iraq war was the first "blog war" in another way: Iraqi bloggers gained wide readership, and one, [[Salam Pax]], published a book of his blog. Blogs were also created by soldiers serving in the Iraq war. Such "[[warblog]]" gave readers new perspectives on the realities of war, as well as often offering different viewpoints from those of official news sources.<br/>-<br/>-Blogging was used to draw attention to obscure news sources. For example, bloggers posted links to traffic cameras in Madrid as a huge anti-terrorism demonstration filled the streets in the wake of the [[11 March 2004 Madrid attacks|March 11 attacks]].<br/>-<br/>-Bloggers began to provide nearly-instant commentary on televised events, creating a secondary meaning of the word "blogging": to simultaneously transcribe and [[Editorial|editorialize]] speeches and events shown on television. (For example, "I am blogging Rice's testimony" means "I am posting my reactions to [[Condoleezza Rice|Condoleezza Rice's]] testimony into my blog as I watch her on television.") Real-time commentary is sometimes referred to as "liveblogging."<br/>-<br/>-=== 2004 – present ===<br/>-[[Image:Wordpress main theme.png|thumb|300px|A [[WordPress]] test blog running [[Kubrick (Wordpress theme)|Kubrick]].]]<br/>-In 2004, the role of blogs became increasingly mainstream, as [[political consultant]]s, news services and candidates began using them as tools for outreach and opinion forming. Even politicians not actively campaigning, such as the [[Labour Party (UK)|UK's Labour Party's]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Tom Watson (politician)|Tom Watson]], began to blog to bond with constituents.<br/>-<br/>-[[Minnesota Public Radio]] broadcast a program by [[Christopher Lydon]] and [[Matt Stoller]] called "The blogging of the President," which covered a transformation in politics that blogging seemed to presage. The ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'' began regular coverage of blogs and blogging. Anthologies of blog pieces reached print, and blogging personalities began appearing on radio and television. In the summer of 2004, both United States [[Democratic National Convention|Democratic]] and [[Republican National Convention|Republican]] Parties' conventions credentialed bloggers, and blogs became a standard part of the publicity arsenal. Mainstream television programs, such as [[Chris Matthews]]' ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews|Hardball]]'', formed their own blogs. [[Merriam-Webster]]'s Dictionary declared "blog" as the word of the year in 2004.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/blog_declared_Word_of_the_Year Wikinews|publisher=Wikinews|title=blog declared Word of the Year|date=2004-12-01|accessdate=2006-06-22}}</ref><br/>-<br/>-Blogs were among the driving forces behind the "[[Rathergate]]" scandal, to wit: (television journalist) Dan Rather presented documents (on the CBS show ''[[60 Minutes]]'') that conflicted with accepted accounts of [[President Bush's military service]] record. Bloggers declared the documents to be [[forgery|forgeries]] and presented evidence and arguments in support of that view, and CBS apologized for what it said were inadequate reporting techniques (see [[Little Green Footballs]]). Many bloggers view this scandal as the advent of blogs' acceptance by the mass media, both as a source of news and opinion and as means of applying political pressure.<br/>-<br/>-Some bloggers have moved over to other media. The following bloggers (and others) have appeared on radio and television: [[Atrios|Duncan Black]] (known widely by his pseudonym, Atrios), [[Glenn Reynolds]] ([[Instapundit]]) , [[Markos Moulitsas Zúniga]] ([[Daily Kos]]), [[Alex Steffen]] ([[Worldchanging]]) and [[Ana Marie Cox]] ([[Wonkette]]). [[Hugh Hewitt]] is an example of a media personality who has moved in the other direction, adding to his reach in "old media" by being an influential blogger.<br/>-<br/>-Some blogs were an important source of news during the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|December 2004 Tsunami]] such as [[Medecins Sans Frontieres]], which used SMS text messaging to report from affected areas in Sri Lanka and Southern India.<br/>-<br/>-In the [[United Kingdom]], ''[[The Guardian]]'' [[newspaper]] launched a redesign in September 2005, which included a daily digest of blogs on page 2. Also in June 2006, [[BBC News]] launched a weblog for its editors, following other news companies <ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/5116654.stm|title=Down with blogs... so here's another|first=Dawn|last=Wilson|date=2006-06-26|accessdate=2006-06-26|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref>.<br/>-<br/>-In January 2005, ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine listed eight bloggers that business people "could not ignore": [[Engadget|Peter Rojas]], [[Xeni Jardin]], [[Ben Trott]], [[Mena Trott]], [[Jonathan I.

Blogs, either used internally to enhance the communication and culture in a [[corporation]] or externally for [[marketing]], [[branding]] or [[Public relations|PR]] purposes are called [[corporate blog]]s.<br/>-<br/>-;[[List of search engines#blog search engines|Blog search engines]]: Several blog search engines are used to search blog contents (also known as the [[blogosphere]]), such as [[blogdigger]], [[Feedster]], and [[Technorati]]. Technorati provides current information on both popular searches and [[tag]]s used to categorize blog postings.<br/>-<br/>-== Business models ==<br/>-{{unsourced}}<br/>-While the great majority of blogs are non-commercial, full-time bloggers have struggled to find a way to make a profit from their work. The most common and simplest method is to accept targeted [[web banner|banner advertising]]. However, some bloggers have been hesitant to use this because of negative reader response to the ads. A more discreet form of advertising is for bloggers to promote merchandise from other sites, receiving a commission when a customer buys the item after following a blog link.<br/>-<br/>-Others have tried a [[click-to-donate]] model. Prominent political blogger [[Andrew Sullivan]] claimed at one point that accepting voluntary donations to his blog was more lucrative than his magazine work for [[The New Republic]]. Following the practice of public television, Sullivan boosted donations with periodic "[[pledge drives]]," one of which was reported to net him $120,000. Sullivan's attempt at securing corporate sponsorship for his blog fell apart after strong negative reader response to the deal.<br/>-<br/>-No other high-profile blogger has accepted a single corporate sponsor since Sullivan's failed deal. However, In the early twenty-first century, many magazines and newspapers began sponsoring personal blogs by their employees. The business model in this case is essentially the same as that of a traditional newspaper columnist. In a creative extension of the model, employees at other media companies began blogs focusing on the companies' products. For example, many actors in pornography blog about their work on company sites, creating a sense of personal connection between consumer and product.<br/>-<br/>-== Anatomy of a blog entry ==<br/>-[[Image:Typical blog.png|thumb|250px|A [[screenshot]] of a typical blog.]]<br/>-A variety of different systems are used to create and maintain blogs. Dedicated [[web application]]s can eliminate the need for bloggers to manage this software. With web interfaces, these systems allow travelers to blog from anywhere on the Internet, and allow users to create blogs without having to maintain their own server. Such systems allow users to work with tools such as Ecto, Elicit and [[Blogger (service)|Blogger]] which allow users to maintain their Web-hosted blog without the need to be online while composing or editing posts. Blog creation tools and blog hosting are also provided by some Web hosting companies ([[Tripod]]), Internet service providers ([[America Online]]), online publications ([[Salon.com]]) and internet portals ([[Yahoo! 360°]] or [[Google]]). Some advanced users have developed custom blogging systems from scratch using [[Server-side scripting|server-side]] software, and often implement membership management and password protected areas. Others have created a mix of a blog and wiki, called a [[bliki]].<br/>-<br/>-A blog entry typically consists of the following:<br/>-* ''Title'', the main title, or headline, of the post.<br/>-* ''Body'', main content of the post.<br/>-* ''[[Permalink]]'', the [[URL]] of the full, individual article.<br/>-* ''Post Date'', date and time the post was published.<br/>-<br/>-A blog entry optionally includes the following:<br/>-* ''Comments''<br/>-* ''Categories'' (or [[tag]]s) - subjects that the entry discusses<br/>-* ''[[Trackback]]'' and or ''[[pingback]]'' - links to other sites that refer to the entry<br/>-<br/>-=== Comments ===<br/>-{{main|Feedback comment system}}<br/>-<br/>-Comments are a way to provide discussion on blog entries. Readers can leave a [[comment]] on a post, which can correct errors or contain their opinion on the post or the post's subject. Services like [[coComment]] aim to ease discussion through comments, by allowing tracking of them.<br/>-<br/>-== Blog popularity ==<br/>-Recently, researchers have analyzed the dynamics of how blogs become popular. There are essentially two measures of this: popularity through citations, as well as popularity through affiliation (i.e. [[blogroll]]). The basic conclusion from studies of the structure of blogs is that while it takes time for a blog to become popular through blogrolls, permalinks can boost popularity more quickly, and are perhaps more indicative of popularity and authority than blogrolls, since they denote that people are actually reading the blog's content and deem it valuable or noteworthy in specific cases.<ref>Marlow, C.

It gathered this information for over 4 years, and autonomously tracked the most contagious information spreading in the blog community.

Some institutions see blogging as a means of "getting around the filter" and pushing [[messages]] directly to the public. Some critics worry that bloggers respect neither [[copyright]] nor the role of the [[mass media]] in presenting society with credible news.<br/>-<br/>-Bloggers' credibility problem, however, can be an advantage for the bloggers and for the mainstream journalists who take an interest in them. News organizations are sometimes reluctant to tell stories that will upset important people. But when bloggers or activists make sensational claims, then they become stories themselves, and journalists can use them as cover for reporting the underlying scandals.<br/>-<br/>-Many mainstream journalists, meanwhile, write their own blogs -- well over 300, according to CyberJournalist.net's J-blog list. The first known use of a Weblog on a news site was in August 1998, when [[Jonathan Dube]] of The [[Charlotte Observer]] published one chronicling Hurricane Bonnie.<ref>{{cite news|title=blogging Bonnie.|work=Poynter.org|date=18 September, 2003 |url=http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=52&aid=48413/}}</ref><br/>-<br/>-Blogs have also had an influence on [[minority language]]s, bringing together scattered speakers and learners; this is particularly so with blogs in [[Goidelic language|Gaelic languages]], whose creators can be found as far away from traditional Gaelic areas as [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Alaska]]. Minority language publishing (which may lack economic feasibility) can find its audience through inexpensive blogging.<br/>-<br/>-== Legal issues ==<br/>-The emergence of blogging has brought a range of legal liabilities.

Several cases have been brought before the national courts against bloggers and the courts have returned with mixed verdicts. In ''John Doe v. Patrick Cahill'', the [[Delaware Supreme Court]] held that stringent standards had to be met to unmask anonymous bloggers, and also took the unusual step of dismissing the libel case itself (as unfounded under American libel law) rather than referring it back to the [[trial court]] for reconsideration. In a bizarre twist, the Cahills were able to find the ISP address of John Doe, who turned out to be the person they suspected: the town's mayor, Councilman Cahill's political rival. The Cahills amended their original complaint, and the mayor settled the case rather than going to trial. <ref>[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data2/delawarestatecases/266-2005.pdf "John Doe No. 1 v.

In Sicily, the first inhabitants mentioned in history are the tribes of the [[Sicani]] (Greek ''Sikanoi'') and the [[Siculi]] (Greek ''Sikeloi''), who have given Sicily its more familiar modern name. The triskelion was revived, as a suitably [[Neoclassicism|neoclassic]]&mdash;and non-Bourbon&mdash;emblem for the new Napoleonic Kingdom of the [[Two Sicilies]], by [[Joachim Murat]] in 1808 (''illustration, left'').<br/>+<br/>+[[Pliny the Elder]] attributes the origin of the triskelion of Sicily to the [[triangle (geometry)|triangular]] form of the island, ancient '''Trinacria''', which consists of three large capes equidistant from each other, pointing in their respective directions, the names of which were [[Messina|Pelorus]], [[Pachino|Pachynus]], and [[Marsala|Lilybæum]]. Thus Pliny provided an eminently rational explanation&mdash; but for a symbol that must be older than any [[cartography|cartographic conception]] of the island, surely. Since the triskelion may be associated with a multitude of triads, with new associations cropping up regularly, it is more productive just to look at the symbol itself.<br/>+<br/>+The three legs of the triskelion are reminiscent of Hephaestus' three-legged tables that ran by themselves. They were mentioned in ''[[Iliad]]'' xviii:    <br/>+<br/>+:"At the moment Hephaestus was busily<br/>+:Turning from bellows to bellows, sweating with toil<br/>+:As he laboured to finish a score of three-legged tables<br/>+:To stand around the sides of his firm-founded hall. On each<br/>+:Of the legs he had put a gold wheel, that those magic tables<br/>+:Might cause all to marvel by going with no other help<br/>+:To the gathering of gods and by likewise returning to his house."<br/>+<br/>+==Manx triskelion==<br/>+[[Image:ManxCarRegistrationPlate.jpg|thumb|left|Manx [[license plate|car registration plate]], with the triskelion]]<br/>+In the symbol for the more thoroughly Celtic [[Isle of Man]] in the [[Irish Sea]], the "three legs embowed" of the heraldic triskelion are represented now in armour, "spurred and garnished ''or'' (gold)." <br/>+<br/>+On Manx banknotes, the triskelion appears within a rim containing the Latin inscription ''<small>QUOCUNQUE JECERIS STABIT</small>''  ("Wherever you will throw it, it stands"), which is boldly confident enough, and safely divorced from any pagan connection.  Just how old the triskelion is as a symbol of Man is mooted; it is documented since the thirteenth or fourteenth century at least. The triskelion is alternatively known as the ''tre cassyn'' ("three legs") in [[Manx language|Manx]]. The symbol appears on the Isle of Man's ancient Sword of State, which may have belonged to [[Olaf Godredson]], who became King of the Sudreys (Southern [[Hebrides]] and the Isle of Man) in 1226.<br/>+<br/>+==Spiral triskele==<br/>+[[Image:Triple-Spiral-Symbol.png|right|thumb|150px|The [[triple spiral]] symbol]]<br/>+[[Image:Triskele-Symbol-spiral-five-thirds-turns.png|right|thumb|150px|Spiral triskelion, occasionally used as a Christian [[Trinitarian]] symbol]]<br/>+<br/>+The [[Celtic art|Celtic]] symbol of three conjoined [[triple spiral|spiral]]s may well have had triple significance similar to the imagery that lies behind the triskelion. That spiral motif is a [[Neolithic]] symbol in Western Europe: it is carved into the rock of a stone lozenge near the main entrance of the prehistoric [[Newgrange]] in County Meath, Ireland. Because of its [[Celt|Celtic]] associations, it is also used as a symbol of [[Brittany]] (alongside the ''[[Hermine#Heraldry|hermine]]'').<br/>+<br/>+In the north of Spain, the triskelion is used as a symbol of [[Galiza|Galizan]] and [[Asturias|Asturian]] nationalists. A similar symbol called ''[[lábaro]]'' by [[Cantabria]]n nationalists can be compared to the neighboring Basque culture's four-branched [[lauburu]].<br/>+<br/>+A possibly related symbol of [[Germanic paganism|Germanic]] origin is the [[Valknut]].<br/>+<br/>+==Third Reich==<br/>+The Third Reich adopted the Celtic triskelion as the insignia for a [[Waffen SS]] division composed of ("Celtic") Belgian volunteers. That has led to an association with the [[swastika]]. It is claimed, possibly apocryphally, that the similarity to the swastika caused confusion or distress amongst some [[Jew|Jewish]] refugees interned on the [[Isle of Man]] during [[World War II|World War 2]].<br/>+<br/>+==Modern use==<br/>+=== Neopagans and Reconstructionists ===<br/>+As a [[Celt|Celtic]] symbol, the triskelion, usually consisting of spirals, but also the "horned triskelion", sometimes plays a role in Celtic groups and, rarely, can be seen in use by [[Germanic neopaganism|Germanic neopagan]] groups.  The spiral triskelion is one of the primary symbols of [[Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism]], and also used by some [[Wicca]]ns.  Celtic Reconstructionists use the symbol to represent a variety of triplicities in their cosmology and theology;  it is also a favored symbol due to its association with the god [[Manannan mac Lir|Manannán Mac Lir]].  Wicca is syncretic in nature and often aesthetically adopts symbolism from various cultures, particularly Celtic symbolism. It is less commonly used amongst Germanic neopagan groups due to the non-Germanic origins of the symbol; use by Germanic groups may be due to confusion or association with Norse symbols with triple symmetries, like the [[Valknut]], the [[Triquetra]], or the symbol found on the [[Snoldelev Stone]].<br/>+<br/>+===BDSM===<br/>+A form of the triskelion has been proposed as a [[BDSM Emblem]] by some [[BDSM]] groups, partly based on a description in the ''[[Story of O]]''.  The specific emblem design is meant to be shown with metallic spokes and circle, and three holes (not dots) within the design.<br/>+<br/>+===Political usage of the triskelion===<br/>+A group of racist South African [[Whites]], the [[Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging|AWB]], have used a flag consisting of a red background with a white circle. In the circle, three black [[seven]]s form a design distantly reminiscent of the triskelion. In spite of the similarities to the [[swastika]] (and the overall resemblance to the Nazi flag, both having a black symbol on a white disc on a red background), they claim their flag is inspired by a Biblical meaning of the seven, and the fact that the organisation was founded on the seventh day of the seventh month, 1973 (from which the three 7's can be extracted).<br/>+<br/>+===Modern popular culture===<br/>+====Comics====<br/>+*The Triskelion is the name used for the headquarters of the [[Ultimates]] in the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Marvel Universe]].

Born in [[Brooklyn, New York]], he was signed by the [[Boston Braves]] before the 1950 season. He played for the [[Milwaukee Braves]] (1957-1962), [[Houston Colt .45s]] (1962-1963), [[Cleveland Indians]] (1964-1966), [[Boston Red Sox]] (1966-1967), [[Chicago White Sox]] (1967-1968), [[Detroit Tigers]] (1968-1969), and [[San Francisco Giants]] (1969-1974).<br/>+<br/>+McMahon was used almost exclusively in relief during his 18-year [[MLB]] career.  He appeared in 874 games, just two as a starter, and was one of the [[Major League Baseball|major league]]'s <u>best</u> at what he did during  his era.  He never once spent time on the [[disabled list]], and in the fifteen full seasons that he played (1958-1972), he averaged about 54 games and 81 [[innings pitched]] per year.<br/>+<br/>+He reached the big leagues at the advanced age of 27 after playing [[minor league]] ball for about 5 1/2 years and also spending two years in the military (May 30, 1951-May 17, 1953).

It contains up to 16% [[morphine]], an [[opiate]] [[alkaloid]], which is most frequently processed chemically to produce [[heroin]] for the black market. The resin also includes non-narcotic [[alkaloids]], such as [[papaverine]] and [[noscapine]].  '''Meconium''' historically referred to related, weaker preparations made from other parts of the poppy or different species of poppies.  Modern opium production is the culmination of millennia of production, in which the source poppy, methods of extraction and processing, and methods of consumption have become increasingly potent. <br/>-<br/>-Cultivation of opium poppies for food, [[anaesthesia]], and ritual purposes dates back at least to [[Neolithic]] Europe.  The [[Sumerian]], [[Assyrian]], [[Egyptian]], [[Minoan]], [[Greek]], [[Roman]], and [[Arabic]] Empires each made widespread use of opium, which was the most potent form of [[pain relief]], allowing ancient surgeons to perform prolonged surgical procedures.  Opium is mentioned in the most important medical texts of the ancient world, including the [[Ebers Papyrus]] and the writings of [[Dioscorides]], [[Galen]], and [[Avicenna]].<br/>-<br/>-Recreational use of the drug began in a sexual context in China in the fifteenth century, but was limited by its rarity and expense.  Opium trade became more regular by the seventeenth century, when it was mixed with tobacco for smoking, and addiction was first recognized.  Opium prohibition in China began in 1729, and was followed by a century of exponentially increasing opium use.  British smugglers favored opium as a product cheaply obtained from Indian provinces under British exploitation, which was highly valued and in demand in China.  A massive confiscation of opium by the Chinese led to the first of two [[Opium Wars]] in 1838 and 1860, which won Britain the right to trade opium to every part of China, until more than a quarter of the male population was addicted by 1905.  Recreational or addictive opium use in other nations remained rare into the late nineteenth century, recorded by an ambivalent literature that often praised the drug.<br/>-<br/>-Global regulation of opium began with the stigmatization of Chinese and Indian immigrants and [[opium dens]], leading rapidly from town ordinances in the 1870s to the formation of the [[International Opium Commission]] in 1909.  During this period the portrayal of opium in literature became squalid and violent, British opium trade was largely supplanted by domestic Chinese production, purified [[morphine]] and [[heroin]] became widely available for injection, and [[patent medicines]] containing opiates reached a peak of popularity.  Opium was prohibited in many countries during the early twentieth century, leading to the modern pattern of opium production as a precursor for illegal recreational drugs or tightly regulated legal prescription drugs.  Illicit opium production, now dominated by Afghanistan, has increased steadily in recent years to over 6600 tons yearly.<br/>+'''Opium''' is a [[narcotic]] resin produced from [[Opium poppy|opium poppies]] ''([[Papaver]] somniferum)''.

Active for a short period from 1996 to 1998, The Firm included four [[New York]] rappers -- [[Nas (rapper)|Nas]], [[Foxy Brown]], [[AZ (rapper)|AZ]], and [[Nature (artist)|Nature]] -- but was actually the pet project of its producers: Nas Escobar (as he referred to himself at the time), [[Steve Stoute|Steve "Commissioner" Stoute]], [[Dr. Dre]], and the [[Trackmasters]].<br/>-<br/>-An early form of the Firm appeared on "Affirmative Action," a standout song from Nas' second album, ''[[It Was Written]]''. Foxy Brown, AZ, and [[Cormega]] joined Nas for the song&mdash;each taking a verse&mdash;and it became an album highlight as well as a much-talked-about song on the streets. Of course, Cormega got the boot in favor of Nature for reasons that vary depending on who you ask (reportedly because either Stoute or Nas&mdash;or both&mdash;preferred Nature, or that Mega would not sign a contract with Stoute). Up until this incident, Cormega and Nas had been comrades. Following the incident, however, Cormega took his beef to the streets, penning the inflammatory track "Fuck Nas and Nature" and letting it circulate through the mix-tape market. Things would never be the same between the two former comrades, even after their short-lived truce in 2001, which ended in Nas' dissing Mega on the song "Destroy & Rebuild" from 2001's ''[[Stillmatic]]''.<br/>-<br/>-Dre and the Trackmasters split the production duties, and Stoute brought in a number of guests to pad the album, most likely hoping to spin off successful careers for several of the newcomers.<br/>-<br/>-The album sold well despite lacking a charting single, but was not critically successful, and each Firm member went back to their respective solo careers, rarely speaking about The Firm. In fact the only rapper who seems to be rapping about The Firm is Cormega, probably due to his ongoing feud with Nas.<br/>-<br/>-==Track listing==<br/>-#"Firm Fiasco" (produced by Dr. Dre)<br/>-#"Phone Tap" (featuring and produced by Dr. Dre)<br/>-#"Executive Decision" (produced by Curt Gowdy)<br/>-#"Firm Family" (featuring and produced by Dr. Dre)<br/>-#"Firm All Stars" (featuring Pretty Boy, produced by Trackmasters)<br/>-#"Hardcore" (produced by Trackmasters)<br/>-#"Untouchable" (featuring Wizard, produced by Dr. Dre)<br/>-#"Five Minutes To Flush" (produced by Dr. Dre)<br/>-#"Desparados" (featuring Canibus, produced by Curt Gowdy)<br/>-#"Firm Biz" (featuring Dawn Robinson, produced by L.E.S.)<br/>-#"I'm Leaving" (featuring Noreaga, produced by Trackmasters)<br/>-#"Throw Your Guns" (featuring Half-a-Mil, produced by Trackmasters)<br/>-<br/>-==Album singles==<br/>-{| class="wikitable"<br/>-!

Growing up, Wasalu had the nickname of "Lu", the last part of his first name. The "Lupe" portion is an extension of this nickname, which he borrowed from Chris Jackson, the name of a Colombian friend from school. The "Fiasco" portion came from him simply looking at the song "Firm Fiasco" from the album by the rap group [[The Firm (group)|The Firm]] and liking the way the 'fiasco' looked on paper. <ref>{{cite web<br/>+| url=http://www.soundslam.com/articles/interviews/interviews.php?interviews=in060511lupefi<br/>+| title=Soundslam Interviews - Lupe Fiasco<br/>+| accessdate=2006-07-12<br/>+| last=Fruchter<br/>+| first=Alexander<br/>+| date=<br/>+| publisher=SoundSlam<br/>+| language=English<br/>+}}</ref> Raised on the Westside of Chicago as the youngest of 9 siblings, Lupe developed a taste for art and a sharp artistic sense, which he says he owes to both his parents.

In 2003 under Arista Records, Lupe dropped the single "Pop Pop" where he presented himself as a gangsta rapper with lyrics glorifying both gun use and jewels.  [http://www.mp3.com/features/speakeasy/show_site_blog_entry.html?topic_id=124602]  During this time, he also had  guest appearances on singles from [[Tha' Rayne]] (2002's "[[Kiss Me (Tha' Rayne song)|Kiss Me]]" and 2003's "[[Didn't You Know]] and [[K Fox]] (2003's "This Life"), then Arista folded in 2004 and Lupe was signed to [[Atlantic Records]]. [[Jay-Z]], emcee and current president of [[Def Jam Records]], was so impressed with Lupe that he offered to sign him to [[Def Jam]] records (around the time of [[The Blueprint]] & [[The Black Album]]), but Lupe declined, having already started 1st and 15th. [[Jay-Z]] decided to assist him in the production of his album.<ref>{{cite web<br/>+| url=http://www.nobodysmiling.com/hiphop/interview/84943.php<br/>+| title=NobodySmiling.com Lupe Fiasco<br/>+| accessdate=<br/>+| last=<br/>+| first=<br/>+| date=<br/>+| publisher=NobodySmiling<br/>+| language=English <br/>+}}</ref><br/>+<br/>+==Endorsements==<br/>+In January 2006, Lupe signed with major footwear and apparel corporation [[Reebok|RBK]], also known as [[Reebok]]. The relationship between the two began when representatives from the brand saw photos of Lupe wearing a cap from their skateboarding line, [[DGK]], in the [[Chicago Tribune]]. When the two came into contact, Fiasco asked for some DGK products on the strength that he advertised for the brand. {{fact}} The company looked at the hype surrounding his name, his relationship with the director of Global Marketing for RbK International, and the fact that he was a sneaker enthusiast. {{fact}} Soon after, Lupe was invited to a few of the parties the company had thrown. {{fact}} The deal was a major accomplishment for the Chicago native, considering that apart from the other musicians on the Reebok roster, he was the only person to have not had an album released. Lupe was then tapped to be a part of the "O.G" marketing campaign, where Hip Hop artists such as [[Lil' Wayne]] and [[Mike Jones]] all designed their own personal colorway of the Reebok "O.G" model. {{fact}} He designed a white/grey model of the shoe, which is currently sold in footwear stores in malls across the world. Lupe and the rest of O.G. artists now grace magazine ads and billboards across the world.<br/>+<br/>+==Radio==<br/>+In early 2006, Lupe and personal friend/hypeman Dusean [[Bishop G]] Dunbar started up ''FNF Radio'', a college radio show broadcast online from WIIT, a college radio station located at the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]]. The show is reported to have, on average, close to 6,000 listeners a night. The music featured on the show is mostly hip-hop and many of the songs played are either his own, of the artists on his label "1st and 15th", personal favorites, or gag records. In between playing music, discussions are held on issues ranging from politics, music, sports, entertainment, etc. Also, 45 minutes into the show, a contest called the "freshen up package" is held where three questions are made up, and the first person to call in with the correct answers successfully, wins the prize(s). <br/>+In the past prizes have ranged from clothing packages, skateboarding items, CDs, etc. FNF radio is scheduled to air every Monday at 11:00 pm EST.<br/>+<br/>+==Personal life==<br/>+Lupe Fiasco is the youngest of four brothers. He has five sisters. His father was a prolific African drummer, and his mother was a gourmet chef. Lupe began to [[Hip hop music|rap]] when he was in the 8th grade, but began to pursue it fully when he turned 17.  He is highly influenced by [[Crucial Conflict]] and [[Nas]] among others. Lupe regards ''[[It Was Written]]'' as one of his favorite albums and cites it as his primary source inspiration. For instance, when asked of his influences in an interview with AllHipHop.com, Lupe stated the following: <i>"You know I really tried to go back and recreate [Nas'] It Was Written, you know what I'm saying like that? [I would play] It Was Written and then I would play my album, and it was like, `Do we got [this] record, do we got that record?'<i>" [http://www.allhiphop.com/features/?ID=1319]<br/>+<br/>+In a following interview with Nobody Smiling:<br/>+<br/>+{{cquote|<b>NobodySmiling.com :</b> <i>Now you've said many times that your album is modeled after `It Was Written,' and a lot of people wouldn't admit that because a lot people would be like He's biting or whatever. So why do you feel so comfortable admitting that?<i><br/>+<br/>+<b>Lupe Fiasco :</b> <i>Cause it's a classic. Like, people study-you study the masters, you know what I'm saying? Everybody that's rapping studied someone to learn how to rap. They had a rapper who was they favorite rapper that they wanted to be like and wanted to rap like, know what I'm saying? For me, I just look at it like I studied a master piece. I modeled my album after a master piece; and not song for song; not line for line; not beat for beat. It was more-for me it was like mood for mood. The way he set the mood on that album to me was just like incredible. And at the time in my life-like, I fell in love with `It Was Written' when I was seventeen, eighteen-a very impressionable time-so I was like I love that album. That's my favorite Hip Hop album, so it's like why not base your album on `It Was Written?'}}</i>[http://www.nobodysmiling.com/hiphop/interview/86446.php]<br/>+<br/>+Lupe has been open about his [[Islam|Islamic faith]], showcasing it in his critically acclaimed underground remix of friend and collaborator [[Kanye West]]'s "[[Jesus Walks]]", entitled "[[Muhammad Walks]]".

When playing, Gilberto occasionally drops into the centre of defence to cover the central defenders, usually [[Lucimar Ferreira da Silva|Lúcio]] for Brazil and [[Kolo Touré]] for Arsenal, who are both known for their attacking runs forward with the ball. Gilberto's style of defending is unlike that of normal midfield enforcers.

In practice, "tolerance" indicates support for practices that prohibit ethnic and religious [[discrimination]]. Conversely, 'intolerance' may be used to refer to the discriminatory practices sought to be prohibited. Though developed to refer to the [[religious toleration]] of minority religious sects following the [[Protestant Reformation]], these terms are increasingly used to refer to a wider range of tolerated practices and groups, or of political parties or ideas widely considered objectionable.<ref>http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Toleration</ref><br/>-<br/>-The concept of toleration is controversial. For one, "toleration" does not raise the level of an actual [[principle]] or [[ethic]], such as other concepts (respect, [[Ethic of reciprocity|reciprocity]], love) do. [[liberalism|Liberal]] critics may see in it an inappropriate implication that the "tolerated" custom or behavior is an [[aberration]] or that authorities have a right to [[punishment|punish]] difference; such critics may instead emphasise notions such as [[Civic virtue|civility]], [[pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]], or respect. Other critics may regard a narrow definition of 'tolerance' as more useful, since it does not require a false [[expression]] of enthusiasm for groups or practices which are genuinely disapproved of.<br/>-<br/>-As a practical matter, governments have always had to consider the question of which groups and practices to tolerate and which to persecute. The [[Edicts of Ashoka]] issued by [[Ashoka the Great]] in the [[Maurya Empire]] declared ethnic and religious tolerance. The later expanding [[Roman Empire]] faced the question of whether or to what extent practices or beliefs could be tolerated or vigorously persecuted. Likewise, during the [[Middle Ages]], the rulers of [[Christendom|Christian Europe]] or the [[Islamic Golden Age|Muslim Middle East]] sometimes extended toleration to minority religious groups, and sometimes did not. Jews in particular suffered under [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] persecutions in medieval [[Europe]].<ref name="Vartan">Vartan Gregorian, "Islam: A Mosaic, Not a Monolith", Brookings Institution Press, 2003, pg 26-38 ISBN 081573283X</ref><ref>[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=412&letter=G&search=Granada Granada] by Richard Gottheil, Meyer Kayserling, ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''. 1906 ed.</ref> A notable exception was [[Poland]], which served as a haven for European Jewry because of its relative tolerance - by the mid-sixteenth century, 80 percent of the world’s Jews lived in Poland. <ref>[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Poland.html Jewish Virtual Library - Poland]</ref><br/>-<br/>-An early champion of toleration in Europe was [[Pawel Wlodkowic]], who at the [[Council of Constance]] advocated the [[pagan]] nations' rights.<ref>[http://original.britannica.com/eb/article-28175/Poland#396759.hook Britannica Online - Poland: The rule of Jagielo ]</ref> However, the development of a body of theory on the subject of toleration didn't begin until the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, in response to the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the [[Wars of Religion]] and persecutions that followed the breaks with the [[Catholic Church]] instigated by [[Martin Luther]] and [[Huldrych Zwingli]] and others.  In response to the theory of persecution that was used to justify wars of religion and the execution of persons convicted of [[heresy]] and [[witchcraft]], writers such as [[Sebastian Castellio]] and [[Michel de Montaigne]] questioned the morality of religious persecution, and offered arguments for toleration. By contrast, Poland, which had been uniquely tolerant and ethnically as well as religiously diverse, officially confirmed its status as "a place of shelter for heretics" in the [[Warsaw Confederation | Confederation of Warsaw of 1573]],<ref>[http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=7748&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html Portal UNESCO, Poland - The General Confederation of Warsaw]</ref> the first toleration act in Europe.<ref>[http://www.polityka.pl/archive/do/registry/secure/showArticle?id=945 Dzieje podzielone, Prof. Janusz Tazbir, Polityka 03-07-2004]</ref><br/>-<br/>-A detailed and influential body of writing on the question of toleration was produced in [[Great Britain|Britain]] in the seventeenth century, during and after the destructive [[English Civil Wars]]. [[John Milton]] and radical Parliamentarians such as [[Gerrard Winstanley]] argued that Christian and Jewish worship should be protected, and it was during the period that [[Oliver Cromwell]] allowed the return of Jews to England.  These early theories of toleration were limited however, and did not extend toleration to [[Roman Catholics]] (who were perceived as disloyal to their country) or [[atheists]] (who were held to lack any moral basis for action).  [[John Locke]], in his [[A Letter Concerning Toleration|Letter Concerning Toleration]] and [[Two Treatises of Government]] proposed a more detailed and systematic theory of toleration, which included a principle of [[Separation of Church and State]] that formed the basis for future constitutional democracies.  The British [[Toleration Act of 1689]] was the political result of seventeenth century theorists and political exigency, which despite the limited scope of the toleration it granted was nevertheless a key development in the history of toleration, which helped produce greater political stability in the British Isles.<br/>-  <br/>-The philosophers and writers of the [[The Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], especially [[Voltaire]] and [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]], promoted and further developed the notion of religious tolerance, which however was not sufficient to prevent the atrocities of the [[Reign of Terror]].  The incorporation by [[Thomas Jefferson]] and others of Locke's theories of toleration into the [[Constitution of the United States of America]] was arguably more successful.<br/>-<br/>-== Recent development ==<br/>-Though developed to refer to the [[religious toleration]] of minority religious sects following the [[Protestant Reformation]], the terms "toleration" and "tolerance" are increasingly used to refer to a wider range of tolerated practices and groups, such as the toleration of sexual practices and orientations, or of political parties or ideas widely considered objectionable.  Changing applications and understandings of the term can sometimes make debate on the question difficult.<br/>-<br/>-For example, a distinction is sometimes drawn between mere "Toleration" and a higher notion of "Religious Liberty":  <br/>-<br/>-<blockquote>Some philosophers [. . .] regard toleration and religious freedom as quite distinct things and emphasize the differences between the two.  They understand toleration to signify no more than forbearance and the permission given by the adherents of a dominant religion for other religions to exist, even though the latter are looked upon with disapproval as inferior, mistaken, or harmful.  In contrast these thinkers recognize religious liberty as as the recognition of equal freedom for all religions and denominations without any kind of discrimination among them [. . .] in the case of religious liberty, no one is rightfully possessed of the power not to tolerate or to cancel this liberty.<ref name=Zagorin5>Zagorin, Perez (2003) ''How the Idea of Religious Toleration Came to the West'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press).</ref></blockquote><br/>-<br/>-Discussions of toleration therefore often divided between those who view the term as a minimal and perhaps even historical virtue (perhaps today to be replaced by a more positive and robust appreciation of [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]] or [[Multiculturalism|diversity]]), and those who view it as a concept with an important continuing vitality, and who are more likely to use the term in considering contemporary issues regarding discrimination on the basis of race, nationality, gender, sexuality, disability, and other reasons.<br/>-<br/>-There are also debates with regard to the historical factors that produced the principle of toleration, as well as to the proper reasons toleration should be exercised, with some arguing that the growth of [[skepticism]] was an important or necessary factor in the development of toleration, and others arguing that religious belief or an evolving notion of respect for individual persons was or is the basis on which toleration was or should be practiced.<br/>-<br/>-== Tolerance and monotheism ==<br/>-One theory of the origins of religious intolerance, propounded by [[Sigmund Freud]] in ''Moses and Monotheism,'' links intolerance to monotheism.  More recently, [[Bernard Lewis]] and Mark Cohen have argued that the modern understanding of tolerance, involving concepts of national identity and equal citizenship for persons of different religions, was not considered a value by pre-modern Muslims or Christians, due to the implications of monotheism.<ref>Lewis (1997), p.321; (1984) p.65; Cohen (1995), p.xix</ref> The historian [[Geoffrey Rudolph Elton|G.R. Elton]] explains that in pre-modern times, monotheists viewed such toleration as a sign of weakness or even wickedness towards God. <ref>  quoted in Cohen (1995), p.xix</ref> The usual definition of tolerance in pre-modern times as Bernard Lewis puts it was that: <br/>-<br/>-{{cquote|I am in charge. I will allow you some though not all of the rights and privileges that I enjoy, provided that you behave yourself according to rules that I will lay down and enforce."<ref name=LewisBrandeis1>Lewis (2006), pp.25-36</ref>}}<br/>-<br/>-[[Mark Cohen]] states that it seems that all the monotheistic religions in power throughout the history have felt it proper, if not obligatory, to persecute nonconforming religions. <ref name="Cohen1"> Cohen (1995) p. xix </ref> Therefore, Cohen concludes, [[Islamic Golden Age|Medieval Islam]] and [[Middle Ages|Medieval Christianity]] in power should have persecuted non-believers in their lands and "Judaism, briefly in power during the Hasmonean period (second century BCE) should have persecuted pagan Idumeans". <ref name="Cohen1"/> Cohen continues: "When all is said and done, however, the historical evidence indicates that the [[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain|Jews of Islam]], especially during the formative and classical centuries (up to thirteenth century), experienced much less persecution than did the Jews of [[Christendom]]. This begs a more thorough and nuanced explanation than has hitherto been given."<ref name="Cohen1"/><br/>-<br/>-==Tolerating the intolerant==<br/>-Philosopher [[Karl Popper]]'s assertion in ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'' that we are warranted in refusing to tolerate intolerance illustrates that there are limits to tolerance.<br/>-<br/>-In particular, should a tolerant society tolerate intolerance? What if by tolerating action "A", society destroys itself? Tolerance of "A" could be used to introduce a new thought system leading to intolerance of vital institution "B". It is difficult to strike a balance and different societies do not always agree on the details, indeed different groups within a single society also often fail to agree. The current suppression of [[Nazism]] in [[Germany]] is considered intolerant by some countries, for instance, while in Germany itself it is Nazism which is considered intolerably intolerant.<br/>-<br/>-Philosopher [[John Rawls]] devotes a section of his influential and controversial book ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' to the problem of whether a just society should or should not tolerate the intolerant, and to the related problem of whether or not, in any society, the intolerant have any right to complain when they are not tolerated.<br/>-<br/>-Rawls concludes that a just society must be tolerant; therefore, the intolerant must be tolerated, for otherwise, the society would then be intolerant, and so unjust. However, Rawls qualifies this by insisting that society and its social institutions have a reasonable right of self-preservation that supersedes the principle of tolerance. Hence, the intolerant must be tolerated but ''only insofar as they do not endanger the tolerant society and its institutions''.<br/>-<br/>-Similarly, continues Rawls, while the intolerant might forfeit the right to complain when they are themselves not tolerated, other members of society have a right, perhaps even a duty, to complain on their behalf, again, as long as society itself is not endangered by these intolerant members. The [[ACLU]] is a good example of a social institution that protects the rights of the intolerant, as it frequently defends the right to free speech of such intolerant organizations as the [[Ku Klux Klan]].<br/>-<br/>-== References ==<br/>-<br/>+{{Expand|date=January 2007}}<br/>+{{Mergewith|Toleration|date=July 2008}}<br/>+{{For|the Religioustolerance.org website|Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance}}<br/>+[[Image:CrossMenorahOxford 20051225KaihsuTai.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Christian cross|cross]] of the [[war memorial]] and a [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]] for [[Hanukkah]] coexist in [[Oxford]].]]<br/>+<br/>+'''Religious toleration''' is the condition of accepting or permitting others' [[religion|religious]] beliefs and practices which disagree with one's own.<br/>+<br/>+In a country with a [[state religion]], ''toleration'' means that the government permits religious practices of other sects besides the state religion, and does not persecute believers in other faiths. It is a partial status, and might still be accompanied by forms of [[religious discrimination]]. Religious toleration as a Government policy merely means the absence of [[religious persecution]]; unlike [[religious liberty]] it does not mean that religions are equal before the law. Toleration is a [[privilege]] granted by Government (which it may do by law or charter), not a [[right]] against it; governments have often tolerated some religions and not others.   <br/>+<br/>+Religious toleration "as a government-sanctioned practice — the sense on which most discussion of the phenomenon relies —<br/>+is not attested before the sixteenth century", which makes it rather difficult to apply the concept to topics like [[Persecution of religion in ancient Rome]].<ref>H.A.Drake, ''Lambs into Lions: explaining early Christian intolerance'', Past and Present 153 (1996), p.8, [http://past.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/153/1/3 Oxford Journals] </ref> <br/>+<br/>+Historically, toleration has been a contentious issue within many religions as well as between one religion and another. At issue is not merely whether other faiths should be permitted, but also whether a ruler who is a believer may be tolerant, or permit his subordinates to be. In the [[Middle Ages]], toleration of [[Judaism]] was a contentious issue throughout [[Christendom]]. Today, there are concerns about toleration of [[Christianity]] in [[Sharia|Islamic states]] (see also [[dhimmi]]).<br/>+<br/>+[[Proselytism]] can be a contentious issue; it can be regarded as an offence against the validity of others' religions, or as an expression of one's own faith.<br/>+<br/>+==The element of objection== <br/>+<br/>+For individuals, religious toleration generally means an attitude of acceptance towards other people's religions. It does not mean that one views other religions as equally true; merely that others have the right to hold and practice their beliefs. This element of objection is important. People, who take these matters seriously, often experience distress when they are confronted with religious beliefs that they regard as idolatrous, [[Superstition|superstitious]], [[Heresy|heretical]] or [[Schism (religion)|schismatic]]. <br/>+<br/>+==Contexts of religious tolerance== <br/>+<br/>+At least five contexts of religious tolerance can be distinguished. Religious tolerance as a state sanctioned practice can more precisely termed ''civil tolerance''. Civil tolerance is concerned with "the policy of the state towards religious dissent".<ref>Coffey 2000: 11</ref> In contrast to this, ecclesiastical tolerance is concerned with the degree of diversity tolerated within a particular church.<ref>Coffey 2000: 12</ref> Without this distinction, the [[Christian debate on persecution and toleration]] in England could not be adequately understood.   <br/>+<br/>+Furthermore, there is also a ''social'' and a ''polemical'' context of religious tolerance. The grand theme of ''divine tolerance'' is the emphasis on "the patience and longsuffering of God" as it is frequently portrayed in the Christian [[Bible]]; This image of God has been invoked by early Christian advocates of toleration.  <br/>+<br/>+===The polemical context===<br/>+<br/>+Contemporary authors such as [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Christopher Hitchens]] and [[Daniel C. Dennett]] have all challenged the tolerance of religion. In ''[[The End of Faith]]'', Sam Harris asserts that we should be unwilling to tolerate unjustified beliefs about morality, spirituality, politics, and the origin of humanity. In his [[preface]] to ''[[The God Delusion]]'', Richard Dawkins says, "If this book works as I intend, religious readers who open it will be atheists when they put it down."<ref name="preface">Dawkins, Richard.

At that time, heated discussions were continually held in political circles on the issue as to whether such a poor state as the Grand Duchy of [[Hessen]] could afford a technically oriented higher educational institution, or even a polytechnic. After the foundation of the '''TH Darmstadt''' in 1877, student numbers kept on being so low that in the years from 1881 to 1882 there were long debates in public about closing down the University. In this difficult situation, the local government and the University made the courageous decision to set up the first chair of [[electrical engineering]] worldwide. Thus the School of Electrical Engineering came into being as the sixth faculty of the TH Darmstadt, which was a novelty in academia, because until then no other polytechnic or university had had its own Faculty of Electrical Engineering.

This was facilitated by a [[land reform]] introduced by Japanese Governor-General [[Terauchi Masatake]] which subsequently proved extremely unpopular with large segments of the Korean population. The Korean land ownership system was a complex system of absentee landlords, partial owner-tenants, and cultivators with traditional but without legal proof of ownership. Terauchi's new Land Survey Bureau conducted cadastral surveys that reestablished ownership by basis of written proof ([[deed]]s, titles, and similar documents). Ownership was denied to those who could not provide such written documentation (mostly lower class and partial owners, who had only traditional verbal "cultivator rights"). Although the plan succeeded in reforming land ownership/taxation structures, it added tremendously to the bitter and hostile environment of the time by enabling a huge amount of Korean land to be seized by the government and sold at [[subsidy|subsidized]] costs to any Japanese family willing to [[Settler|settle]] in Korea as part of a larger effort at [[colonization]].<ref name="Japan Focus"> {{cite web|url=http://www.japanfocus.org/products/details/2220 |title=Legal Categories, Demographic Change and Japan’s Korean Residents in the Long Twentieth Century |accessdate=2007-02-19 |last=Nozaki |first=Yoshiko |coauthors=Hiromitsu Inokuchi, Tae-young Kim }}</ref>.<br/>+<br/>+Japanese landlords included both individuals and corporations, such as the [[Oriental Development Company]].
