In this animation, the red colour represents [[live steam]] entering the cylinder, blue represents expanded (spent) steam being exhausted from the cylinder. Note that the cylinder receives two steam injections during each full rotation; the same occurs in the cylinder on the other side of the engine.]]<!-- NOTE: The animated Gif cannot be re-sized, it will break the animation -->{{clr}}<br/> <br/> Exhaust steam is directed upwards to the atmosphere through the chimney, by way of a nozzle called a [[blastpipe]] that gives rise to the familiar "chuffing" sound of the steam locomotive. The blastpipe is placed at a strategic point inside the smokebox that is at the same time traversed by the combustion gases drawn through the boiler and grate by the action of the steam blast. The combining of the two streams, steam and exhaust gases, is crucial to the efficiency of any steam locomotive, and the internal profiles of the chimney (or, more strictly speaking, the ''ejector'') require careful design and adjustment. This has been the object of intensive studies by a number of engineers (and almost totally ignored by others with sometimes catastrophic effect). The fact that the draught depends on the exhaust pressure means that power delivery and power generation are automatically self-adjusting. Among other things, a balance has to be struck between obtaining sufficient draught for combustion whilst giving the exhaust gases and particles sufficient time to be consumed. In the past, fierce draught could lift the fire off the grate, or cause the ejection of unburnt particles of fuel, dirt and pollution for which steam locomotives had an unenviable reputation. Moreover, the pumping action of the exhaust has the counter effect of exerting ''back pressure'' on the side of the piston receiving steam, thus slightly reducing cylinder power. Designing the exhaust ejector has become a specific science in which [[André Chapelon|Chapelon]], [[Adolph Giesl-Gieslingen|Giesl]] and [[Livio Dante Porta|Porta]] were successive masters, and it was largely responsible for spectacular improvements in thermal efficiency and a significant reduction in maintenance time<ref name="A1" >See section of the [[LNER Class A1/A3]] article on the sharp increase in availability brought about in this respect by the application of the [[Kylchap]] exhaust to Gresley Pacifics in the early 1960s</ref> and pollution.<ref>J.J.G.

On 9 July 1921, a truce was declared. On 11 October negotiations were opened under British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] and Arthur Griffith, who headed the Irish Republic's delegation.  The Irish Treaty delegation set up Headquarters in [[Hans Place]], Knightsbridge and on 5 December 1921 at 11:15 am it was decided by the delegation during private discussions at 22 Hans Place to recommend the Treaty to the Dáil Éireann; negotiations continued until 2:30 am on 6 December 1921 after which the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty|Treaty]] was signed by the parties.<br/> <br/>-<br/>+[[File:Michael Collins "Free State Demonstration" March 13, 1922.jpg|thumb|[[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] addressing a crowd in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] at a "Free State Demonstration" on 13 March 1922.]]<br/> That these negotiations would produce a form of Irish government short of the independence wished for by republicans was not in doubt. The United Kingdom could not offer a republican form of government without losing prestige and risking demands for something similar throughout the Empire. Furthermore, as one of the negotiators, [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], later admitted (and he was in a position to know, given his role in the independence war), the IRA at the time of the truce was weeks, if not days, from collapse, with a chronic shortage of ammunition. "Frankly, we thought they were mad", Collins said of the sudden British offer of a truce, although it was likely they would have continued in one form or another, given the level of public support. The [[President of the Irish Republic|President of the Republic]], Éamon de Valera, realising that a republic was not on offer, decided not to be a part of the treaty delegation and so be tainted by more militant republicans as a "sellout". Yet his own proposals published in January 1922 fell far short of an autonomous all-Ireland republic.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}<br/> <br/> As expected, the Anglo-Irish Treaty explicitly ruled out a republic. What it offered was [[dominion]] status, as a state of the British Commonwealth, equal to Canada, Newfoundland, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. Though less than expected by the Sinn Féin leadership, it was substantially more than the initial form of home rule within the United Kingdom sought by [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] from 1880, and a serious advancement on the Home Rule Act of 1914 that the Irish nationalist leader [[John Redmond]] had achieved through parliamentary proceedings. However, it all but confirmed the [[partition of Ireland]] between [[Northern Ireland]] and the Irish Free State. It was ratified by the [[Second Dáil]], splitting Sinn Féin in the process.</td>

As such at 09:30 the order to withdraw was rescinded and B Company were tasked to re-occupy the position.

Also the songs "Roadrunner," "It Ain't What You Do," "I Will Stay" and "The Phone Rang" were classics. ''Roadrunner'' was recorded in Stockholm at Marcus Music Studios, and the album was also pressed in Stockholm. ''Roadrunner'' can be considered as one of the major Finnish rock albums, and it was Finland's best-selling album by a Finnish band in from 1974 until 1985, when the [[Dingo (band)|Dingos]]' ''Kerjäläisten valtakunta'' exceeded the volume of sales. Also the album cover art (by Risto Vuorimies) has become a classic: it was the only Finnish album cover in 1977's Hipgnosisin and Roger Dean's work Album Cover Album (Dragons, World Book). The ''Roadrunner'' cover was designed by Kari Korhonen, who also made a [[Donald Duck]] ("Rokkikukot") comic book version of the album cover. ''Roadrunner'' is still considered one of Finnish rock music's most important albums, and it is Finland's seventh-best-selling album of all time. The cover's stylish motif was chosen by Hurriganes' bassist Cisse Häkkinen, who owned a light blue 1954 Cadillac Series 62 sedan. The cover shows the Hurriganes' Remu Aaltonen, Cisse Häkkinen and Albert Järvinen posing elegantly in suits sitting on the back seat of the Cadillac. The car ended up in the ownership of Kari Niiranen, or "DJ Nite," a highly popular disc jockey who also toured with Hurriganes. ''Roadrunner'' is regarded as one of the best Finnish rock records ever released, and in 2007, it was re-released as a SACD mixed to a 5.1 format.<br/> <br/> ==Crazy Days: Kallio returns (1975)==</td>

A lone male gives an ecstatic display, where it stands still and places its head on its chest before inhaling and giving a courtship call for 1–2&nbsp;seconds; it then moves around the colony and repeats the call. A male and female then stand face to face, with one extending its head and neck up and the other mirroring it; they both hold this posture for several minutes. Once in pairs, couples waddle around the colony together, with the female usually following the male.
