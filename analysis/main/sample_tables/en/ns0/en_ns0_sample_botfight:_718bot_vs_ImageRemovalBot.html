In the course of his residence in [[Italy]] Baudry derived strong inspiration from Italian art with the mannerism of [[Correggio]], as was very evident in the two works he exhibited in the [[Paris Salon|Salon]] of [[1857]], which were purchased for the Luxembourg: ''The Martyrdom of a Vestal Virgin and The Child''. His ''Leda'', ''St John the Baptist'', and a ''Portrait of Beul'', exhibited at the same time, took a first prize that year. Throughout this early period Baudry commonly selected mythological or fanciful subjects, one of the most noteworthy being ''The Pearl and the Wave'' (1862). Once only did he attempt an historical picture, ''Charlotte Corday after the murder of Marat'' ([[1861]]); and returned by preference to the former class of subjects or to painting portraits of illustrious men of his day: [[Guizot]], [[Charles Garnier]], [[Edmond About]].</td>

This is not dissimilar to the 'snowcutter' trigger on the SA80A2.<br/> <br/> There is also a drill purpose version of the L98A1, designated L103A1. This weapon cannot chamber rounds as the firing pin is cut short and the barrel filled with cement.

While in the area, he served as a consular representative in San Jose and founded the Brush Electric Light company in San Jose. While in San Jose, de Saisset married Maria Palomares and together had four children: Henrietta, Ernest, Pierre, and Isabel. Of these, Henrietta was the only to marry, and none of the siblings had any children of their own. <br/> <br/> Ernest was the oldest of the children and began his education at [[Santa Clara College]] when he was sixteen. He continued as a student for three years, showing potential in French and drawing. During the final year of his studies, Ernest studied painting with Fr. Tortone, who highly approved of his work. Since art instructors were in short supply in pioneer California, the de Saisset family sent Ernest to [[Paris]] for further study in art. In 1895, he returned to California; however, he died four years later.</td>

As far back as 1867 Parkes at an intercolonial conference had said: ''"I think the time has arrived when these colonies should be united by some federal bond of connexion."''  Shortly afterwards a bill to establish the proposed federal council was introduced by him and passed through both the New South Wales houses.  This was afterwards shelved by the action of the Secretary of State for the Colonies. Various other conferences were held in the next 20 years at which the question came up, in which Parkes took a leading part, but in October 1884 he was blowing cold and suggesting that it would be "better to let the idea of federation mature in men's minds", and New South Wales then stood out of the proposed federal council scheme. <br/> <br/>-<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Mp005988.jpg|left|thumb|A wood engraving of Sir Henry Parkes moving the first resolution at the federation conference in Melbourne, March 1 1890]] -->In October 1889 a report on the defences of Australia suggested among other things the federation of the forces of all the Australian colonies and a uniform gauge for railways.
