RPG Final Fantasy VII, the Turks (タークス, Tākusu?) is the unofficial nickname of the Investigation Division of the General Affairs Department of the Shin-Ra Electric Power Company (神羅電気動力株式会社総務部調査課, Shinra Denki Dōryoku Kabushiki-gaisha Sōmubu Chōsaka?), mistranslated as the Department of Administrative Research in the English localization. They perform covert operations on behalf of the company, including espionage, kidnappings and assassinations. They also scout for potential candidates for Shin-Ra's elite military unit, SOLDIER, and serve as bodyguards for the Shin-Ra executives. Within the game, they serve as recurring antagonists throughout, although they are not above forming temporary alliances with AVALANCHE, the game's group of central protagonists. Final Fantasy VII's prequel, Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII, focuses exclusively on the Turks in the years leading up to the events of Final Fantasy VII.<br/> <br/>-BY JOSH. ==<br/>+They also appear in Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, set two years after the original. Here, they serve as allies of AVALANCHE, as well as bodyguards to Rufus Shinra and aids in his self-appointed mission to restore the world's vitality.<br/>+<br/>+Contents [hide]<br/>+1 Main members <br/>+1.1 Tseng <br/>+1.2 Elena <br/>+1.3 Reno <br/>+1.4 Rude <br/>+2 Former Turks <br/>+3 Trivia <br/>+4 References <br/>+5 See also <br/>+6 External links <br/>+ <br/>+<br/>+<br/>+[edit] Main members<br/>+Spoiler warning: Plot and/or ending details follow.<br/>+The Turks are comprised of the following individuals:<br/>+<br/>+<br/>+[edit] Tseng<br/>+ <br/>+Tseng in Advent ChildrenTseng (ツォン, Tson?) is the stern but polite and calm leader of the Turks. He has long, black hair and what appears to be a tilak in the middle of his forehead. Though he is young, he has been an active member of the Turks for more than 10 years [1], and has known Aerith Gainsborough — for whom he seems to have romantic feelings[2][3] — since she was a child. Despite his long-standing admiration for Aerith, there are hints that his affections later shift to Elena.<br/>+<br/>+Tseng is the only Turk not fought at any point during Final Fantasy VII. He is wounded by Sephiroth during an investigation of the Temple of the Ancients (though, due to his absence from the later stages of the game & a translation error, many thought him dead). However, he re-appears in Advent Children, wherein he and Elena retrieve Jenova's remains from the Northern Crater before being attacked, and subsequently captured, by Kadaj's gang. After enduring torture at the villains' hands, he is rescued — along with Elena — by Vincent Valentine, and the two of them later show up in Edge to rescue Rufus. Tseng is voiced by Junichi Suwabe in the Japanese version of the film and Ryun Yu in the English version.<br/>+<br/>+<br/>+[edit] Elena<br/>+ <br/>+Elena in Advent ChildrenElena (イリーナ, Irīna?) is a junior member of the Turks, and the only female member seen in the original Final Fantasy VII. She is a young woman with short, blonde hair and brown eyes. In Before Crisis, she was a high school student whose father was a teacher in the Shin-Ra Military Academy and whose older sister was a member of the Turks. Though she resented — and wanted no contact with — her sister and the other Turks for outperforming her in their status, an encounter with them convinced her to join the group. Elena then obtained her position as the newest recruit after Reno sustained injuries battling AVALANCHE in Midgar during Final Fantasy VII.<br/>+<br/>+Elena is naive, impetuous and somewhat overeager, with a loose tongue that sometimes causes her to inadvertently reveal secret information. She takes her job much more seriously than Reno and Rude do, and also becomes quite frustrated with their casual attitudes.[4] She also has a crush on Tseng and temporarily holds Cloud's party accountable for the injuries he suffered while investigating the Temple of the Ancients. Elena appears briefly in Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, wherein she is voiced by Megumi Toyoguchi in the Japanese version and Bettina Bush in the English version. Her role is much less prominent than that of her partners, Reno and Rude, spending most of the movie off-camera recovering along with Tseng after being tortured by Kadaj, Yazoo, and Loz.<br/>+<br/>+<br/>+[edit] Reno<br/>+ <br/>+Rude(Left) and Reno(Right) as they appear in Advent ChildrenReno (レノ, Reno?) is a prominent member of the Turks with a lanky physique, unkempt red hair terminating in a long ponytail and two symmetrical red marks on his cheek bones (apparently tattoos, though popularly believed to be scars). He is always seen wearing goggles on his forehead, an unzipped suit jacket and an untucked dress shirt. He is cocky, cynical, and somewhat lazy, but is highly skilled and takes great pride in his work. In Advent Children, however, he is portrayed as being somewhat less cynical, clumsy and more playful. His fighting skills are obviously far above the level of a normal human, but he is defeated with relative ease by Loz and Yazoo (neither of whom are human, to be fair), in fact he only appears to actually hit them once. In battle, he wields a retractable metallic rod which can deal electric shocks. Reno also has a penchant for gossiping and is a competent helicopter pilot.<br/>+<br/>+Reno is first encountered in Final Fantasy VII when he enters a derelict church in the slums of Midgar's Sector 5 in an attempt to capture Aerith (where he instructs his subordinates to be careful not to step on the flowers after stepping on them himself). Not long after, he activates the bombs that blow up the Sector 7 support pillar before having a brief battle with Cloud Strife, Tifa Lockhart and Barret Wallace. This fight leaves him temporarily incapacitated, during which time Elena is promoted to Turks status. He later reappears outside of Gongaga with his long-time partner, Rude, having been assigned to intercept AVALANCHE. Despite the rivalry between the two groups, he is not beyond teaming up with Cloud and his companions in Wutai, where both parties had to work together after each had a member kidnapped by Don Corneo - Also in this time, upon encountering Cloud in a bar, and then after dealing with Corneo & receiving new orders to search for Cloud, Reno decides not to fight Cloud as they (Reno, Rude, & Elena) are off-duty.<br/>+<br/>+Reno has a prominent role in Advent Children. Consistent with his attitude at the end of the original Final Fantasy VII, Reno possesses no true hostility towards his former enemies[1]. As of Advent Children, the Turks are on the same side as AVALANCHE and join the fight against the film's villains. Reno and Rude primarily serve as the film's comic relief. His comical role in Advent Children includes being locked out while Cloud and Rufus have an important talk, bringing out his weapon and accidentally whacking Rude in the head, being knocked back several hundred feet by Yazoo and landing on Rude, climbing a building to save Rufus and using Rude's head as support, stepping on and crushing Rude's trademark sunglasses, having a child stick two of his fingers up his nose while trying to rescue him from Bahamut along with Rude, insulting Jenova and then apologising to Loz and Yazoo before he realises what he is saying, and observing that since the bomb in the highway scene was "Shin-Ra technology at its finest", Rude must have made it.<br/>+<br/>+An interesting aspect of Reno's personality is his unique speech pattern. In the original Japanese version of Final Fantasy VII Reno frequently ended his sentences with the phrase "zo, to" or the slightly more formal "yo, to". The closest English equivalent to this pattern is adding "yo" to the end of a sentence. In the Japanese version of Advent Children, fans were able to realize Tifa was talking to Reno in the beginning, because she mimicked his speech pattern when speaking with him ("Oboeteru, zo to").<br/>+<br/>+He is voiced by Keiji Fujiwara in the Japanese version, and Quinton Flynn in the English version.<br/>+<br/>+<br/>+[edit] Rude<br/>+ <br/>+All four Turks as they appear in Advent ChildrenRude (ルード, Rūdo?) is a tall, naturally bald[5] man with a slight goatee. He always wears sunglasses and carries spare pairs with him. Rude is rarely seen without his long-time partner, Reno, and is rather taciturn, tending to relegate the talking to Reno. He also becomes uncomfortable when brought into a conversation, as seen during the meeting with Cloud and later when meeting Yazoo and Loz in the Advent Children movie. Rude is a superb physical combatant and prefers to use his fists in battle. In one of his rare lines of dialogue in Final Fantasy VII, he reveals to Reno that he has a crush on Tifa Lockhart, a skilled martial artist like himself, though nothing ever develops between the two. He has quite a prominent role in Advent Children always seen with his partner Reno. They are mainly used for comical effect, with Reno normally injuring Rude or when fighting Loz a sign drops on him after Reno is kicked into it. During his confrontation with Loz he does seem to put up a better fight than Reno against Yazoo, landing quite a few punches. In the end he and Reno use a massive explosion to take out Loz and Yazoo who somehow survive it and turn up again just after Cloud defeats Kadaj. Years ago, when there was war between AVALANCHE and Shinra, Rude fell in love with a woman named Chelsea. Unfortunately, she was an AVALANCHE spy, who as well fell in love with Rude, but left him because they were on different sides. Rude didn't take it so well, especially since he couldn't even say goodbye to her, since then, he's been rather quiet and refuses to get close to anyone emotionally. He is voiced by Taiten Kusunoki in the Japanese version of Advent Children and Crispin Freeman in the English version.<br/>+<br/>+<br/>+[edit] Former Turks<br/>+Verdot (ヴェルド, Verudo?)[6] (roughly, Vehr-doh) is the previous leader of the Turks. He is very particular on matters relating to succeeding in missions and very unforgiving when it comes to failure. Tseng considers him a role model and eventually succeeds him. Though many of his subordinates are intimidated by his severity, they all deeply respect him. When Heidegger usurps his position at one point during the story, Verdot blackmails President Shinra into returning it. Formerly a resident of the town of Kalm, he had a daughter and wife that he believed perished when the town was razed due to his own misinterpreted commands. In actuality, his daughter survived, and is eventually revealed to be the leader of AVALANCHE, Elfé. He cares very deeply for the Turks, and does not wish for them to suffer any events similar to what he has; he also cares very much for his daughter, defecting from Shin-ra when he discovers she is alive. Verdot appeared only in Before Crisis, but is mentioned in Last Order: Final Fantasy VII. <br/>+Vincent Valentine (ヴィンセント・ヴァレンタイン, Vinsento Varentain?) served as a gunman in the Turks until approximately 30 years prior to the events of Final Fantasy VII. While on a mission in Nibelheim during the later stages of the Jenova Project, Vincent was shot by Professor Hojo, who then used his body for experimental purposes, turning him into the man seen in Final Fantasy VII and its subsequent sequels. The experiments altered his body in many ways, including fixing his physical age. Though he's chronologically 60 years old (In Dirge of Cerberus), he still bears the appearance he held at 27. <br/>+The main characters of Before Crisis are all Turks. The player chooses from eight unnamed characters (four young men and four young women), each with his or her own backstory, personality, strengths and weaknesses. Six of these Turks also appear in Last Order, where they act as support for Tseng, Reno, and Rude, but none are given proper names and few have dialogue. After barely surviving the pre-Final Fantasy VII events of Before Crisis, they make an appearance along with Verdot in Midgar during the coming of the Meteor disaster and assist the other Turks in evacuating civilians. Their whereabouts during the majority of Final Fantasy VII's events are currently unknown. <br/>+<br/>+[edit] Trivia<br/>+A misconception has arisen concerning Tseng — due to an early fan translation of Advent Children — that his name is pronounced "Shion" (shee-ohn) in Japanese. Rather than translating by ear, the Japanese subtitles included on the DVD were used, and "Tson" (ツォン) — the official katakana form of "Tseng" — was mis-read as the similar-looking "Shion" (シオン). As a result, many viewers were confused upon reading "Shion" while seeing Tseng in the film, and attempts to explain the error resulted in the aforementioned misconception. Tseng's name is written "Tson" in katakana due to the fact that his name is Chinese in origin. In Pinyin (a standard system that uses the Roman alphabet to phonetically represent the Chinese language), "e" represents a sound resembling the short "o" of the English language, also approximated in Japanese with an unlengthened "o" vowel. In Chinese Pinyin, his name is written as "Zeng" (曾), which is how it appears in Last Order. Also, in some translations, Elena refers to Tseng as 'senpai' which is a formal way to address elders in Japanese. There is also some minor confusion in some translations where Reno refers to Rufus as 'senpai', given that he is the acting president of Shin-Ra. <br/>+Many fans mistakenly believed Tseng to have died after his encounter with Sephiroth in the Temple of the Ancients due to a translation error[citation needed] in the original English version of Final Fantasy VII. As a result, many were confused by his seemingly sudden appearance in Advent Children, although this can be attributed to the idea for the movie not having been conceived yet. This translation error was corrected in the PC version of Final Fantasy VII. <br/>+Reno possesses a distinct speech pattern in Japanese, speaking in a drawling, slangful manner and — most notably — ending most of his sentences with "zo, to" (ぞ、と), or simply "to" (と). Speech patterns such as Reno's are impossible to translate directly into English and can only be approximated by attempting to capture the same colloquial value as the original (performed through "yo" in several translations of Advent Children), which the English translations of the original game and Advent Children did not attempt to do. The trademark ending of "zo, to" has also been seen as a way to get across the message of, "I was really laid back when I said that." As "yo"s and slang are often used by people who crave to appear cool or 'laid back', the translation seen above is as accurate as it gets. <br/>+Near the end of Disc Two of Final Fantasy VII, the player has the option to fight Elena, Reno, and Rude, or refuse the battle. In either case the Turks survive, so there is no clear canonical outcome to this situation. If the player chooses to fight the Turks, several powerful armours can be stolen from them, including Elena's unique Minerva Band. <br/>+It is believed by some fans that the concept as well as some of the members of Organization XIII in Square Enix's Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories and Kingdom Hearts II are roughly based on a few members of the Turks, such as Organization XIII's Axel resembling Reno in many ways (due to the red-spiked hair, however this is prominent in Tetsuya Nomura's design). Axel and Reno are also voiced by the same actor in both Japanese and English version of Kingdom Hearts II and Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, Keiji Fujiwara and Quinton Flynn, respectively. They also seem to be the basis for the group in Final Fantasy Agito XIII. <br/>+Although portrayed as a bit cold and ruthless in the North American translation of Final Fantasy VII, Reno was in actuality made to be a comical character. <br/>+<br/>+[edit] References<br/>+^ (2005) Studio BentStuff Final Fantasy VII Ultimania Ω (in Japanese).

At least one soldier of the 2/1st Notts is known to have fought in this war with another battery.<ref>Public Record Office, war record of Gunner William Kind.</ref><br/> <br/>@@ -284,7 +284,12 @@\n<br/> }}<br/> <br/> ==External links==<br/>-*{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816151748/http://www.regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-england/varty/nt-rha.htm |date=August 16, 2007 |title=Nottinghamshire Royal Horse Artillery at regiments.org by T.F.Mills }}<br/>+*{{Wayback<br/>+ | url=http://www.regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-england/varty/nt-rha.htm<br/>+ | title=Nottinghamshire Royal Horse Artillery at regiments.org by T.F.Mills<br/>+ | date=20070816151748<br/>+ | df=yes <br/>+}}<br/> *[http://www.1914-1918.net/rha.htm ''The Royal Horse Artillery'' on The Long, Long Trail]<br/> *[http://www.wartimememoriesproject.com/greatwar/allied/royalhorseartillery-gw.php The Great War Royal Horse Artillery]<br/></td>

Throughout the band's career, this aspect was mainly provided by photographer and [[graphic artist]] [[Storm Thorgerson]] and his graphic studio [[Hipgnosis]] ([[Hip (slang)|hip]] [[gnosis]] or [[hypnosis]]). Many of these images have acquired fame in their own right, most notably the cover depicting a man shaking the hand of his burning alter-ego for ''Wish You Were Here'' and the [[refraction|refracting]] [[Prism (optics)|prism]] for ''Dark Side of the Moon''. The cover of "Meddle" underlined the band's ideas about the visualization of sound with its close-up of an ear underwater.<br/> <br/> Thorgerson was involved in the artwork for every album except the compilation album "Relics", which was illustrated by Mason, "The Piper at the Gates of Dawn", the front cover of which was a photograph by Vic Singh and the back cover a drawing by Barrett; "The Wall", for which the band employed [[Gerald Scarfe]]; and "The Final Cut", which was designed by Waters himself, using [[photography]] made by his then brother-in-law, Willie Christie. Only the covers for ''The Piper at the Gates of Dawn'', ''A Saucerful of Secrets'', and ''Ummagumma'' include images of the band members themselves, although concert photos and images of the band members sometimes appeared on inner gatefolds and inserts. David Gilmour explained this on a video/DVD on the making of ''Dark Side of the Moon'': "We always wanted to kind of... not be on our covers ourselves; not have pictures".<br/>-FLOYD

The word comes from the French word Noël meaning "Christmas" which derives from the [[Old French]] word noël, a variant of nael.  The [[Latin]] origin is the word ''natalis'' ("[[childbirth|birth]]").  According to the 18th century Irish linguist and historian Charles Vallencey, a more ancient common origin appears in the [[Hebrew]] word ''nolad'' (Hebrew letters ''nuwn waw lamed daled''), meaning "to bring forth young." Subsequently, the Irish named December ''Mi Nolagh'',{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} meaning "the month of the newborn."  The Irish word for Christmas day was simply ''Nolagh''.<ref>Vallencey, Charles. 1786. ''Collectanea de rebus hibernicis'', vol. iii. p.445.</ref> The word ''nolad'' is used Biblically to refer to birth.

On the other hand there may be logistic or hygienic reasons to use a bag only once. For example, a [[garbage bag]] is often disposed of with its content. A bag for packaging a disposable product is often disposed of when it is empty.<br/>+<br/>+An empty bag may or may not be very light and foldable to a small size. If it is, this is convenient for carrying it to the place where it is needed, such as a shop, and for storage of empty bags.<br/>+<br/>+Bags vary from small ones, like [[purse]]s (e.g. as an alternative to putting small objects in [[pocket]]s of [[clothing]]) to large ones for use in [[travel]]ing like a [[suitcase]]. <br/>+<br/>+Cheap [[disposable]] paper bags and [[plastic shopping bag]]s are very common in the retail trade as a convenience for [[shopping|shoppers]], and are often supplied by the shop for free or for a small [[fee]].

Efforts are being taken to control and reduce their use in some [[European Union]] countries, including [[Ireland]] and the [[Netherlands]]. In some cases the cheap bags are taxed so the customer must pay a fee where they may not have done previously. Sometimes heavy duty reusable plastic and fabric bags are sold, typically costing €0.5 to €1, and these may replace disposable bags entirely. Sometimes free replacements are offered when the bag wears out. A notable exception to this trend is the [[UK]], where disposable plastic bags are still freely available and are dominant.<br/>+<br/>+==References==<br/>+{{refs}}<br/>+* [[Joeseph Needham|Needham, Joseph]] (1986).

The relation of the legged triskele to other variants is unclear. Spiral forms of the triskele are often classed as [[solar symbol]]s, while the legged version, sometimes including a [[gorgon]] mask or [[Medusa (mythology)|Medusa]]'s head at the central axle point in the Sicilian version, suggests a [[chthonic]] significance.<br/>+<br/>+==Origins==<br/>+[[Image:Achilles Hector triskele cropped.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Attic [[Black-figure pottery|black-figure]] amphora showing [[Achilles]] dragging [[Hector]] from his [[chariot]], showing a triskele on the shield of the triumphant hero. (Boston 63.473, ca. [[510s BC|510 BC]])]]<br/>+The triskelion symbol appears in many early cultures, including on [[Mycenaean]] vessels, on coinage in [[Lycia]], and on staters of [[Pamphylia]] (at Aspendos, 370&ndash;333 BC) and [[Pisidia]]. A symbol of four conjoined legs, a '''tetraskelion''', is also known in Anatolia. [[Celt]]ic influences in [[Anatolia]], epitomized by the [[Gaul]]s who invaded and settled [[Galatia]], are especially noted by students who prefer to see a Celtic origin for the triskelion.<br/>+<br/>+==Sicilian triskelion==<br/>+[[Image:Flag of Sicily.svg|200px|thumb|left|The [[flag of Sicily]], featuring the revived ''trinacria'' symbol]]<br/>+Familiar as an ancient symbol of [[Sicily]], the triskelion is also featured on Greek coins of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], such as coins of [[Agathocles]] (317-289 B.C.). In Sicily, the first inhabitants mentioned in history are the tribes of the [[Sicani]] (Greek ''Sikanoi'') and the [[Siculi]] (Greek ''Sikeloi''), who have given Sicily its more familiar modern name. The triskelion was revived, as a suitably [[Neoclassicism|neoclassic]]&mdash;and non-Bourbon&mdash;emblem for the new Napoleonic Kingdom of the [[Two Sicilies]], by [[Joachim Murat]] in 1808 (''illustration, left'').<br/>+<br/>+[[Pliny the Elder]] attributes the origin of the triskelion of Sicily to the [[triangle (geometry)|triangular]] form of the island, ancient '''Trinacria''', which consists of three large capes equidistant from each other, pointing in their respective directions, the names of which were [[Messina|Pelorus]], [[Pachino|Pachynus]], and [[Marsala|Lilybæum]]. Thus Pliny provided an eminently rational explanation&mdash; but for a symbol that must be older than any [[cartography|cartographic conception]] of the island, surely. Since the triskelion may be associated with a multitude of triads, with new associations cropping up regularly, it is more productive just to look at the symbol itself.<br/>+<br/>+The three legs of the triskelion are reminiscent of Hephaestus' three-legged tables that ran by themselves. They were mentioned in ''[[Iliad]]'' xviii:    <br/>+<br/>+:"At the moment Hephaestus was busily<br/>+:Turning from bellows to bellows, sweating with toil<br/>+:As he laboured to finish a score of three-legged tables<br/>+:To stand around the sides of his firm-founded hall. On each<br/>+:Of the legs he had put a gold wheel, that those magic tables<br/>+:Might cause all to marvel by going with no other help<br/>+:To the gathering of gods and by likewise returning to his house."<br/>+<br/>+==Manx triskelion==<br/>+[[Image:ManxCarRegistrationPlate.jpg|thumb|left|Manx [[license plate|car registration plate]], with the triskelion]]<br/>+In the symbol for the more thoroughly Celtic [[Isle of Man]] in the [[Irish Sea]], the "three legs embowed" of the heraldic triskelion are represented now in armour, "spurred and garnished ''or'' (gold)." <br/>+<br/>+On Manx banknotes, the triskelion appears within a rim containing the Latin inscription ''<small>QUOCUNQUE JECERIS STABIT</small>''  ("Wherever you will throw it, it stands"), which is boldly confident enough, and safely divorced from any pagan connection.  Just how old the triskelion is as a symbol of Man is mooted; it is documented since the thirteenth or fourteenth century at least. The triskelion is alternatively known as the ''tre cassyn'' ("three legs") in [[Manx language|Manx]]. The symbol appears on the Isle of Man's ancient Sword of State, which may have belonged to [[Olaf Godredson]], who became King of the Sudreys (Southern [[Hebrides]] and the Isle of Man) in 1226.<br/>+<br/>+==Spiral triskele==<br/>+[[Image:Triple-Spiral-Symbol.png|right|thumb|150px|The [[triple spiral]] symbol]]<br/>+[[Image:Triskele-Symbol-spiral-five-thirds-turns.png|right|thumb|150px|Spiral triskelion, occasionally used as a Christian [[Trinitarian]] symbol]]<br/>+<br/>+The [[Celtic art|Celtic]] symbol of three conjoined [[triple spiral|spiral]]s may well have had triple significance similar to the imagery that lies behind the triskelion. That spiral motif is a [[Neolithic]] symbol in Western Europe: it is carved into the rock of a stone lozenge near the main entrance of the prehistoric [[Newgrange]] in County Meath, Ireland. Because of its [[Celt|Celtic]] associations, it is also used as a symbol of [[Brittany]] (alongside the ''[[Hermine#Heraldry|hermine]]'').<br/>+<br/>+In the north of Spain, the triskelion is used as a symbol of [[Galiza|Galizan]] and [[Asturias|Asturian]] nationalists. A similar symbol called ''[[lábaro]]'' by [[Cantabria]]n nationalists can be compared to the neighboring Basque culture's four-branched [[lauburu]].<br/>+<br/>+A possibly related symbol of [[Germanic paganism|Germanic]] origin is the [[Valknut]].<br/>+<br/>+==Third Reich==<br/>+The Third Reich adopted the Celtic triskelion as the insignia for a [[Waffen SS]] division composed of ("Celtic") Belgian volunteers. That has led to an association with the [[swastika]]. It is claimed, possibly apocryphally, that the similarity to the swastika caused confusion or distress amongst some [[Jew|Jewish]] refugees interned on the [[Isle of Man]] during [[World War II|World War 2]].<br/>+<br/>+==Modern use==<br/>+=== Neopagans and Reconstructionists ===<br/>+As a [[Celt|Celtic]] symbol, the triskelion, usually consisting of spirals, but also the "horned triskelion", sometimes plays a role in Celtic groups and, rarely, can be seen in use by [[Germanic neopaganism|Germanic neopagan]] groups.  The spiral triskelion is one of the primary symbols of [[Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism]], and also used by some [[Wicca]]ns.  Celtic Reconstructionists use the symbol to represent a variety of triplicities in their cosmology and theology;  it is also a favored symbol due to its association with the god [[Manannan mac Lir|Manannán Mac Lir]].  Wicca is syncretic in nature and often aesthetically adopts symbolism from various cultures, particularly Celtic symbolism. It is less commonly used amongst Germanic neopagan groups due to the non-Germanic origins of the symbol; use by Germanic groups may be due to confusion or association with Norse symbols with triple symmetries, like the [[Valknut]], the [[Triquetra]], or the symbol found on the [[Snoldelev Stone]].<br/>+<br/>+===BDSM===<br/>+A form of the triskelion has been proposed as a [[BDSM Emblem]] by some [[BDSM]] groups, partly based on a description in the ''[[Story of O]]''.  The specific emblem design is meant to be shown with metallic spokes and circle, and three holes (not dots) within the design.<br/>+<br/>+===Political usage of the triskelion===<br/>+A group of racist South African [[Whites]], the [[Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging|AWB]], have used a flag consisting of a red background with a white circle. In the circle, three black [[seven]]s form a design distantly reminiscent of the triskelion. In spite of the similarities to the [[swastika]] (and the overall resemblance to the Nazi flag, both having a black symbol on a white disc on a red background), they claim their flag is inspired by a Biblical meaning of the seven, and the fact that the organisation was founded on the seventh day of the seventh month, 1973 (from which the three 7's can be extracted).<br/>+<br/>+===Modern popular culture===<br/>+====Comics====<br/>+*The Triskelion is the name used for the headquarters of the [[Ultimates]] in the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Marvel Universe]].  The building has a three-pronged shape if viewed from above.<br/>+<br/>+* In the Manga [[Naruto]], the Curse Seal of the character Tayuya resembles a triskelion.<br/>+<br/>+[[Image:1988 Summer Olympics logo.png|thumb|right|120px|1988 Olympics logo, based on Sam-Taeguk]]<br/>+<br/>+====Film====<br/>+*[[Matthew Barney]] used the triskelion as a symbol to represent the fourth film in his work [[The Cremaster Cycle]].<br/>+<br/>+*A triskelion-esque swirl is part of the [[Westheimer Street Festival#Birth of the Montrose Patriot Art Vehicle|Montrose Patriot art vehicle]] - the swirl pattern on the driver side fender might have been a coincidence.<br/>+<br/>+*The [[James Bond]] film [[Die Another Day]] featured a Korean [[taeguk|Sam-Taeguk]] symbol (similar to the 1988 Olympic emblem) during the scene where Bond and Colonel Moon are in a duel on a hovercraft (the symbol is seen on a gong tower above a waterfall where Colonel Moon's hovercraft goes over).<br/>+<br/>+*The movie [[The Believer]], the protagonist has a tatoo of a triskelion on his arm.<br/>+<br/>+====Games====<br/>+*The collectible card game [[Magic: The Gathering]] has a card named ''Triskelion''.  This artifact creature has been depicted in two separate ways; both versions have three limbs, but neither  resembles the actual symbol.<br/>+<br/>+*The video game ''[[BloodRayne]]'' features triskelion as the symbol of Rayne's National Socialist enemies, instead of the historic use of the [[swastika]].<br/>+<br/>+*The video game ''[[Metroid Prime: Hunters]]'' features a character, [[Creatures in Metroid Prime 2, Metroid Prime Hunters, and Metroid Prime 3#Trace|Trace]], who can transform into a red, three-legged insectoid creature called triskelion.<br/>+<br/>+*The anthropomorphic role-playing game ''[[Ironclaw]]'' features a port city called Triskellion which resembles Sicily in atmosphere.  The flag of the city bears 3 clamshells in a radial pattern.<br/>+<br/>+[[Image:Flag of Ingushetia.svg|thumb|200px|left|The [[flag of Ingushetia]].  See also the [[:Image:Ryukyuflag.png|flag of the Ryukyu islands]].]]<br/>+<br/>+====Literature====<br/>+*Severian, the protagonist of ''The Book of the New Sun'' (written by [[Gene Wolfe]]) adopts a dog with three legs and names him "Triskele."<br/>+<br/>+* In ''Histoire d'O''' (English title: ''[[Story of O]]'' ), a [[sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] novel by [[France|French]] author [[Pauline Réage]], the [[Sexual slavery|slave women]] of Roissy all wear a ring bearing a spiral triskelion insignia, to remind them of their station.<br/>+<br/>+* In ''Limbo'', by Bernard Wolfe (1953) the triskelion represents an achievement of high level in a society that believes in amputation of one's limbs (legs, arms) to avoid war or fighting.<br/>+<br/>+====Music====<br/>+*Flea, the bassist for the band [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], has a tattoo of the triskel on his right pectoral muscle.<br/>+<br/>+====Television & Radio====<br/>+*In the second season ''[[Star Trek]]'' episode ''[[The Gamesters of Triskelion]]'', the crew of the Enterprise observe and are pressed into gladiatorial combat on a planet named Triskelion.  The symbol of the planet is a truncated blue triangle with a yellow stylized triskelion inscribed.<br/>+<br/>+*In the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' [[audio drama]] ''[[Storm Warning]]'', the Doctor meets an alien race called the '''Triskele''', who use a triskelion symbol to delineate the three aspects of their species.<br/>+<br/>+*A [[fractal]] version of the triskelion is a major motif of the 2005 TV series [[Threshold (TV series)|Threshold]].<br/>+<br/>+====Other uses====<br/>+*The Triskelion is shown on the seal of [[Tau Gamma Phi]], a [[Philippines|Filipino]] fraternity.  A member of Tau Gamma Phi is called a Triskelion. The triskelion is accompanied by the motto "it will stand no matter where you throw it" on the seal.<br/>+<br/>+*A triskelion pattern forms part of the [[:Image:US-DeptOfTransportation-Seal.png|seal]] of the [[United States Department of Transportation]]. The three spirals represent air, land, and sea transportation. The seal was adopted on February 1, 1967.<br/>+<br/>+*A triskelion shape is also found in the [[roundel]] of the [[Irish Air Corps]] (unique among air force roundels).
