It begins with Hemingway (Pete's dog) sleeping on Wentz. It leads into Hemingway's dream where Fall Out Boy is performing next to a [[Chevrolet Impala|1968 Chevrolet Impala]] while Hemingway is seeing fire hydrants, mailmen, dancing catwomen, and lead vocalist/guitarist [[Patrick Stump]] with a large cat head and dressed as a steak. <br/>+It then leads into a bunch of ex-Fall Out Boy fans all wearing black and white shirts saying how much they dislike Fall Out Boy walking over to Fall Out Boy throwing water balloons at them. They yell at them saying how they don't like them anymore ("forgetting them"). Hemingway (in a cape) howls and says, "Give the boys a break... everybody changes". The fans nod their head and the dog continues, "I mean, look at me. I used to be tiny". The fans nod their heads again and go back to watching Fall Out Boy play as confetti falls down. The breakdancing mailmen and catwomen are dancing along also. Wentz then tells Hemingway, "I didn't know you could talk". Hemingway replies, "Shut up Pete... this is my dream." After finishing the song, Wentz falls suddenly in the dream and Hemingway abruptly wakes up, jumping off Wentz. <br/>+<br/>+The video was filmed in one day when Fall Out Boy were in [[New York City]].

In November 2003, an article appeared in the weekly [[Moskovskiye Novosti]], authored by an investigative journalist, Igor Korolkov.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Krolkov|first1=Igor|title=Фоторобот не первой свежести|url=http://www.index.org.ru/turma/ic/2003/213/739-7.htm|agency=[[Moskovskiye Novosti]]|issue=213 (739)|date=11 November 2003}}</ref> It described a meeting between [[Mikhail Trepashkin]] and Mark Blumenfeld, a former businessman who had rented the basement in the apartment house on Guryanov Street to Gochiyaev, in which Mr Blumenfeld stated that the person who was making use of the Laipanov passport, and who was publicly presented by the investigation as Gochiyaev, was not in fact Gochiyaev. In Lefortovo Prison, Blumenfeld had been shown a photo of someone he was told was Gochiyaev but Blumenfeld replied that he had never seen the man but the investigators insisted that he identify Gochiyaev, at which point Blumenfeld ceased arguing and signed the document. The person who had met Blumenfeld was evidently not the same person depicted in the photograph but was, according to Blumenfeld, a man with a simple face whereas the person Blumenfeld had actually met looked externally like an intellectual. False-Laiponov had been seen by several persons. They all maintained that the original composite photo was very similar to the actual person who rented the storage facilities. The Russian Procuracy General unwittingly substantiated Trepashkin’s claim. Of the four storage premises named (two bombed and two not), the Delo (case) states that the witnesses for three, V.A. Avseev, Mark Blumenfeld and N.A. Gollubeva are not reported to have identified Gochiyaev as False-Laipanov. It should be noted that Blumenfeld’s account was different to the statement that he had signed for the FSB. One witness, Yu.E. Petrunkin, did identify a photograph of Gochiyaev as the man known by him as Laipanov. A driver, V.P.Sinitsyn, hired by False-Laipanov to deliver sacks of sugar, was not reported to have made an identification. Another hired driver, A.V.Prushinskii, stated that he was paid for his work by a man in glasses, about 1.8m tall, similar to the composite photo of Laipanov. It should be noted that Prushinskii was not shown an actual photo of Gochiyaev, even though one existed (it had been shown to Petrunkin).<ref name="moscowbombings"/><br/> <br/>@@ -108,7 +108,7 @@\n<br/> <br/> {{cquote|Gochiyayev was from the Karachayevo-Cherkessia Republic, but he had been living in Moscow for more than ten years.

And he would have asked his family to leave the city for a safer place. For that reason, the more I investigated, the more I was sure that he didn’t organise the bombings. I sent an official request to the FSB to check the militia printouts and verify that Gochiyayev had really made those phone calls, but I found only obstacles on my way. I’m sure Gochiyayev had nothing to do with the attacks, but he was the ideal candidate: His liking for Wahhabi ideas was well-known. }}<br/> <br/>-Other researchers have criticized the theory, stating that it is a [[conspiracy theory]].

According to Scientology, lower positions on the tone scale indicate more intricate problems and greater difficulties in solving them for lack of communication. According to Hubbard, communication is the universal solvent and a person will climb from the bottom to the top by improving his ability to communicate. The higher the person’s tone is the better the person’s communication is; the lower the tone is the worse the communication is.

He extended this view further in Scientology, declaring that "thetans" have existed for tens of trillions of years (several [[orders of magnitude]] greater than what mainstream science generally estimates the [[age of the universe]] to be). During that time, Hubbard says, they have been exposed to a vast number of traumatic incidents, and have made a great many decisions that influence their present state. Hubbard's 1958 book ''[[Have You Lived Before This Life]]'' contains descriptions of past lives given by individual Scientologists during auditing sessions. According to an early lecture of Hubbard's, it is, as a practical matter, both impossible and undesirable to recall each and every such event from such vast stretches of time.<ref>20th ACC, 7 August 1958, Lecture #19 "The most basic rock of all"</ref>  As a result, Hubbard's three-decade development of Scientology focused on addressing only "key factors."<br/>+<br/>+According to Hubbard, some past traumas may have been deliberately inflicted in the form of "implants" used by extraterrestrial dictatorships such as [[Helatrobus]] to brainwash and control the population.

However, the issuance of the message led to a great deal of public criticism by free-speech advocates.<br/>+<br/>+The Church also began filing lawsuits against those who posted copyrighted texts on the newsgroup and the [[World Wide Web]], and pressed for tighter restrictions on copyrights in general. The Church supported the controversial [[Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act]]. The even more controversial [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] was also strongly promoted by the Church and some of its provisions (notably the [[Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act]]) were heavily influenced by Church litigation against US [[Internet service providers]] over copyrighted Scientology materials that had been posted or uploaded through their servers.<br/>+<br/>+Beginning in the middle of 1996 and for several years after, the newsgroup was attacked by anonymous parties using a tactic dubbed "[[sporgery]]" by some, in the form of hundreds of thousands of forged spam messages posted on the group. Although the Church neither confirmed nor denied its involvement with the spam, some investigators said that some spam had been traced to Church members. Former Scientologist [[Tory Christman]], after she left the Church, confessed to having been part of the sporgery project, taking money supplied by the [[Office of Special Affairs]] to open up Internet accounts at various ISPs under false names, accounts from which she later saw forged and garbled communications going out.<ref>[http://www.lermanet.com/cos/toryonosa.htm#Part6 "The Secret

MLC controlled the northern part of DRC and its rebels were stationed on the other side of the [[Ubangi river]] from Bangui. The MLC executed between 60 and 120 persons, mainly from the Yakoma tribe and committed atrocities–including killing, looting and rape–against the population. This terror and the crimes carried out during MLC's war against Bozizé's rebels between October 2002 and March 2003 is now being investigated by the [[International Criminal Court]], which says it has identified 600 rape victims and the real numbers are expected to be higher.<ref name=d>[http://web.archive.org/web/20070614084915/http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/press/pressreleases/ICC-OTP-BN-20070522-220_A_EN.pdf – International Criminal Court: Background – Situation in the Central African Republic, 22 May 2007] {{Wayback|url=http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/press/pressreleases/ICC-OTP-BN-20070522-220_A_EN.pdf|date =20070627171746}}</ref><br/> <br/> Most of the crimes were committed by Congolese MLC soldiers, but Bozizé's rebels, including elements from Chad, were also responsible.<ref name=e>[http://www.sangonet.com/actu-snews/santeah/fich-RCA-unhcr2005.pdf – UNHCR: Fiche Pays République Centrafricaine, January 2005]</ref> During Bozizé's time in power, new clashes have taken place between his soldiers and the MLC. Bozizé has strengthened military presence along the border and deployed an amphibious force patrolling the Ubangi river. There were refugees from DRC in C.A.R. from July 1999 (when Kabila advanced in the region bordering C.A.R.). The refugees were repatriated following an agreement between UNHCR and the governments of the two countries in 2004. Refugees from C.A.R. in DRC were beginning to be repatriated in July 2004.<ref name=e/><br/></td>

Examples of such usage are [[William Faulkner|William Faulkner's]] ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]'' and [[William Wordsworth|William Wordsworth's]] ''[[The Idiot Boy]]''. Idiot characters in literature are often confused with or subsumed within mad or lunatic characters.

In [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Fyodor Dostoevsky's]] novel ''[[The Idiot (novel)|The Idiot]]'', the idiocy of the main character, Prince Lev Nikolaievich Myshkin, is attributed more to his honesty, trustfulness, kindness, and humility, than to a lack of intellectual ability.

She continued on as a councillor until 1993. During this period, she made several unsuccessful attempts to secure ALP preselection for a seat in either State or Federal parliament. At one time she was a member of the splinter Left faction the [[Pledge Left]], where she appeared likely to obtain preselection partly due to the support she received from her brother Frank Argondizzo, a then official at the Vehicle Builders Union. Tensions emerged within the Pledge Left about her candidacy and she was not selected as a result. She returned to the Socialist Left faction soon after.<br/></td>

It is ''not'' identical with the [[Akita Inu]] ("Japanese" Akita). Note that in 2006 the [[Fédération Cynologique Internationale|FCI]]-designation ''Great Japanese Dog'' was officially changed to ''American Akita''.<br/> <br/>-== Appearance ==<br/>-The breed stands 24 to 28 inches at the [[withers]] (60 to 71 cm). Females weigh anywhere from 70-100 pounds (30-45kg). Males are 75-120 pounds (35-55 kg).  In Japan, Akitas come in only four colours: Red Fawn, Sesame (red fawn hairs with black tips), Brindle, and White. All except white must have whitish hair on the sides of the muzzle, on the cheeks, the neck, chest, body and tail.<br/>+==Physical description==<br/>+Akitas are most striking and impressive creatures with an attitude of nobility and an appearance of strength and power. Their most noticeable physical characteristic is a large, bear-like head with erect, triangular ears set at a slight angle following the arch of the neck. They have thick, stand-offish coats, and tight cat feet, well knuckled up. Their tails curl over the top of the back in a graceful sweep down the loin, into a gentle curl, or into a double curl. Their colors are rich and clear, like paint on a canvas.<br/> <br/>-All colors are accepted in the American Akita. The Pinto color is not accepted as a Japanese Akita color, but only as an American Akita color. In the U.S., however, some breeders still interbeed the original Japanese type with the heavier American type, which is larger, and allows more colors. It is felt by a few that combining the two types leads to improved appearance and genetic health by increasing genetic diversity.  In the United States, there is only a single Akita breed, whereas they are separated into two breeds in every other country in the world except Canada.  Akitas from Japan and Akitas from the U.S. and other countries are all registered with the American Kennel Club as "Akitas."  In other countries the breed has been separated into two breeds: the Akita and the American Akita. However, the American Akita is acknowledged by many knowledgeable American breeders as being a different breed than the Japanese and these breeders advocate a splitting of the one breed into two.<br/>-[[Image:NinasDuckie.jpg|right|thumb|White Akita with black face]]<br/>+Mature males measure at least 25 inches at the withers and weigh more than 100 pounds. Mature females measure at least 23 inches and weigh approximately 80 pounds.<br/> <br/>-== Temperament ==<br/>-Although the [[American Kennel Club]] has put the Akita in the [[Working Group (dogs)|Working Group]], several different breeds contributed to the modern Akita, some hunting dogs and some dogs used as competitive fighting dogs, however it must be made clear that the common 'Japanese Fighting Dog' moniker is inaccurate. While the Akita's ancestry may lie with dogs used for fighting (see the Edo Period below) the modern day Akita is a long way from this and indeed most good breeders will not breed from dogs that are known to have aggressive natures. In general the Akita is very laid back, and has an easy-going temperament which makes it a very good family environment pet.  <br/>+Recognized by the [[American Kennel Club]] in 1973, the Akita is a rather new breed in the [[United States]]. It has grown steadily in popularity, in part because of its extraordinary appearance and in part because of its captivating personality.<br/> <br/>-Akitas are a large breed, not a giant breed.  They are excellent house dogs.  They require only a moderate amount of exercise.  Akitas are known to be very quiet dogs, only barking "when there is something to bark about".<br/>+==History of the breed==<br/>+The Akita character is the result of centuries of breeding in [[Japan]]. [[Japanese history]], both verbal and written, describe the Akita as one of the oldest of the native dogs. Centuries ago the breed was owned only by the [[Shogun]], the [[imperial]] leaders of the country. The Akita developed in the Akita prefecture, the northernmost region of the island of [[Honshū]]. Bred to hunt, guard, and herd, this swift, agile, unswervingly tenacious dog tracked large game and held it at bay until the royal hunters arrived to make the kill but there were hundreds of incidents when the akita would attack without being told. The Akita's quarry included elk, antelope, boar, and the 120 stone [[Yezo bear]].<br/> <br/>-The two most outstanding characteristics of the Akita as a house pet are that they are very clean and that they are very easy to [[house break]].  Akitas have been described as almost "cat-like," as they are clean and odorless.  This may also be one of the reasons why they housebreak so easily.  Most Akitas respond so well to housebreaking that they are trained in a matter of weeks, although it may take longer if other "slower learning" dogs are present.  <br/>+As a guard dog, the Akita was unsurpassed in its keen senses of smell, sight, and hearing. By nature a quiet dog that barked only when threatened, the breed needed no training in its guard duties. As a herding dog, it fiercely protected livestock from savage predators in the mountainous terrain of [[Akita Prefecture]].<br/> <br/>-As far as the family children are concerned, there are few worries.  Akitas are devoted, patient friends and protectors of children.  Akitas are typically very gentle with children, and it is said that Japanese mothers often left their children with only the Akitas to watch over and protect them.  Remember, however, that young children should never be left unattended with a pet. And while an Akita may love "his" children, he will not necessarily love their friends, especially when they run around the yard and scream.  When raised indoors with children, they can be excellent companions.  <br/>+During the late 1800s, the Akita breed suffered two major setbacks. First, the Akita was crossed with the Japanese fighting dog, the [[Tosa Inu|Tosa]]. This [[crossbreeding]] resulted in a dog of imposing size and aggression used extensively when [[dog fighting]] was a popular sport in Japan. Then, at the turn of the century, Japan had a fatal outbreak of [[rabies]] with more than 3000 cases reported. Dogs, both healthy and affected, were clubbed to death.<br/> <br/>-Left unattended in the backyard or in a kennel, they tend to develop "personality" problems and become very destructive to the yard, which is due to boredom.  They are highly pack oriented, thus, isolating them from the pack (i.e., the owner) causes them great stress.<br/>+However, three events focused positive attention on the breed in the early 1900s.<br/> <br/>-Akitas tend to be stubborn and require a firm but loving education where "no" always means "no" and never "whatever".<br/>+First was the story of [[Hachikō]], one of the most revered Japanese Akitas of all time. He was born in 1923 and was owned by [[Professor Eizaburo Ueno]] of [[Tokyo]]. Professor Ueno lived near the [[Shibuya Station|Shibuya Train Station]] in a suburb of the city and commuted to work every day on the train. [[Hachikō]] accompanied his master to and from the station each day.<br/> <br/>-The Akita is a dominant dog who may expect other dogs to be submissive. If they fail to live up to the Akita's expectations, incidents can happen. <br/>+On May 25, 1925, when the dog was 18 months old, he waited for his master's arrival on the four o'clock train. But he waited in vain; Professor Ueno had suffered a fatal stroke at work. Hachikō continued to wait for his master's return. He traveled to and from the station each day for the next nine years. He allowed the professor's relatives to care for him, but he never gave up the vigil at the station for his master. His vigil became world renowned, and shortly after his death, a bronze statue was erected at the train station in his honor. Then, in 1931, The Akita was officially declared a Japanese Natural Monument. The Mayor of [[Odate City]] in the Akita Prefecture organized the [[Akita Inu Hozankai]] to preserve the original Akita as a national treasure through careful breeding.<br/> <br/>-Akitas have a high and well-developed prey drive, particularly to small animals, including cats.  An Akita is not likely to shower affection on someone that is not a member of his family or a close friend that he sees frequently, and can be extremely aloof. Akitas properly socialized and raised with other animals usually accept them as members of the family. <br/>+The third positive event was the arrival of [[Helen Keller]] in Japan in 1937. She expressed a keen interest in the breed and was presented with the first two Akitas to enter the US. The first dog died at a young age, but the second became Keller's constant companion until his death in 1945.<br/> <br/>-The loyalty and devotion displayed by an Akita is phenomenal.  The typical pet Akita will follow you from room to room, yet has the uncanny ability not to be underfoot.  Your Akita lives his life as if his only purpose is to protect you and spend time with you.  This trait is evident in the tale of [[Hachikō]].<br/>+However, just as the breed was stabilizing in its native land, [[World War II]] pushed the Akita to the brink of extinction. Early in the war the dogs suffered from lack of nutritious food. Then many were killed to be eaten by the starving populace, and their [[pelts]] were used as clothing. Finally, the government ordered all remaining dogs to be killed on sight to prevent the spread of disease. The only way concerned owners could save their beloved Akitas was to turn them loose in the most remote mountain areas. There the breed's hardiness and keen hunting instincts helped them survive the war years.<br/> <br/>-Akitas may, however, have a tendency to be very aggressive to other dogs and small animals and have a strong prey drive.<ref>http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/akita.htm]</ref> It is not uncommon for an Akita to catch and kill small (or even large) animals (including cats, guinea pigs, rabbits and small dogs) if it is allowed to wander and should therefore never be allowed to run off its lead around other animals.<ref>[http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=Akita]</ref><br/>+During the occupation years following the war, the breed began to thrive again. US servicemen fell in love with the Akita and smuggled many of them into the US when they returned.<br/> <br/>-==Health==<br/>-===Mortality===<br/>-Akitas in UK and USA/Canada surveys had a median lifespan of about 10 years,<ref name="Cassidy Data">http://users.pullman.com/lostriver/breeddata.htm Dog Longevity Web Site, Breed Data page.

Retrieved March 17, 2007 </ref><br/>+Because it is a large dog, the Akita is certainly not a breed for everyone. Its personality is that of a survivor. Even though centuries have passed since the [[Shogun warrior]] owned Akitas, the breed still exhibits keen hunting prowess, extraordinary strength and endurance, and the ability to survive on its own. Akita owners must channel these attributes into early obedience training so that their dogs become good canine citizens rather than neighborhood bullies.<br/> <br/>-===Morbidity===<br/>-Some of the health conditions known to affect this breed include:<br/>-* [[Canine herpesvirus]], a strain of the [[Herpes virus]] that happens to affect canines<br/>-* [[Bloat|Gastric dilatation volvulus]] (GDV), a condition associated with bloat;<br/>-* [[Pemphigus]], which causes the autoimmune system to attack the dog's skin (leading to [[pustules]])<br/>-* [[Progressive retinal atrophy]] (PRA), an adult-onset condition which gradual degeneration in the eye cells (i.e. rods & cones)<br/>-* [[Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome|UveoDermatological Syndrome]] (UDS)<ref>[http://www.jawt.co.uk/vkh.html]</ref>, known as [[Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada]] (VKH) disease in humans<br/>-* Sebaceous [[adenitis]], an autoimmune condition which attacks and destroys the dog's [[sebaceous glands]]<br/>-* Canine [[Hip Dysplasia]]<br/>-*[[Hypothyroidism]]<br/>+The Akita learns quickly and can become bored easily. Those who don't understand the breed often describe it as stubborn, when in fact, the dog is exhibiting improper training. The Akita thrives on the love and respect of its master and, with constant reinforcement training and a little creativity, can be a very good worker.<br/> <br/>-===Gastric Dilatiation Volvulus (GDV = "Bloat" or "Torsion")===<br/>-Akita owners should take special note of the high incidence of GDV ([[Gastric dilatation volvulus]]) in this breed. Excess gas trapped in the dog's stomach causes "bloat." Twisting of the stomach (volvulus or "torsion") causes or is caused by excess gas.  GDV is an emergency condition requiring immediate veterinary treatment.  Akita owners should be alert to the symptoms of GDV and know the location of the nearest emergency veterinary facility.<br/>+The Akita was never bred to live or work in groups like many hound and sporting breeds. Instead, they lived and worked singly or in pairs, a preference reflected today. The individual Akita is happy being an only dog or one of two dogs in a household, but can be very aggressive towards animals not part of his family group, particularly strange dogs. A properly trained Akita will learn to tolerate other animals and not go looking for trouble, but the owner must never forget his dog's inherent drive to be top dog at almost any cost.<br/> <br/>-== History ==<br/>-The Akita's ancestors were dogs used by [[matagi]] for hunting.  These dogs, usually called matagi inu, were not as large as modern Akita dogs. Many of these dogs were used as guard dogs. They were also used in the sport of hunting bears.<br/>-[[Image:Akita Stamp.jpg|thumb|An Akita on a Japanese postage stamp]]<br/>-===Edo Period===<br/>-In the [[Edo Period]], [[Dewa Province]] (present-day Akita prefecture) was ruled by the [[Satake clan]].  Since the Satake were tozama [[daimyo]] (considered potentially rebellious), they received severe restrictions by the [[Tokugawa Shogunate]] in all military areas.  The clan decided to encourage [[dog fighting]] around [[1630]] in order to make it possible for the [[samurai]] to retain their aggressive edge in a way that would not offend the shogunate.  Dog fighting became especially popular in the [[Odate]] area.  Dog fighting enthusiasts in the area began to interbreed matagi inu with dogs indigenous to the area.  These dogs, which later turned into the Akita, were called Odate inu at that time.<br/>+There are many pluses to owning an Akita. They are affectionate to their owners and are excellent watchdogs, although they do not bark unless something is amiss. They require only moderate exercise, adjust well to apartment living as long as they receive daily walks, do not eat large quantities of food, and are long-lived. Negatives to ownership include a twice-a-year shedding of the thick, downy undercoat; the size and strength of the breed which, if not properly managed, can become a nightmare; and the predisposition to be aggressive to other dogs.<br/> <br/>-===Before World War II===<br/>-After the [[Meiji Restoration]], people began to breed Akita with many dogs from other regions in Japan, such as the [[Tosa (dog)|Tosa]].  The Meiji Restoration also ended Japan's closed door policy, and large, western dogs began to enter Japan.  As a result, Akita were also bred with [[German shepherd|German Shepherds]], [[Great Dane]]s, and [[Mastiff]]s.  This resulted in the breed losing many of its [[spitz]]-like characteristics.  Akita were later bred with [[Hokkaido (dog)|Hokkaido]] and [[Karafuto (dog)|Karafuto]] dogs (also known as the [[Sakhalin Husky]]), which were introduced to mainland Japan after the [[First Sino-Japanese War]].  <br/> <br/>-In the [[Taisho Period]], people such as the mayor of Odate Town began a movement to preserve the Akita breed.  By  this time, the Akita had begun to turn into a mixed breed as a result of excessive breeding with other dogs.  [[Watase Shozaburo]], a Japanese [[zoologist]] that successfully proposed the Law for Protection of Natural Monuments (天然記念物保護法) also worked towards preserving the Akita breed.  As a result, the Akitainu Introduction Foundation (秋田犬保存会) was created in May [[1927]] by the mayor of Odate, and nine Akita dogs were designated as natural monuments in [[1931]].  In [[1932]], the  faithful Akita dog [[Hachikō]] was featured in an article in the [[Asahi Shimbun]] newspaper, which contributed to the popularity of the breed.  When [[Helen Keller]] visited Akita prefecture in [[1937]], she expressed that she would like to have an Akita dog.  An Akita called Kamikaze-go was given to her within a month.  When Kamikaze-go later died because of [[canine distemper]], his brother, Kenzan-go, was promptly sent to her.  By [[1938]] a breed standard had been established and dog shows had been held, but such activities stopped after [[World War II]] began.<br/>-<br/>-===The War and its aftermath===<br/>-During World War II, the number of Akita dogs greatly diminished because  of the lack of food.  There were also orders to capture all dogs except German shepherds, in order to use their fur for warm army uniforms.  Many people bred Akitas with shepherds to avoid capture.  When the war ended in [[1945]], there were fewer than twenty purebred Akita dogs in Japan.<br/>-<br/>-However, the Akita became quite popular during the postwar period.  Many occupation soldiers liked the Akita, because it was by far the largest Japanese dog.  The fact that [[Helen Keller]] had an Akita also became well-known when she came to Japan in [[1948]] and thanked people in Akita for the dogs she was given.  Most of the Akita dogs at this time had many German Shepherd-like characteristics.  These dogs are currently known as Dewa line, or Dewa type Akitas.<br/>-<br/>-== Miscellaneous ==<br/>-* Recent [[DNA analysis]] confirms that this is one of the most [[ancient dog breeds|primitive breeds of dog]].<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/21/science/21dog.html?ex=1400472000&en=6b49c839cde80d81&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND Collie or Pug?

When his owner died, Hachikō returned to the train station every day for the rest of his life to wait for him.  A life-size statue of Hachikō still stands at [[Shibuya Station]].<br/>-<br/>-== Akita Inu in Popular Culture ==<br/>-* Many manga titles by Takahashi Yoshihiro feature Akita dogs as the main character.  These include Gin of ''[[Ginga: Nagareboshi Gin]]'' and Weed of ''[[Ginga Densetsu Weed]]''.

A yōkai is a legendary [[Japan]]ese creature that is said to take human form.<br/>-*In the musical ''[[Rent]]'', Angel gets paid $1,000 to get rid of a wealthy woman's neighbor's Akita named Evita. Later on, it becomes clear that Evita's owner was the wife of Benny, the despised landlord of the group of friends.  Benny later confides that he hated the dog anyway.<br/>-* In the anime [[Kino's Journey]], the character Riku appears to be an Akita.<br/>-*In the manga ''[[Nana (manga)]]'', one of the title characters is given the nickname Hachiko in reference to her dog-like loyalty being similar to that of the famous dog Hachiko.<br/>-*[[Nicole Brown Simpson]]'s dog in the [[O.J.

In practice, "tolerance" indicates support for practices that prohibit ethnic and religious [[discrimination]]. Conversely, 'intolerance' may be used to refer to the discriminatory practices sought to be prohibited. Though developed to refer to the [[religious toleration]] of minority religious sects following the [[Protestant Reformation]], these terms are increasingly used to refer to a wider range of tolerated practices and groups, or of political parties or ideas widely considered objectionable.<ref>http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Toleration</ref><br/>-<br/>-The concept of toleration is controversial. For one, "toleration" does not raise the level of an actual [[principle]] or [[ethic]], such as other concepts (respect, [[Ethic of reciprocity|reciprocity]], love) do. [[liberalism|Liberal]] critics may see in it an inappropriate implication that the "tolerated" custom or behavior is an [[aberration]] or that authorities have a right to [[punishment|punish]] difference; such critics may instead emphasise notions such as [[Civic virtue|civility]], [[pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]], or respect. Other critics may regard a narrow definition of 'tolerance' as more useful, since it does not require a false [[expression]] of enthusiasm for groups or practices which are genuinely disapproved of.<br/>-<br/>-As a practical matter, governments have always had to consider the question of which groups and practices to tolerate and which to persecute. The [[Edicts of Ashoka]] issued by [[Ashoka the Great]] in the [[Maurya Empire]] declared ethnic and religious tolerance. The later expanding [[Roman Empire]] faced the question of whether or to what extent practices or beliefs could be tolerated or vigorously persecuted. Likewise, during the [[Middle Ages]], the rulers of [[Christendom|Christian Europe]] or the [[Islamic Golden Age|Muslim Middle East]] sometimes extended toleration to minority religious groups, and sometimes did not. Jews in particular suffered under [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] persecutions in medieval [[Europe]].<ref name="Vartan">Vartan Gregorian, "Islam: A Mosaic, Not a Monolith", Brookings Institution Press, 2003, pg 26-38 ISBN 081573283X</ref><ref>[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=412&letter=G&search=Granada Granada] by Richard Gottheil, Meyer Kayserling, ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''. 1906 ed.</ref> A notable exception was [[Poland]], which served as a haven for European Jewry because of its relative tolerance - by the mid-sixteenth century, 80 percent of the world’s Jews lived in Poland. <ref>[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Poland.html Jewish Virtual Library - Poland]</ref><br/>-<br/>-An early champion of toleration in Europe was [[Pawel Wlodkowic]], who at the [[Council of Constance]] advocated the [[pagan]] nations' rights.<ref>[http://original.britannica.com/eb/article-28175/Poland#396759.hook Britannica Online - Poland: The rule of Jagielo ]</ref> However, the development of a body of theory on the subject of toleration didn't begin until the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, in response to the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the [[Wars of Religion]] and persecutions that followed the breaks with the [[Catholic Church]] instigated by [[Martin Luther]] and [[Huldrych Zwingli]] and others.  In response to the theory of persecution that was used to justify wars of religion and the execution of persons convicted of [[heresy]] and [[witchcraft]], writers such as [[Sebastian Castellio]] and [[Michel de Montaigne]] questioned the morality of religious persecution, and offered arguments for toleration. By contrast, Poland, which had been uniquely tolerant and ethnically as well as religiously diverse, officially confirmed its status as "a place of shelter for heretics" in the [[Warsaw Confederation | Confederation of Warsaw of 1573]],<ref>[http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=7748&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html Portal UNESCO, Poland - The General Confederation of Warsaw]</ref> the first toleration act in Europe.<ref>[http://www.polityka.pl/archive/do/registry/secure/showArticle?id=945 Dzieje podzielone, Prof. Janusz Tazbir, Polityka 03-07-2004]</ref><br/>-<br/>-A detailed and influential body of writing on the question of toleration was produced in [[Great Britain|Britain]] in the seventeenth century, during and after the destructive [[English Civil Wars]]. [[John Milton]] and radical Parliamentarians such as [[Gerrard Winstanley]] argued that Christian and Jewish worship should be protected, and it was during the period that [[Oliver Cromwell]] allowed the return of Jews to England.  These early theories of toleration were limited however, and did not extend toleration to [[Roman Catholics]] (who were perceived as disloyal to their country) or [[atheists]] (who were held to lack any moral basis for action).  [[John Locke]], in his [[A Letter Concerning Toleration|Letter Concerning Toleration]] and [[Two Treatises of Government]] proposed a more detailed and systematic theory of toleration, which included a principle of [[Separation of Church and State]] that formed the basis for future constitutional democracies.  The British [[Toleration Act of 1689]] was the political result of seventeenth century theorists and political exigency, which despite the limited scope of the toleration it granted was nevertheless a key development in the history of toleration, which helped produce greater political stability in the British Isles.<br/>-  <br/>-The philosophers and writers of the [[The Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], especially [[Voltaire]] and [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]], promoted and further developed the notion of religious tolerance, which however was not sufficient to prevent the atrocities of the [[Reign of Terror]].  The incorporation by [[Thomas Jefferson]] and others of Locke's theories of toleration into the [[Constitution of the United States of America]] was arguably more successful.<br/>-<br/>-== Recent development ==<br/>-Though developed to refer to the [[religious toleration]] of minority religious sects following the [[Protestant Reformation]], the terms "toleration" and "tolerance" are increasingly used to refer to a wider range of tolerated practices and groups, such as the toleration of sexual practices and orientations, or of political parties or ideas widely considered objectionable.  Changing applications and understandings of the term can sometimes make debate on the question difficult.<br/>-<br/>-For example, a distinction is sometimes drawn between mere "Toleration" and a higher notion of "Religious Liberty":  <br/>-<br/>-<blockquote>Some philosophers [. . .] regard toleration and religious freedom as quite distinct things and emphasize the differences between the two.  They understand toleration to signify no more than forbearance and the permission given by the adherents of a dominant religion for other religions to exist, even though the latter are looked upon with disapproval as inferior, mistaken, or harmful.  In contrast these thinkers recognize religious liberty as as the recognition of equal freedom for all religions and denominations without any kind of discrimination among them [. . .] in the case of religious liberty, no one is rightfully possessed of the power not to tolerate or to cancel this liberty.<ref name=Zagorin5>Zagorin, Perez (2003) ''How the Idea of Religious Toleration Came to the West'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press).</ref></blockquote><br/>-<br/>-Discussions of toleration therefore often divided between those who view the term as a minimal and perhaps even historical virtue (perhaps today to be replaced by a more positive and robust appreciation of [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]] or [[Multiculturalism|diversity]]), and those who view it as a concept with an important continuing vitality, and who are more likely to use the term in considering contemporary issues regarding discrimination on the basis of race, nationality, gender, sexuality, disability, and other reasons.<br/>-<br/>-There are also debates with regard to the historical factors that produced the principle of toleration, as well as to the proper reasons toleration should be exercised, with some arguing that the growth of [[skepticism]] was an important or necessary factor in the development of toleration, and others arguing that religious belief or an evolving notion of respect for individual persons was or is the basis on which toleration was or should be practiced.<br/>-<br/>-== Tolerance and monotheism ==<br/>-One theory of the origins of religious intolerance, propounded by [[Sigmund Freud]] in ''Moses and Monotheism,'' links intolerance to monotheism.  More recently, [[Bernard Lewis]] and Mark Cohen have argued that the modern understanding of tolerance, involving concepts of national identity and equal citizenship for persons of different religions, was not considered a value by pre-modern Muslims or Christians, due to the implications of monotheism.<ref>Lewis (1997), p.321; (1984) p.65; Cohen (1995), p.xix</ref> The historian [[Geoffrey Rudolph Elton|G.R. Elton]] explains that in pre-modern times, monotheists viewed such toleration as a sign of weakness or even wickedness towards God. <ref>  quoted in Cohen (1995), p.xix</ref> The usual definition of tolerance in pre-modern times as Bernard Lewis puts it was that: <br/>-<br/>-{{cquote|I am in charge. I will allow you some though not all of the rights and privileges that I enjoy, provided that you behave yourself according to rules that I will lay down and enforce."<ref name=LewisBrandeis1>Lewis (2006), pp.25-36</ref>}}<br/>-<br/>-[[Mark Cohen]] states that it seems that all the monotheistic religions in power throughout the history have felt it proper, if not obligatory, to persecute nonconforming religions. <ref name="Cohen1"> Cohen (1995) p. xix </ref> Therefore, Cohen concludes, [[Islamic Golden Age|Medieval Islam]] and [[Middle Ages|Medieval Christianity]] in power should have persecuted non-believers in their lands and "Judaism, briefly in power during the Hasmonean period (second century BCE) should have persecuted pagan Idumeans". <ref name="Cohen1"/> Cohen continues: "When all is said and done, however, the historical evidence indicates that the [[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain|Jews of Islam]], especially during the formative and classical centuries (up to thirteenth century), experienced much less persecution than did the Jews of [[Christendom]]. This begs a more thorough and nuanced explanation than has hitherto been given."<ref name="Cohen1"/><br/>-<br/>-==Tolerating the intolerant==<br/>-Philosopher [[Karl Popper]]'s assertion in ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'' that we are warranted in refusing to tolerate intolerance illustrates that there are limits to tolerance.<br/>-<br/>-In particular, should a tolerant society tolerate intolerance? What if by tolerating action "A", society destroys itself? Tolerance of "A" could be used to introduce a new thought system leading to intolerance of vital institution "B". It is difficult to strike a balance and different societies do not always agree on the details, indeed different groups within a single society also often fail to agree. The current suppression of [[Nazism]] in [[Germany]] is considered intolerant by some countries, for instance, while in Germany itself it is Nazism which is considered intolerably intolerant.<br/>-<br/>-Philosopher [[John Rawls]] devotes a section of his influential and controversial book ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' to the problem of whether a just society should or should not tolerate the intolerant, and to the related problem of whether or not, in any society, the intolerant have any right to complain when they are not tolerated.<br/>-<br/>-Rawls concludes that a just society must be tolerant; therefore, the intolerant must be tolerated, for otherwise, the society would then be intolerant, and so unjust. However, Rawls qualifies this by insisting that society and its social institutions have a reasonable right of self-preservation that supersedes the principle of tolerance. Hence, the intolerant must be tolerated but ''only insofar as they do not endanger the tolerant society and its institutions''.<br/>-<br/>-Similarly, continues Rawls, while the intolerant might forfeit the right to complain when they are themselves not tolerated, other members of society have a right, perhaps even a duty, to complain on their behalf, again, as long as society itself is not endangered by these intolerant members. The [[ACLU]] is a good example of a social institution that protects the rights of the intolerant, as it frequently defends the right to free speech of such intolerant organizations as the [[Ku Klux Klan]].<br/>-<br/>-== References ==<br/>-<br/>+{{Expand|date=January 2007}}<br/>+{{Mergewith|Toleration|date=July 2008}}<br/>+{{For|the Religioustolerance.org website|Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance}}<br/>+[[Image:CrossMenorahOxford 20051225KaihsuTai.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Christian cross|cross]] of the [[war memorial]] and a [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]] for [[Hanukkah]] coexist in [[Oxford]].]]<br/>+<br/>+'''Religious toleration''' is the condition of accepting or permitting others' [[religion|religious]] beliefs and practices which disagree with one's own.<br/>+<br/>+In a country with a [[state religion]], ''toleration'' means that the government permits religious practices of other sects besides the state religion, and does not persecute believers in other faiths. It is a partial status, and might still be accompanied by forms of [[religious discrimination]]. Religious toleration as a Government policy merely means the absence of [[religious persecution]]; unlike [[religious liberty]] it does not mean that religions are equal before the law. Toleration is a [[privilege]] granted by Government (which it may do by law or charter), not a [[right]] against it; governments have often tolerated some religions and not others.   <br/>+<br/>+Religious toleration "as a government-sanctioned practice — the sense on which most discussion of the phenomenon relies —<br/>+is not attested before the sixteenth century", which makes it rather difficult to apply the concept to topics like [[Persecution of religion in ancient Rome]].<ref>H.A.Drake, ''Lambs into Lions: explaining early Christian intolerance'', Past and Present 153 (1996), p.8, [http://past.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/153/1/3 Oxford Journals] </ref> <br/>+<br/>+Historically, toleration has been a contentious issue within many religions as well as between one religion and another. At issue is not merely whether other faiths should be permitted, but also whether a ruler who is a believer may be tolerant, or permit his subordinates to be. In the [[Middle Ages]], toleration of [[Judaism]] was a contentious issue throughout [[Christendom]]. Today, there are concerns about toleration of [[Christianity]] in [[Sharia|Islamic states]] (see also [[dhimmi]]).<br/>+<br/>+[[Proselytism]] can be a contentious issue; it can be regarded as an offence against the validity of others' religions, or as an expression of one's own faith.<br/>+<br/>+==The element of objection== <br/>+<br/>+For individuals, religious toleration generally means an attitude of acceptance towards other people's religions. It does not mean that one views other religions as equally true; merely that others have the right to hold and practice their beliefs. This element of objection is important. People, who take these matters seriously, often experience distress when they are confronted with religious beliefs that they regard as idolatrous, [[Superstition|superstitious]], [[Heresy|heretical]] or [[Schism (religion)|schismatic]]. <br/>+<br/>+==Contexts of religious tolerance== <br/>+<br/>+At least five contexts of religious tolerance can be distinguished. Religious tolerance as a state sanctioned practice can more precisely termed ''civil tolerance''. Civil tolerance is concerned with "the policy of the state towards religious dissent".<ref>Coffey 2000: 11</ref> In contrast to this, ecclesiastical tolerance is concerned with the degree of diversity tolerated within a particular church.<ref>Coffey 2000: 12</ref> Without this distinction, the [[Christian debate on persecution and toleration]] in England could not be adequately understood.   <br/>+<br/>+Furthermore, there is also a ''social'' and a ''polemical'' context of religious tolerance. The grand theme of ''divine tolerance'' is the emphasis on "the patience and longsuffering of God" as it is frequently portrayed in the Christian [[Bible]]; This image of God has been invoked by early Christian advocates of toleration.  <br/>+<br/>+===The polemical context===<br/>+<br/>+Contemporary authors such as [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Christopher Hitchens]] and [[Daniel C. Dennett]] have all challenged the tolerance of religion. In ''[[The End of Faith]]'', Sam Harris asserts that we should be unwilling to tolerate unjustified beliefs about morality, spirituality, politics, and the origin of humanity. In his [[preface]] to ''[[The God Delusion]]'', Richard Dawkins says, "If this book works as I intend, religious readers who open it will be atheists when they put it down."<ref name="preface">Dawkins, Richard.

It is sometimes called a "counterweight trebuchet" in order to distinguish it from an earlier weapon that has come to be called the "traction trebuchet." Sometimes the word ''trebuchet'' is used to refer ambiguously to either weapon, but originally it referred to the counterweighted weapon.<br/>+<br/>+The counterweight trebuchet appeared in both Christian and Muslim lands around the Mediterranean in the twelfth century. It could fling three hundred pound (140&nbsp;kg) projectiles at high speeds into an enemy fortification, quickly obliterating walls and defenses. Occasionally it was used to throw the bodies of people and animals who had died from various diseases including the [[black plague]] over [[castle walls]], in an attempt to infect the people under siege, being the medieval technology for [[biological warfare]]. Trebuchets were far more accurate than other forms of [[medieval]] [[catapults]].<br/>+<br/>+==History==<br/>+[[image:Trebuchet2.png|thumb|right|Side view.]]<br/>+The invention of the trebuchet derives from the ancient [[Sling (weapon)|sling]].  A variation of the sling contained a short piece of wood to extend the arm and provide greater leverage.  This was evolved into the traction trebuchet by the Chinese, in which a number of people pull on ropes attached to the short arm of a lever that has a sling on the long arm.  This type of trebuchet is smaller and has a shorter range but is a more portable machine and has a faster rate of fire than a larger counterweight powered one. The smallest traction trebuchets could be powered by the weight and pulling strength of one person using a single rope; but most were designed and sized to utilize from 20 to 100 men, generally two per rope.  These teams would sometimes be local citizens assisting in the siege or in the defense of their town.  Traction trebuchets had a range of from 200 to well over 300 feet (60 to 100+ meters) when casting weights up to 130 pounds (60&nbsp;kg). It is believed that the first traction trebuchets were used in China as early as in the 5th century BC, descriptions of which can be found in the 5th century BC [[Mozi]].  <br/>+<br/>+The traction trebuchet next appears in Byzantium. The ''Strategikon'' of Emperor Maurice, composed in 539, calls for "ballistae revolving in both directions," ('Βαλλίςτρας έκατηρωθεν στρεφόμενας), probably traction trebuchets. (Dennis 1998, p. 99) The ''Miracles of St. Demetrius'', composed by John I, archbishop of Thessalonike, clearly describe traction trebuchets in the Avaro-Slav artillery: "Hanging from the back sides of these pieces of timber were slings and from the front strong ropes, by which, pulling down and releasing the sling, they propel the stones up high and with a loud noise." (John I 597 1:154, ed. Lemerle 1979)<br/>+<br/>+[[Image:Trebuchet1.png|thumb|right|[[19th century]] French three-quarter drawing of a medieval trebuchet.]]<br/>+There is some doubt as to the exact period in which traction trebuchets or knowledge of them reached Scandinavia. The [[Vikings]] may have known them at a very early stage, as the monk Abbo de St. Germain reports on the [[Siege of Paris (885-886)|siege of Paris]] in his epic ''De bello Parisiaco'' dated about 890 AD that engines of war were used. Another source mentions that Nordic people or "the Norsemen" used engines of war at the siege of Angers as early as 873 AD. <br/>+<br/>+Our first clear written record of a counterweight trebuchet comes from an Islamic scholar, Mardi al-Tarsusi, who wrote in 1187, "Trebuchets are machines invented by unbelieving devils." (Al-Tarsusi, Bodleian MS 264) This by itself suggests that by the time of [[Saladin]], Muslims were acquainted with counterweight engines, but did not believe that Muslims had invented them. Al-Tarsusi does not specifically say that the "unbelieving devils" were Christian Europeans, but Saladin was in fact actively engaged against Crusaders for much of his career, and the manuscript predates the Chinese and Mongol weapons. (Needham p. 218)<br/>+<br/>+At the [[Siege of Acre]] in [[1191]], [[Richard the Lionheart]] assembled two trebuchets which he named "[[God's Own Catapult]]" and "[[Bad Neighbour]]". During a siege of [[Stirling Castle]] in 1304, [[Edward I of England|Edward Longshanks]] ordered his engineers to make a giant trebuchet for the English army, named "[[Warwolf]]". Range and size of the weapons varied. In 1421 the future [[Charles VII of France]] commissioned a trebuchet (''coyllar'') that could shoot a stone of 800&nbsp;kg, while in [[1188]] at Ashyun balls up to 1,500&nbsp;kg were used. Average weight of the projectiles was probably around 50-100&nbsp;kg, with a range of ca. 300 meters. Rate of fire could be noteworthy: at the [[siege of Lisbon]] (1147), two engines were capable of launching a stone every 15 seconds. Also human corpses could be used in special occasion: in [[1422]] Prince [[Sigismund Korybut|Korybut]], for example, in the siege of [[Karlštejn]] shot men and manure within the enemy walls, apparently managing to spread infection among the defenders.<br/>+<br/>+Counterweight trebuchets did not appear in [[China]] until [[1273]], at the [[Battle of Xiangyang|Siege of Fancheng and Xiangyang]]. The [[Mongol]] army, unable to capture the cities despite besieging the [[Song Dynasty|Song]] defenders for years, brought in two Persian engineers who built hinged counterweight trebuchets and soon reduced the cities to rubble, forcing the surrender of the garrison. These engines were called by the Chinese historians the Huihui Pao (回回砲) or Xiangyang Pao (襄陽砲) ("huihui" means Muslim), because they were first encountered in that battle.<br/>+<br/>+The largest trebuchets needed exceptional quantities of timber: at the [[siege of Damietta]], in 1249, [[Louis IX of France]] was able to build a stockade for the whole Crusade camp with the wood from 24 captured Egyptian trebuchets. <br/>+<br/>+With the introduction of [[gunpowder]], the trebuchet lost its place as the siege engine of choice to the [[cannon]].  Trebuchets were used both at the [[siege of Burgos]] (1475-1476) and [[siege of Rhodes (1480)|siege of Rhodes]] (1480). The last recorded military use was by [[Hernán Cortés]], at the [[1521]] siege of the Aztec capital [[Tenochtitlán]]. Accounts of the attack note that its use was motivated by the limited supply of gunpowder. The attempt was reportedly unsuccessful: the first projectile landed on the trebuchet itself, destroying it.<br/>+<br/>+In 1779 British forces defending [[Gibraltar]], finding that their cannons were unable to fire far enough for some purposes, constructed a trebuchet. It is unknown how successful this was: the Spanish attackers were eventually defeated, but this was largely due to a [[sortie]].<br/>+<br/>+==Action of the trebuchet==<br/>+A traction trebuchet functions in the same way as a counterweight trebuchet, except that instead of a hoisted weight, the hurling arm is powered by a crew of men, pulling on ropes attached to the short lever arm.  A counterweight trebuchet is powered by a very heavy [[counterweight]], acting on a [[lever]] arm. The fulcrum of the lever (usually an axle) is supported by a high frame, and the counterweight is suspended from the short arm of the lever.  The sling is attached to the end of the long arm of the lever. One end of the sling is captive, while the other end is hooked to the long arm in such a way as to release when the arm and sling reach the optimal hurling angles. The trebuchet is energized by lowering the long arm and raising the weighted short arm, usually with a winch, and is locked into the charged state by a trigger mechanism (cocked). With the long arm lowered near ground level, the sling is loaded with the projectile, and laid out on the ground, with the captive and hooked ends away from the target, and the load and pouch laid on the ground toward the target, under the trebuchet. When the trigger is released, the weighted short arm is driven by gravity into an accelerating pendulum motion, causing the lighter, long arm of the lever to revolve around the fulcrum at the opposite arc, which in turn, pulls the sling and its contents into a whipping motion at the end of the long arm. As the arm continues to swing past the vertical position, the counterweight rises, causing the lever motion to begin to slow down, while the sling continues to whip forward around the end of the long arm. When the sling reaches its launch angle, one end slips from its hook, releasing the projectile toward the target. <br/>+<br/>+Each of the components of the trebuchet affect its performance. The lever is critical. It must be as light as possible, for maximum acceleration, yet strong enough not to break under the stress. The ratio of the length of the long to the short arms of the lever, and to the sling length, are important factors in determining the range of the projectile. The object of a good design is to transfer as much energy as possible from the falling counterweight into the projectile.  The maximum range for a hypothetical 100% energy transfer, <math>R_\textrm{max}</math>, of the projectile can be shown to be <math>R_\textrm{max} = 2 h m_\textrm{c} / m_\textrm{p}</math>, where <math>h</math> is the distance the counterweight falls, and <math>m_\textrm{c}</math> and <math>m_\textrm{p}</math> are the mass of the counterweight and projectile, respectively.  The efficiency of a real trebuchet is then easily determined as the ratio of the actual range achieved to the calculated maximum range.  <br/>+<br/>+Medieval designs were probably carried out by making variations on a scale model and determined empirically. There are no really detailed descriptions of medieval or earlier trebuchets that give, for example, the dimensions or shape of the beam, the ratio of its long arm to its short arm, and so on. No specimens or models from medieval times survive. The few extant contemporary drawings of them are highly schematic and even sometimes show physically impossible proportions. Methods used for optimizing their performance and design were apparently closely held military secrets, and are not available to present-day reconstructors.<br/>+<br/>+Emplacing and aiming the trebuchet was also, no doubt, done by empirical trials. Small adjustments can be made by changing the angle of the hook holding the free end of the sling, a process which requires a heated forge on a full-scale engine. For larger, quicker adjustments, the length of the sling can be altered.  Small adjustments from side-to-side can also be made by moving the channel in which the missile and sling slide in the base of the frame.  The trebuchet itself could be moved as well, but with larger trebuchets, this would have been difficult; the largest trebuchets could weigh many [[ton]]s. <br/>+<br/>+Because of the time required to load the sling and to raise the counterweight, a large trebuchet's rate of fire is slow, often not more than a couple of shots an hour.  This was due both to their sheer size and the massive weight of their counterweights.  Smaller trebuchets can fire a couple of times a minute.  The payload of a trebuchet was usually a large rounded stone, although other projectiles were occasionally used: dead animals, beehives, the severed heads of captured enemies, small stones burned into clay balls which would explode on impact like grapeshot, barrels of burning tar or oil, [[Greek fire]], or even unsuccessful negotiators, prisoners of war, hostages, and captured spies.  Pots of burning lime were also used as projectiles.<br/>+<br/>+Trebuchets were formidably powerful weapons, with a range of up to about 300 [[yard]]s/ 270&nbsp;m. [[Castle]] designers often built their fortifications with trebuchets in mind; for instance, [[Caerphilly Castle]] in [[Wales]] was surrounded by artificial lakes to keep besiegers and their siege weapons at a distance. The range of many trebuchets was in fact shorter than that of an [[English longbow]] in skilled hands, making it somewhat dangerous to be a trebuchet operator during a siege.<br/>+<br/>+A trebuchet can increase its efficiency (and hence either range or payload) by allowing the counterweight to take the straightest possible downward path. This maximizes the transfer of the counterweight's potential energy to the projectile rather than to stressing the frame. Mounting the counterweight on a pivot (below top) straightens the path of its fall, increasing its effectiveness.  A fixed counterweight trebuchet in particular can therefore be made more efficient by the addition of wheels to allow the frame to move freely back and forth (below bottom). This also allowed the trebuchet to fire farther.<br/>+<br/>+The addition of wheels also makes the trebuchet more stable as part of the forward momentum of the falling counterweight is transferred to the forward motion of the trebuchet instead of a tilting action of the vertical frame, possibly tipping over of the machine or severely damaging the structure. The velocity of the trebuchet frame is added to that of the item being thrown, increasing its velocity and range by up to 33 percent. The wheeled trebuchet can effectively employ a fixed counterweight, mounted to the short end of the throwing arm, rather than the pendulum weight described above. The weights were usually stones and rubble, since lead was far too expensive and could be used for better purposes in a siege.<br/>+<br/>+==Modern use==<br/>+Today, many hobbyists build and experiment with trebuchets.  Trebuchets are also used in classrooms to illustrate mechanical and physical principles.  Trebuchets range in size from table-top to huge machines weighing many tons. <br/>+<br/>+The largest working trebuchet of medieval design today is at [[Warwick Castle]], which is used as a tourist attraction and is fired by members of the public under professional supervision. It stands 19&nbsp;m tall and uses a 6&nbsp;tonne counterweight to fire 15&nbsp;kg stone balls distances exceeding several hundred feet. T-Wrecks, a trebuchet with a more contemporary design, can throw pianos weighing 230&nbsp;kg (500 lbs) over 150&nbsp;m (500 ft). In England a group of farmers threw a car close to 120&nbsp;m (400 ft) and a 250 litre (55 [[Imperial gallon]], 66 [[US gallon]]s) drum filled with gasoline over 300&nbsp;m (1000 ft). <br/>+<br/>+Recent modern developments include: the ''floating arm trebuchet''[http://www.trebuchet.com/story.php/fat.html], where the counterweight is constrained to drop down vertically, while the fixed axle is replaced by rollers; a variation is the ''F2K trebuchet''. Other variations are the  "scissor-jack" [http://www.siege-engine.com/ScissorTreb.shtml], "whipper" [http://faculty.ssfs.org/~fullejo/Punkin%20Chunkin/Whipper.htm].  Modern hobbyist trebuchets sometimes replace the counterweight with banks of [[spring (device)|spring]]s[http://www.people.vanderbilt.edu/~frank.v.cioppettini/trebuchet.html].<br/>+<br/>+Another notable variation on the classical trebuchet involves one that props the counterweight in its initial configuration.  Since the center of mass is higher than the conventional one in which the counterweight hangs from the end of the short end of the beam, more energy is available for throwing the projectile.  This is a little more complex, though, and few have been built.  King Arthur, a propped counterweight trebuchet built by the team led by Christopher Gerow, was a [[Punkin Chunkin contest]] champion for four years running.  Its reign was ended in [[2004]] by the huge Yankee Siege[http://www.yankeesiege.com/], video[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lka2VyNHxI], with a record throw of 424.9&nbsp;m (1394 ft). <br/>+<br/>+Another trebuchet type is the multi-rotational trebuchet, which is powered by a weight turning a wheel. Although the wheel allows the counterweight to fall straight down and enables the arm to complete multiple rotations, it creates an important difference that separates multi-rotational trebuchets from others. Whereas the high efficiency of a floating arm trebuchet comes from the constrained motion of the arm in addition to the sling, the high efficiency of a multi-rotational trebuchet comes from the sling alone. Due to the behavior of the sling under multiple rotations, small changes in sling length result in large changes in performance.<br/>+<br/>+A United States organization, [[Science Olympiad]], hosts a "Storm the Castle" event for middle and high school students involving the trebuchet.  The competitors build a small trebuchet that is less than 1 meter on a side (exact dimensions vary from year to year) and are scored based on the distance and accuracy of their throws.<br/>+<br/>+A trebuchet operated by Roloff Farms (featured on the TV show [[Little People, Big World]]) malfunctioned in October 2006, resulting in injuries to two people.<br/>+<br/>+==Etymology==<br/>+Trebuchet  is [[Old French]], from ''trebucher'' "to throw over" &lt; ''tres'' "over, beyond" and ''buc'' "[[torso]]" < [[Latin]]  ''trans'' and a [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] word. <!--the modern French form is ''trébuchet'' which dictionaries define as "bird trap" or "assay balance" but online you can see it refers to the siege engine.  The verb ''trébucher'' now mainly means "to stumble"--><br/>+<br/>+Trebuchets are often referred to as a variety of [[catapult]], though this word is today generally reserved for a device powered by elastic energy.<br/>+<br/>+Other names for counterweight (or counterpoise) trebuchets include ''bricole'' or ''brigola''. <br/>+<br/>+Descriptive terms, such as a "witch with ropes for hair" were used by some sources to describe how a traction trebuchet looks.<br/>+<br/>+== References ==<br/>+*{{cite book|last=Chevedden|first=|Paul E.|coauthors=et al.|chapter=The Trebuchet|title=Scientific American|date=July 1995|pages=66-71}}[http://www.sciamdigital.com/browse.cfm?sequencenameCHAR=item2&methodnameCHAR=resource_getitembrowse&interfacenameCHAR=browse.cfm&ISSUEID_CHAR=4CA7CA53-D436-4BA5-90BC-B62A2E4A4D3&ARTICLEID_CHAR=D79B1CBF-31E0-4E5A-ABEB-A1193B8956F&sc=I100322/]<br/>+*{{cite book|last=Liang|first=Jieming|title=Chinese Siege Warfare: Mechanical Artillery & Siege Weapons of Antiquity - An Illustrated History|publisher= |year=2006}}<br/>+*{{cite book|last=Gravett|first=Peter|title=Medieval Siege Warfare|publisher=Osprey Publishing|year=1990}}<br/>+*{{cite book|last=Archbishop of Thessalonike|first=John I|title=Miracula S.
