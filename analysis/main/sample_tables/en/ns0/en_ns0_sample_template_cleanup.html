The term "gamchha" derives from the Bengali গা মোছা (''gā mochha''), which means "wiping (the) body". Gamchha is the local term for indian towel.However its appearance varies from region to region. Gamchhas are most commonly found with [[Tartan|check]] and striped patterns of red, orange or green. Plain white gamchhas with coloured (embroidered or printed) borders from [[Orissa]] and [[Assam]] are local handicrafts, and may be worn around the neck with traditional Indian attire. In western parts, gamchhas are primarily made in red colour and are plain like cloth. In southern india, gamchhas are more coarse and are available in various dyes. Even grey and pink colours are available in southern gamchhas. In [[Maharashtra]] region light weight turkish towels made at home are also popularly termed as gamchhas. Gamchhas remain popular in India because they are not as thick as Western-style towels and better suited to the country's [[Tropics|tropical, humid]] climate.<br/></td>
